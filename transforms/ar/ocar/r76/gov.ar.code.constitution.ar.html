     Upon petition for temporary injunction against the liquefied petroleum gas control board of Arkansas and its director which was filed in Calhoun County, seeking to prevent the cancelation of his permit to engage in a butane gas business, the court took judicial notice that the official residence of the gas board and its director was Pulaski County, the seat of government as provided in this article; therefore, the proper venue was Pulaski County and not in Calhoun County where the petition was filed.

    <p>
     State courts are concluded on state boundary questions by decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, and Tennessee jurisdiction of island was not changed by avulsion of main channel to other side of island. Kissell v. Stevens, 164 Ark. 195, 261 S.W. 299 (1924).

    <p>
     The determination of the boundaries of the state is a question to be determined by the legislative department. DeLoney v. State, 88 Ark. 311, 115 S.W. 138 (1908).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Section 12-12-919(a)(3), requiring lifetime registration as applied to defendant, did not violate his equal protection rights as there was a rational basis for treating sex offenders convicted under more than one case number differently than those convicted under a single case number. Individuals convicted of a subsequent sex offense under a second case number have committed more than one sex crime, and the General Assembly could have concluded that those individuals are more likely to reoffend; and the underinclusiveness of a particular provision does not make the provision unconstitutional.

       Police officer engaged in racial profiling prohibited by state statute, the state constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and the city's written policy and the officer also illegally seized one of the plaintiffs, thereby violating U.S. Const., Amend. IV and the state constitution; the police chief, who supervised the officer and ran the police department, was deliberately indifferent to ongoing and systemic racial profiling of which he was aware and municipal liability was imposed on the city as it permitted the officer to establish and to carry out a custom and practice of engaging in racial profiling. The officer's true objective was not to enforce traffic laws prohibiting people from driving with their vision obstructed or other minor infractions; rather, the neutral traffic laws were used as a pretext for harassing Hispanics (whether here legally or illegally), for obtaining money through fines and towing charges for the financially troubled city, and to provide an incentive for Hispanics to move out of the area—clearly illegitimate objectives.

       Order of court requiring association to produce records listing the names and addresses of officers and employees and records, files, papers, correspondence, deposit slips, canceled checks and reports, but did not require a production of the membership lists, was not void because the membership lists were privileged under the provisions of the constitution.

       Numerous instances have arisen wherein attorneys are appointed to represent indigent prisoners and the attorney has been embarrassed by seeing his name in print relative to the defense made, though no wrongful act had been committed by the attorney, but under our system of government and its democratic processes, a free press is assured, and a conditional privilege is accorded to newspaper reports of judicial proceedings.

       This section prevents the General Assembly from giving the Claims Commission exclusive jurisdiction of tort claims against state employees or officers for their unlawful acts. Grimmett v. Digby, 267 Ark. 192, 589 S.W.2d 579 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional right to trial by jury does not secure the right in all possible instances but only in those cases in which it existed when the constitution was framed; it extends only to the trial of issues of fact in civil and criminal causes. Jones v. Reed, 267 Ark. 237, 590 S.W.2d 6 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional right to trial by jury does not secure the right in all possible instances but only in those cases that were so triable at common law. Dunn v. Davis, 291 Ark. 492, 725 S.W.2d 853 (1987); McClanahan v. Gibson, 296 Ark. 304, 756 S.W.2d 889 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       After the enactment of Ark. Const. Amend. 80, the clean-up doctrine was abolished in Arkansas. Instead, in deciding whether a claim should be submitted to a judge as an equitable matter or to a jury as a legal matter, a circuit court must review the historical nature of the claim and consider the
   remedies sought. Tilley v. Malvern Nat'l Bank, 2017 Ark. 343,

       The right to a jury trial set out in Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 7 is unaffected by Ark. Const. Amend. 80, as section 7 does not assure the right to a jury trial in all possible instances, but rather in those cases where the right to a jury trial existed when the constitution was framed; further, the right to a jury trial does not apply to new rights created by the legislature since the adoption of the Arkansas Constitution.

      </p>

       The Unemployment Compensation Act providing for court review and the method of appeal is not violative of the constitutional provision for trial by jury. McKinley v. R.L. Payne & Son Lumber Co., 200 Ark. 1114, 143 S.W.2d 38 (1940).

       The circuit court erred in submitting the city civil service commission's order demoting police chief to a jury over appellant's objection. Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Matlock, 205 Ark. 286, 168 S.W.2d 424 (1943).

       Because defendant failed to file a certified record of the district court proceedings on his driving while intoxicated trial with the circuit court clerk within 30 days of the district court judgment, as required by Ark. R. Crim. P. 36(b), the circuit court had no jurisdiction over his appeal, even though defendant's right to jury trial was thereby lost.

Henry, Walden & Davis v. Goodman, 294 Ark. 25, 741 S.W.2d 233 (1987), superseded by statute as stated in, Salmon v. Atkinson, 355 Ark. 325, 137 S.W.3d 383 (2003).

       The prosecutor's expressions, characterizing defendant as a mad dog, an escape risk, a threat to the jurors' safety if the death sentence was not imposed, and implying that a life sentence, in effect, would require taxpayers to underwrite huge costs and would constitute an improper compromise and violation of the jurors' oath, implicated defendant's Eighth Amendment right by not only minimizing the jury's duty and responsibility, but injecting irrelevant factors into the jury's decision-making responsibility. Miller v. Lockhart, 861 F. Supp. 1425 (E.D. Ark. 1994), aff'd, 65 F.3d 676 (8th Cir. 1995).

       Where plaintiff in action on promissory note moved for directed verdict and court denied the motion, whereupon defendant also moved for a directed verdict, the trial court erred in taking the case away from the jury and deciding it in favor of plaintiff.

       Where motion to dismiss appeal, treated as certiorari, brought up the original verdict signed by nine of the jurors, judgment was affirmed though judgment as presented by appellant, copied in the face of the judgment, showed that it was signed by only eight jurors.

       It is not error on a charge of manslaughter to be tried by a jury of eleven men where appellant not only agreed in open court to a jury of eleven, but made no objections, saved no exceptions, and did not assign this as error in his motion for a new trial. Ford v. State, 222 Ark. 16, 257 S.W.2d 30 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a case was submitted to the jury on interrogatories and the answer to one was signed by eight jurors and one other as “foreman,” the word “foreman” following the signature of such party was mere surplusage and the foreman would not be required to sign again on the assumption that he had signed merely as foreman; the answer was therefore signed by necessary nine jurors. Sullivan v. Fanestiel, 229 Ark. 662, 317 S.W.2d 713 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer to each interrogatory in special verdicts is to be considered as a separate verdict on that particular issue of fact, and where as many as any nine of the jurors agree upon the finding as to the particular fact in issue, such agreement constitutes the verdict of the jury on such issue.

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial was appropriate because he invited the alleged error. If he had not agreed to start his trial without alternate jurors, then the circuit court could have seated some when the trial began; defendant had to have known that his second cousin had been seated as a juror and yet he let the matter go until she was dismissed.

       The use of the words “sentencing court” in an act was intended to refer either to the judge or the jury, and the factual issue of the use of a firearm is to be determined by the jury unless a jury has been waived; therefore, the section does not contravene the constitutional right to a trial by jury.

       The Constitution expresses the only manner in which the right to a jury trial can be lost, that is, by waiver, and waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right; therefore, the constitutional right to a jury trial cannot be lost by forfeiture, it can only be waived.

       Defendant's failure to respond to a notice of trial setting, which advised that the court was to be notified 48 hours in advance if a jury trial was requested, did not constitute a waiver of a jury trial. Reaser v. State, 47 Ark. App. 7, 883 S.W.2d 851 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       When construing this section together with Ark. R. Crim. P. 31.2, the law is clear that the only way a defendant may waive the jury trial right is by personally making an express declaration in writing or in open court and that the record of open court proceedings where the defendant waives his or her right must be preserved. Hill v. State, 47 Ark. App. 44, 883 S.W.2d 857 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver of jury trial in judge's chambers satisfied the “open court” requirement of Ark. R. Crim. P. 31.2 where defendant requested a hearing in the judge's chambers because defendant did not want the jury panel to overhear, and thus be prejudiced by, defendant's statements regarding his reluctance to have his case tried to a jury; once in chambers, defendant made it absolutely clear that he wished to have his case tried to the circuit judge and not the jury because he feared a jury would “automatically” conclude he was guilty and “railroad” him, and, after the trial court admonished defendant that he was “giving up one of the most precious rights that anybody has in this country,” defendant concluded that he wanted to take his chances with the trial judge. Burton v. State, 327 Ark. 65, 937 S.W.2d 634 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not waive her right to a jury trial by signing an “Acknowledgment” document in which defendant stated that she had been advised by counsel that it would be in her best interest to accept the plea bargain agreement, but had declined to do so, and that she wished to go forward with her right to a bench trial; the “Acknowledgment” was obviously not prepared for the express purpose of waiving a jury trial and contained too casual a reference to constitute an express, knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of such a fundamental and important constitutional right. McCoy v. State, 60 Ark. App. 306, 962 S.W.2d 822 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was no evidence that defendant was informed by the court of his right to be tried by a jury or that he executed a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his rights, defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to a trial by jury. Davis v. State, 81 Ark. App. 17, 97 S.W.3d 921 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a felony non-support case, where counsel requested a jury trial at the pretrial hearing but the case proceeded as a bench trial, the appellate court held that defendant was denied his right to a jury trial as the record was silent as to whether defendant had knowingly, intelligently, and understandingly waived his right to a jury trial. Burrell v. State, 90 Ark. App. 114, 204 S.W.3d 80 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of defendant's appeal of his conviction in the city court was improper as the dismissal would waive defendant's right to a jury trial, which he did not waive; defendant neither personally made an express declaration in writing or in open court, nor did counsel make the waiver in open court in the presence of the defendant. Ayala v. State, 365 Ark. 192, 226 S.W.3d 766 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's standard practice of requiring a defendant to request a jury at least 48 hours before trial was not in accordance with the Arkansas Constitution or the Arkansas Rules of Criminal Procedure; the notice requirement put a defendant in the position of forfeiting his or her right to a jury trial due to inaction.
   Swindle v. State, 373 Ark. 519, 285 S.W.3d 200 (2008), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">556 U.S. 1127</cite>, <cite class="s_court">129 S. Ct. 1616</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">173 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 994 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in finding that defendant had waived his right to a jury trial where there was no specific acknowledgement by defendant that he understood the right that was waived by his attorney and no indication in the record that the trial court made any attempt to ensure that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived the right.
   Guana-Lopez v. State, 2014 Ark. App. 204 (2014).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Predispute contractual jury waivers are unenforceable under the Arkansas Constitution.
   The right to a jury trial is a fundamental, constitutional right that is protected by the Arkansas Constitution, and a jury trial cannot be waived before litigation begins. Tilley v. Malvern Nat'l Bank, 2017 Ark. 343,
   532 S.W.3d 570 (2017).

      </h4>
      <p>
       It was not an abuse of discretion by the court to refuse on the day of trial to permit the withdrawal of a waiver of jury trial made some six months before. Scates v. State, 244 Ark. 333, 424 S.W.2d 876 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's request to withdraw his waiver of his right to be tried by a jury under the United States and Arkansas Constitutions because the trial court apparently did not consider anything other than the fact that defendant had already waived his right to a jury trial; neither the trial court's order nor its oral explanation from a subsequent pretrial hearing mentioned timeliness, delay, or inconvenience. The motion to withdraw was filed less than 2 weeks after defendant's waiver, almost a month before a scheduled bench trial, and over 2 months from the date that the trial actually occurred.
   McCall v. State, 2016 Ark. App. 300, 495 S.W.3d 91 (2016).

     </h3>
     <p>
      No person shall be held to answer a criminal charge unless on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases of impeachment or cases such as the General Assembly shall make cognizable by justices of the peace, and courts of similar jurisdiction; or cases arising in the army and navy of the United States; or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; and no person, for the same offense, shall be twice put in jeopardy of life or liberty; but if, in any criminal prosecution, the jury be divided in opinion, the court before which the trial shall be had, may, in its discretion, discharge the jury, and commit or bail the accused for trial, at the same or the next term of said court; nor shall any person be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law. All persons shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for capital offenses, when the proof is evident or the presumption great.

       Determination on application for bail will not be disturbed unless trial court abused its discretion. Fikes v. State, 221 Ark. 81, 251 S.W.2d 1014 (1952).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The offense of accessory before the fact to murder is a capital offense and is not bailable where the proof is evident or the presumption great. State ex rel. Att'y Gen. v. Williams, 97 Ark. 243, 133 S.W. 1017 (1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court will not disturb an order denying bail in a capital case unless there has been an abuse of discretion or the trial court appears to have acted arbitrarily. Parnell v. State, 206 Ark. 652, 176 S.W.2d 902 (1942); Green v. State, 52 Ark. App. 244, 917 S.W.2d 171 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no invidious discrimination where capital offender was held without bail for a valid state purpose and no discrimination was shown against a category of persons. Smith v. State, 256 Ark. 425, 508 S.W.2d 54 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a capital case, the state must assume the burden of proving that bail should be denied because the proof is evident or the presumption great. Renton v. State, 265 Ark. 223, 577 S.W.2d 594 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the prior conviction of defendant for a capital offense would satisfy the requirement of this section that the “proof is evident” or that the “presumption is great,” court's order granting a stay pending appeal did not deprive defendant of any legally compelling cognizable right to be released on bail pending a new trial. Grigsby v. Mabry, 583 F. Supp. 629 (E.D. Ark. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       A charge of capital murder does not automatically obviate the possibility of the accused being freed on bond. Buchanan v. State, 315 Ark. 227, 866 S.W.2d 395 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state bears the burden of showing “the proof is evident or the presumption great,” and the mere fact that capital murder has been charged does not mean the offense is non-bailable. Buchanan v. State, 315 Ark. 227, 866 S.W.2d 395 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of bond upheld in capital case.

       <b>
        —Cash-Only Bail.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In view of mandate that money bail should be used only as a last resort to ensure the court appearance of an accused, the circuit court erred in refusing to require the municipal court to make a determination that no other condition would ensure accused's court appearance before setting money bail. Thomas v. State, 260 Ark. 512, 542 S.W.2d 284 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of bail in Arkansas is to ensure the presence of the defendant, and cash-only bail does not restrict a defendant's constitutional rights pending trial.
   Trujillo v. State, 2016 Ark. 49, 483 S.W.3d 801 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the plain language of the Arkansas Constitution and the purpose of bail, the term “sufficient sureties” in this section refers to a broad range of methods to accomplish sufficient sureties, including cash. Accordingly, the Arkansas Constitution permits cash-only bail, as determined by the circuit court pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 9.2, and is subject to the constitutional protections of this section.
   Trujillo v. State, 2016 Ark. 49, 483 S.W.3d 801 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in setting a cash-only bail for a defendant charged with two counts of aggravated assault, one count of second-degree domestic battery, one count of third-degree domestic battery, and enhanced penalty for an offense committed in the presence of children.
   Trujillo v. State, 2016 Ark. 49, 483 S.W.3d 801 (2016).

        —Insanity.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       It was reversible error for a trial court hearing a motion for a new trial to tell the defendant that, if she took the stand to testify as to her insanity, it would immediately send her to the state hospital and not consider bail in the absence of evidence she was a menace to anyone. Kozal v. State, 264 Ark. 587, 573 S.W.2d 323 (1978).

      </h4>
      <p>
       A rule permitting the trial court to revoke bail upon a finding of reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has committed a felony while released pending adjudication of a prior charge would not preclude the trial court from setting a new and reasonable bail with appropriate terms and restrictions. Reeves v. State, 261 Ark. 384, 548 S.W.2d 822 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section confers an absolute right before conviction, except in capital cases, to a reasonable bail. Duncan v. State, 308 Ark. 205, 823 S.W.2d 886 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A deferred guilty plea to a felony may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount and conditions of bail; however, the defendant cannot be denied release on bail as a matter of law because of the plea. Duncan v. State, 308 Ark. 205, 823 S.W.2d 886 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a mental examination provided a basis for setting stringent conditions on release of defendant charged with attempted murder and aggravated assault, it did not give the judge the option of refusing to release him from incarceration. Henley v. Taylor, 324 Ark. 114, 918 S.W.2d 713, 922 S.W.2d 681 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner was awarded certiorari relief after a trial court denied petitioner bail after petitioner was charged with violating an order of protection because petitioner was not charged with a capital offense; the trial court should have set a reasonable bail with whatever terms and restrictions were deemed appropriate.
   Hobbs v. Reynolds, 375 Ark. 313, 289 S.W.3d 917 (2008).

       If the district court finds a defendant has failed to make a colorable showing of previous jeopardy and threat of repeated jeopardy, the filing of a notice of appeal from the denial of the double jeopardy motion does not divest the district court of jurisdiction. United States v. Brown, 926 F.2d 779 (8th Cir. 1991).

       A conviction of an aggravated assault is a bar to an indictment for assault with intent to kill for the same offense since both crimes put the defendant in jeopardy of life or liberty. State v. Smith, 53 Ark. 24, 13 S.W. 391 (1890).

       Where the prosecutor's reference to the fact that the defendant had been drinking was indirect and brief, the state did not use the defendant's conduct of operating a motor vehicle in an intoxicated condition to prove the assault charge; therefore, the state did not establish an essential element of the assault offense by proving conduct constituting an offense for which the defendant had already been prosecuted and the defendant was not placed in double jeopardy.

       When the jury is finally sworn to try the case, jeopardy has attached to the accused, and when, without the consent of the defendant, expressed or implied, the jury is discharged before the case is completed, then the constitutional right against double jeopardy may be invoked, except in cases of overruling necessity.

       Since a jury was never sworn to hear defendant's case, double jeopardy did not attach and the trial court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss the charge on such grounds. Smith v. State, 307 Ark. 542, 821 S.W.2d 774 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The manifest necessity permitting the discharge of a jury without rendering a verdict and without justifying a plea of double jeopardy may arise from various causes or circumstances; however, the circumstances must be forceful and compelling, and must be in the nature of a cause or emergency over which neither court nor attorney has control or which could not have been averted by diligence and care.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that, as a result of defense counsel bringing a live explosive into court without permission, there was an overruling necessity for terminating the trial and therefore the Double Jeopardy Clause did not preclude the state from bringing defendant to trial a second time. There was a concern that members of the jury, who had been evacuated from the courthouse, observed police officers in handling the explosive.

      <p>
       The Fifth Amendment's and this section's double jeopardy clauses did not bar defendant's retrial on capital-murder and first-degree murder charges because, although the jury forewoman announced in open court that the jury had found defendant not guilty on those charges, the jury had deadlocked on a manslaughter charge, a mistrial was declared, and there were no “findings” or “verdicts”; a trial court's declaration of a mistrial because of a hung jury was not an event that terminated the original jeopardy to which defendant was subjected, and the mere reading of the jury's verdict in open court did not constitute an acquittal. Neither the giving of the transitional instruction nor the forewoman's announcement negated the bedrock principle that a judgment was not valid until entered of record.

      <p>
       Denial of defendant's motions to bar his retrial on the charge of first-degree murder was proper because his trial ended in a mistrial without a final verdict entered in the record, and there was no actual verdict of acquittal. Neither the transitional jury instruction nor the jury's written status report of the vote on the lesser-included charge negated the requirements for a formal verdict and there was no merit to defendant's arguments that the jury's note reflecting its vote on the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder constituted an implicit acquittal on the charge of first-degree murder, and that entry of the jury's note into the record rendered it controlling for the purpose of jeopardy on first-degree murder.

       In a case where defendant and his son were tried together, because defendant expressly requested the trial court to grant a mistrial, that request obviated the need to demonstrate an overruling necessity in order to avoid a claim of double jeopardy, and the state constitutional double jeopardy provision did not impose an affirmative duty on the trial court to determine if the jury was divided on defendant's guilt or innocence.

       Circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss his charges based on double-jeopardy grounds because the record did not support that a mistrial was to the State's advantage. The trial did not appear to be going badly for the State because the victim had already testified to the sexual abuse, and her testimony alone was sufficient to sustain a conviction; there was testimony that defendant's DNA matched the semen found on the victim's comforter; and, other than defendant's assertion otherwise, defendant failed to give any reason for the State to want a mistrial, and there was no indication that the State intentionally goaded defendant into requesting one.

       Circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss his charges based on double-jeopardy grounds after a mistrial was granted due to the State's publication of defendant's excluded booking photograph during the trial.

       Defendant's motion to dismiss the charges against him based on double jeopardy grounds was properly denied as the trial court did not intend, by its conduct, to provoke defendant into moving for a mistrial, and defendant was not goaded into requesting a mistrial. Defendant's right to proceed pro se was revoked when he could not follow the rules of the court and continued to be disruptive both in front of and outside of the presence of the jury; his attorney asked for a mistrial as he did not feel that he could adequately defend defendant at that stage of the trial; the trial court explained that the mistrial would be without any conditions; and defendant welcomed a mistrial.

       Defendant's retrial did not violate double jeopardy because the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in sua sponte declaring a mistrial due to an overruling necessity, based on (1) a number of circumstances outside the control of the court and the State, including the unexpected unavailability of an interpreter for a second day of trial and a full docket the rest of the week, and (2) the court's efforts to try to complete the trial in one day.

       The double jeopardy clause does not prevent the government from retrying a defendant who succeeds in getting his first conviction set aside, through direct appeal or collateral attack, because of some error in the proceedings leading to conviction; however, the important exception to this rule is that retrial is barred if a conviction is reversed because the evidence was legally insufficient, because reversal on that ground is equivalent, for double jeopardy purposes, to a verdict of acquittal.

       Former section 7J of the Procedures of the Arkansas Supreme Court Regulating Professional Conduct of Attorneys at Law does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article 2, § 8, of the Arkansas Constitution, notwithstanding the argument that it took away an attorney' right to liberty and property without due process of law, as the practice of law is a privilege, rather than a property right, and the court's right to control the practice of law was, in and of itself, substantial reason to effectuate his suspension.

       It is fundamentally unfair to revoke probation on the basis of a violation not mentioned in the revocation petition because a defendant cannot properly prepare for the hearing without knowing in advance what charges of misconduct are to be investigated as a basis for the proposed revocation of the probation.

       Imposition of consecutive sentences was not in violation of defendant's due process rights or the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution where the trial judge noted that the sentences imposed on each count were less than the maximum and that the approach was consistent with other jury sentences in the country; the trial judge clearly exercised discretion in accepting the jury's recommendation.

       Defendant's due process rights were not violated where the trial court was not attempting to enlarge a criminal statute and was not changing, amending, or modifying defendant's sentence; it was simply vacating the plea agreement that was entered into between defendant and the state because defendant breached the agreement, and defendant had fair warning that he had to cooperate with the state.

       In a case seeking the revocation of a suspended sentence, defendant failed to show that there was a due process violation because he was present at a hearing, was provided the opportunity to hear and controvert evidence against him at the hearing, was provided the opportunity to offer evidence in his own defense, and was represented by counsel. Moreover, defendant failed to show that there was any prejudice, which was required for a reversal.

       Summary judgment was appropriate because there was no dispute that notice to the landowner of the pending tax sale was a single unclaimed letter sent by certified mail; some additional step reasonably calculated to give the landowner notice was required, and a mailing to the other landowners did not satisfy the requirements of due process.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statute defining first-degree battery is not unconstitutionally vague since it provides sufficient notice of the conduct proscribed and is not defective in not setting out the necessary culpable mental state since statute defining culpable mental states clearly provides that such mental state must be proved.

       The allegation that statute did not proscribe the act of fellatio was without merit and the statute was held not to be unconstitutionally vague or too broad in scope. Connor v.

       Where standards for termination of parental rights are the subject of the statute involved, the application of “vagueness” tests should lie somewhere between that given criminal law statutes and that given statutes regulating business, i.e., permitting greater flexibility than where criminal law statutes are involved and less flexibility than with business-regulatory statutes.

       Since the prohibitions set forth in the Sunday closing law were vague and did not satisfy the basic principle that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be prohibited, such law fails to meet the minimal requirements of due process.

       Statute setting the standard for driving while under the influence is not void for vagueness and meets both due process requirements in that it gives a fair warning of the prohibited conduct and a clear standard is set for police enforcement. Lovell v. State, 283 Ark. 425, 678 S.W.2d 318 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process requires a statute to be definite enough to provide (1) a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed and (2) a standard for police enforcement and for ascertainment of guilt; however, the Constitution does not require impossible standards of specificity and a statute is sufficiently clear if its language conveys sufficient warning when measured by common understanding and practice.

       Due process requires only fair warning, not actual notice; the statutory definition of “intoxicated” fairly warns a person of ordinary intelligence that he is in jeopardy of violating the law if he drives a motor vehicle after consuming a sufficient quantity of alcohol to alter his reactions, motor skills and judgment, to the extent that his driving constitutes a substantial danger to himself or others.

      <p>
       When a defendant invokes his Sixth Amendment right to counsel for a judicial proceeding unrelated to the present charge, but does not make any indication that he only wishes to deal with the police through counsel, he does not invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel; the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is case specific. Olive v. State, 340 Ark. 343, 10 S.W.3d 443 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       An accused's right to counsel after a prosecution has commenced is case specific and cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions; therefore, defendant's invocation of his right to counsel in the robbery case did not constitute an invocation of the right to counsel during his subsequent custodial interrogation regarding the murder. Olive v. State, 340 Ark. 343, 10 S.W.3d 443 (2000).
      </p>

       Defendant's statement was spontaneous and not the product of custodial interrogation; the mere fact that the officer sat silently in the interview room with defendant for a brief period of time while he looked over his case file was not the sort of coercive police practice or psychological ploy that Miranda was designed to guard against, nor was the officer's request for handwriting samples because such evidence, which was sought only for comparison purposes, was not testimonial in nature and therefore not protected.

       Defendant's convictions and sentences for capital murder and kidnapping were inappropriate because counsel was not made available to defendant, nor did defendant initiate contact. The illegal statement was made at 7:25 p.m. and concluded at 7:35 p.m., and the subsequent confession was taken at 8:55 p.m.; defendant was in no way free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having had confessed and he was in continuous custody between the two statements and the same investigators participated in both.

       None of defendant's statements unambiguously and unequivocally indicated defendant's right to remain silent or a right to counsel; defendant was conscious of his Miranda rights and he continued to talk to the officer and answer his questions even though he knew it was against his best interest, and there was no error in allowing the indicated portions of the custodial statement.

       Sex Offender Screening and Risk Assessment Committee's use of statements the sex offender made during the assessment process, under a grant of immunity, to assess him as a level four offender, did not violate his privilege against self-incrimination under this section.

       A voluntary confession by one of two participants in a bank robbery under an oath administered by the prosecuting attorney is admissible in a prosecution of the confessor alone, as not violating self-incrimination, where the confessor is warned that he need not confess and that it will be used against him.

       A threat is not more odious per se than a promise; the real issue concerning incriminating statements made through hope or fear is based on broader considerations of voluntariness in light of the particular inducement, whatever its nature. Leach v. State, 311 Ark. 485, 845 S.W.2d 11 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court will examine all of the circumstances to determine whether a statement was voluntary; if a promise or threat was made, the court will look first to the police conduct and then to the vulnerability of the defendant. Leach v. State, 311 Ark. 485, 845 S.W.2d 11 (1993).

       If a promise was made that was permissible and was kept, those are circumstances to consider in determining whether a confession was voluntary. Leach v. State, 311 Ark. 485, 845 S.W.2d 11 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge's determination that confession was voluntary was correct where there was no evidence of offer of reward or leniency, where defendant was almost 18 years of age when his confession was made, he was advised of his rights on three occasions, and any psychological tactic used by police did not overbear his free will.

       The motion to suppress the Miranda-warned confession because it was tainted by the first unwarned questioning was denied where there were none of the characteristics of the coercive atmosphere found in Shelton v.

       Where an officer was called to a disturbance at defendant's home, the officer's general question to defendant who had been hiding in the woods of “What's up?” was a general term of salutation and was not designed to elicit an incriminating response; thus, defendant's incriminating statements regarding incest, made in reply to the responding officer's salutation, were admissible. Arnett v. State, 353 Ark. 165, 122 S.W.3d 484 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a sexual abuse case, the court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress his confession where it was voluntarily made and he offered no evidence to establish a nexus between the conduct of the police and his statement, nor anything that would have proven a link between “coercive activity of the State” and his resulting confession; defendant did not claim that he confessed because the police directed someone to beat him up in his cell the night before he gave his statement, nor did he allege any kind of actual police coercion of any sort but, instead, simply argued that the officer knew that people charged with crimes against children were treated badly. Standridge v. State, 357 Ark. 105, 161 S.W.3d 815 (2004).

      <p>
       In defendant's rape case, the court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress his confession where defendant was informed of his Miranda rights, he signed a statement-of-rights form, and the officer did not make any threats or promises in exchange for the confession.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in allowing defendant's confession to capital murder as the police had properly advised defendant of his Miranda rights, and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation by the police revealed both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension by defendant.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's confession was voluntary because the only evidence of police misconduct was defendant's self-serving testimony; an officer testified that he did nothing to induce the confession, and neither he nor another officer told defendant that they would keep defendant from going to jail.
   Bell v. State, 371 Ark. 375, 266 S.W.3d 696 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's confession was voluntary because there was no evidence of threats on the videotaped portion of defendant's statement or any physical evidence of force being used on defendant, defendant was 34 years old, there was no indication that he had a below-normal intelligence, and the statement was taken within a few hours after defendant's arrest and after only a short period of interrogation.

       There is no constitutional right to recordation of all phases of police interrogation leading to a confession under the Due Process Clause of this section. No Arkansas law requires the police to record an interrogation in its totality, and while an appellate court reviewing the voluntary nature of a confession will consider the absence of a recording as a factor in the totality of the circumstances mix, the court will not invalidate a confession for that reason alone.

      <p>
       Confession given in a murder case was not suppressed; defendant was an adult with a high-school equivalency education, he was coherent, and he was in fair physical condition.

       Court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress his statement because, after being advised of his Miranda rights, defendant stated that he would not answer any questions because “there's nothing for him to say because the police already had his weed.” There was no evidence that the officer's initial failure to advise defendant of his Miranda rights on the roadside was purposeful or part of an interrogation-first tactic.

       Where, in a prosecution for capital murder, the defendant voluntarily gave a confession after being advised of his rights and given an opportunity to engage an attorney, he knowingly and intelligently waived his right against self-incrimination. Rodgers v. State, 261 Ark. 293, 547 S.W.2d 419 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the police failed to follow counsel's instructions to stop questioning or to inform the suspect of counsel's efforts to reach him, their actions did not affect the validity of an otherwise proper waiver of defendant's right against self-incrimination. Mitchell v. State, 306 Ark. 464, 816 S.W.2d 566 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's confusion as to whether unrecorded comments to police officers could be used against him did not invalidate a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent. Bogard v. State, 311 Ark. 412, 844 S.W.2d 347 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the trial court had concluded that the appellant waived her privilege against self-incrimination, the burden was on the appellant, on appeal, to demonstrate any error on the part of the trial court in finding there was a waiver. Young v. Young, 316 Ark. 456, 872 S.W.2d 856 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether an accused had sufficient mental capacity to waive his constitutional rights, or was too incapacitated due to drugs or alcohol to make an intelligent waiver, is a question of fact for the trial court to resolve. The fact that the accused might have been intoxicated at the time of his statement, alone, will not invalidate that statement, but will only go to the weight accorded it. Kemp v. State, 324 Ark. 178, 919 S.W.2d 943, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 982</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 436</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 334 (1996).

       The court looked at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation and determined that the state proved that the defendant had the requisite level of comprehension to knowingly waive his rights. Steggall v. State, 340 Ark. 184, 8 S.W.3d 538 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights where he verbally indicated that he understood them, he initialed each of his responses and signed the waiver, and defendant appeared to be alert and responsive and did not seem to have any problem understanding his rights as they were explained to him. Flowers v. State, 362 Ark. 193, 208 S.W.3d 113 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court did not err in concluding that a juvenile defendant with an IQ of 68 voluntarily signed the Miranda waiver form where he was carefully explained his rights, the process was free from coercion, and defendant did so with full awareness of the nature of the rights being waived and the consequences of the decision to abandon them. Otis v. State, 364 Ark. 151, 217 S.W.3d 839 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where (1) detective spoke with defendant in an interview room and said he would like to speak with defendant regarding the case, (2) defendant invoked his right to remain silent and his right to counsel, (3) the detective then proceeded to question defendant only regarding a criminal investigation division (CID) information form, and (4) defendant spontaneously indicated that he wanted to talk and was then given his Miranda rights, there was no evidence of coercion and it was clear that defendant was aware of the consequences of abandoning his right to remain silent and to have counsel present during questioning; thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his custodial statement. Marshall v. State, 92 Ark. App. 188, 211 S.W.3d 597 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's statement to police was voluntary because his statement, “you'll furnish me a public defender,” was an equivocal request for counsel, made in the middle of the officer's recitation of the rights on the Miranda form, signifying that defendant was merely repeating what the officer had just told him; further, defendant indicated that he understood his rights and he signed the waiver of rights form.

Williams v. Ark. Dep't of Corr., 362 Ark. 134, 207 S.W.3d 519, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">546 U.S. 1018</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S. Ct. 647</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">163 L.

Amend. VIII and the Arkansas Constitution: (1) the warden had investigated the grievances that were filed against two corrections officers arising from their alleged mistreatment of prisoners, he had found that they were typical of grievances that were generally filed against corrections officers, and he had taken disciplinary action against the offending officer with regard to the one grievance that he found was substantiated; (2) the officers'
   employment records did not give the warden cause to believe that they presented a substantial risk to the safety of prisoners; and (3) the district court's disagreement with the warden's disciplinary choices, specifically the warden's failure to require the offending officer to participate in a remedial program in addition to the one-week suspension, temporary job reassignment, and reprimand that he received, was not sufficient to support the deliberate indifference finding.

       The cumulative effect of consecutive sentences does not make punishment cruel and unusual; accordingly, where defendant was found guilty by a jury which imposed the maximum penalty and the trial court exercised its discretion in ordering the sentences to be served consecutively, the cumulative sentence of 160 years imprisonment and $160,000 fine was not barbarous, outside the law, or wholly disproportionate to the nature of the offense charged.

       Imposition of consecutive sentences was not in violation of defendant's due process rights or the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution where the trial judge noted that the sentences imposed on each count were less than the maximum and that the approach was consistent with other jury sentences in the country; the trial judge clearly exercised discretion in accepting the jury's recommendation.

       In challenging a method of execution under Ark.

      <p>
       The purpose of this section is to expedite adjudications so that none can fairly say that the right to acquittal was stifled because those charged with official duty preferred to procrastinate. Maxwell v. State, 216 Ark. 393, 225 S.W.2d 687 (1950), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">343 U.S. 929</cite>, <cite class="s_court">72 S. Ct. 758</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">96 L.

      <p>
       Defendant's due process rights were not violated by trial court's decision to refuse to allow the introduction of a mistake-of-age defense in a rape trial because the legislature had the authority to define crimes and defenses; moreover, there were exceptions to the rule that every crime was required to contain a mens rea element. Gaines v. State, 354 Ark. 89, 118 S.W.3d 102 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant claimed that he was denied the ability to present evidence of the context in which the sexual abuse allegations were made and thus was unable to adduce significant evidence of the victim's true motive, defendant elicited testimony during the trial from the victim as to another possible motive for accusing defendant; thus, it was not that defendant was not allowed to present a defense, but rather that he was not allowed to present the defense he wanted due to the exclusion of the victim's prior sexual conduct, which was proper under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c42s16-42-101" target="_blank">16-42-101</a></cite>.
   Jackson v. State, 368 Ark. 610, 249 S.W.3d 127, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">552 U.S. 850</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 112</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">169 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 79 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not show a deprivation of his constitutional right to present a defense; the constitution permits the exclusion of evidence that is repetitive, only marginally relevant, or poses an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues, and evidence of third-party guilt that is irrelevant, or which is relevant but substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or confusion because it is not sufficiently linked to the crime in question, is prohibited.

        Appellate Review.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Appellate counsel filed the notice of appeal four days after the judgment and, therefore, could have timely raised ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion for a new trial; defendant's argument, that the appellate court should have addressed claims of ineffective assistance first raised on direct appeal where it was apparent from the face of the record that an appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel and there was no possibility that the ineffectiveness was due to trial strategy, was without merit. Ratchford v. State, 357 Ark. 27, 159 S.W.3d 304 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant complained on appeal about an alleged conflict of interest involving his attorney, but the court's research had not revealed a single case where the court considered an ineffective assistance conflict of interest argument on direct appeal in the absence of a proper objection in the trial court; because defendant failed to raise his argument in the trial court, the court held that he failed to preserve this issue for review, and defendant himself had conceded that it could have been that the resolution of the matter was to occur in a proceeding under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37, as many of the relevant decisions on the point came in postconviction proceedings.

       A copy of an indictment duly served is not invalidated by the mere omission, through clerical error, of the defendant's name in one place. Allison v. State, 74 Ark. 444, 86 S.W. 409 (1905).

       The statute which regulates the contents of an indictment does not violate the constitutional provision that the accused shall enjoy the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. Smith v. State, 231 Ark. 235, 330 S.W.2d 58 (1959).

       To ensure the right of a defendant to know the accusation against him, an indictment should (1) inform defendant that he is called upon to answer, (2) inform the court of a definite offense, and (3) protect defendant against a further prosecution. State v. Cadle, 19 Ark. 613 (1858) (decision under prior Constitution).

       Although it is better and safer practice to include in an information or indictment the date on which or the time frame in which an offense occurred, it is not necessarily fatal to an indictment or information if such data is not included, unless time is an essential element of the offense.

Amend. 5, 6, and 14 and met the notice requirements of Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 8 and this section; while there may well have been irregularities in the form of the instrument, they were the sort of irregularities that were waived if not raised. Hagen v.

       State excused a juror because the juror worshipped with a reverend who was a witness for defendant, plus the state worried that the juror would have given the reverend more credibility because of the close ties that he had to the juror's mother; the trial court found this to be a sufficient race-neutral explanation and the court agreed.

       Where jurors publicly expressed opinions indicating great prejudice against defendant with a definite opinion as to defendant's guilt, but denied such prejudice in qualifying as jurors, defendant is entitled to a new trial. Anderson v. State, 200 Ark. 516, 139 S.W.2d 396 (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for assault, a remark by the prosecutor that the defendant could sell enough whiskey to pay a fine if imposed is highly prejudicial to defendant's right to an impartial jury trial where there was no evidence connecting the defendant with drinking or the sale of intoxicating liquor. Todd v. State, 202 Ark. 287, 150 S.W.2d 46 (1941).

      <p>
       Jurors who had formed opinions concerning the guilt or innocence of the defendant and who, while willing to alter such opinions upon hearing evidence to the contrary, declared they would retain such opinions until they heard such evidence prevented the jury from being a fair and impartial jury within the meaning of this section. Glover v. State, 248 Ark. 1260, 455 S.W.2d 670 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a juror acknowledged during voir dire that his nephew was a drug undercover agent and that he had talked with the nephew about his experiences, the juror's presumptive bias, even after court interrogation, was sufficient to require his exclusion from the trial of defendant for sale and delivery of a controlled substance. Pickens v. State, 260 Ark. 633, 542 S.W.2d 764 (1976).
      </p>

       Although the brother of a prospective juror, who was a police officer, did not testify, considering the role of this officer with reference to the initiation of the investigation, the search and the identification procedure, he could not be eliminated as one on whose complaint the prosecution was instituted, nor were prospective juror's answers on voir dire sufficient to eliminate him as one who was prevented by a relationship or by circumstances from acting impartially; hence, failure to sustain the challenge to this juror for cause was prejudicial error.

       Despite the constitutional right to be present at one's criminal prosecution, that right may, under certain circumstances be waived by a defendant's belligerent or disruptive behavior; defendant was properly prevented from being present at his trial where he repeatedly used grossly inappropriate language and profanity toward the trial judge during the pretrial hearing, and where the judge gave the defendant a chance to display proper courtroom decorum before the trial began.

      </p>
      <p>
       While a trial judge is not a mere umpire and may interrogate witnesses in an action before him, he may not act in a dual capacity as judge and advocate; the presentation of a litigant's case in an adversary proceeding should be left to the initiative of counsel who has the responsibility to represent the interest of his client. Oliver v. State, 268 Ark. 579, 594 S.W.2d 261 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>

       Prior convictions may not be considered for purposes of the sentencing enhancement for subsequent convictions for driving while intoxicated unless the records shows the accused had counsel in the trials leading to the prior convictions or that the right to counsel was waived. Southern v. State, 284 Ark. 572, 683 S.W.2d 933 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section specifically provides that an accused in a criminal prosecution shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and his counsel and no sentence involving loss of liberty can be imposed where there has been a denial of counsel; furthermore, an accused is entitled to relief from a conviction whenever the proceedings indicate the unfairness of trial without the help of a lawyer. Philyaw v. State, 288 Ark. 237, 704 S.W.2d 608 (1986), overruled, Oliver v. State, 323 Ark. 743, 918 S.W.2d 690 (1996).

       Where the trial court (i) removed defendant's public defender one month prior to trial, (ii) failed to sufficiently query defendant regarding his ability to pay for counsel, (iii) denied his motion for a continuance for the purpose of securing counsel, and (iv) required that defendant proceed at trial without counsel over his objection to proceeding pro se, the defendant was not improperly denied court appointed counsel but was improperly denied the benefit of any counsel.

       None of defendant's statements unambiguously and unequivocally indicated defendant's right to remain silent or a right to counsel; defendant was conscious of his Miranda rights and he continued to talk to the officer and answer his questions even though he knew it was against his best interest, and there was no error in allowing the indicated portions of the custodial statement.

       In a civil guardianship and conservatorship action, the trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate a ward's right to counsel of the ward's own choosing by appointing an attorney ad litem, who was wholly independent of those competing for the ward's care and custody, where the ward's original attorney also represented a brother, who was seeking appointment as the ward's guardian.

In essence, defendant was simply dissatisfied with counsel's efforts at negotiating with the State; he did not allege that counsel was incompetent.

       When a defendant invokes his Sixth Amendment right to counsel for a judicial proceeding unrelated to the present charge, but does not make any indication that he only wishes to deal with the police through counsel, he does not invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel; the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is case specific.

       An accused's right to counsel after a prosecution has commenced is case specific and cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions; therefore, defendant's invocation of his right to counsel in the robbery case did not constitute an invocation of the right to counsel during his subsequent custodial interrogation regarding the murder.

       Order granting an inmate's petition for postconviction relief in accordance with Ark. R. Crim.

       Trial court did not err in denying post-conviction relief where defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced when a pardoned sentence was introduced during the sentencing phase of his trial because, once the state offered the certified copy of the conviction, it had established a prima facie case and the burden shifted to defendant to establish the pardon; because no such evidence was introduced, the conviction was properly admitted.

       Trial court did not err in denying post-conviction relief where defendant claimed his counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach an informant regarding alleged inconsistent statements by using tape recorded conversations because there was no evidence that the jury would have resolved the credibility determination in defendant's favor such that it would have affected the outcome of his trial.

      <p>
       Denial of inmate's petition for postconviction relief was appropriate because she failed to prove that her counsel was ineffective since, to the extent that her argument concerned counsel's failure to call witnesses other than herself, the inmate failed to demonstrate that her defense was prejudiced. Additionally, prejudice could not be presumed regarding the inmate's sentence since she received a sentence that was less than the maximum allowed for that crime.

       Order denying an inmate's motion for postconviction relief under Ark. R. Crim.

      <p>
       Based on evidence seized from appellant's car following a traffic stop, he was convicted of possession of cocaine, simultaneous possession of drugs and firearms, and possession of a firearm by a felon; counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to suppress the evidence on the basis that appellant had not been tried on charges of speeding and driving on a suspended license. Whether a police officer has probable cause to make a traffic stop does not depend on whether the driver was actually guilty of the violation which the officer believed to have occurred.

       Counsel was not ineffective for failing to make an argument that was meritless; because defendant did not state a meritorious basis upon which counsel could have objected to the seating of the juror and the record clearly supported the juror's selection, defendant's claim as to ineffective assistance on that basis failed, and the supreme court would not label counsel ineffective merely because of possible bad tactics or strategy in selecting a jury.

R. Crim. P. 37.1 based on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The Supreme Court of Arkansas held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to introduce a letter to show that appellant's girlfriend was a “meth cook”; counsel did not commit fraud in hiring an investigator; counsel's failure to call the investigator to testify was a matter of trial tactics; and appellant was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to call additional witnesses.

He was not entitled to postconviction relief under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 based on counsel's failure to object to evidence that appellant and his girlfriend had been convicted of other crimes related to methamphetamine; the evidence was admissible under Ark. R. Evid. 404(b), as it was independently relevant to the issue of the identity of the driver and his relationship to the passenger.

       Trial counsel was not ineffective for failure to object to the charges pending against appellant for the manufacture of methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to manufacture methamphetamine on the basis that the charges were a violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy. The Supreme Court of Arkansas has held that possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to manufacture methamphetamine is not a lesser-included offense of manufacture of methamphetamine; therefore, appellant was not entitled to postconviction relief.

      <p>
       Denial of the inmate's petition for postconviction relief was appropriate because, to have shown prejudice and proven that she was deprived of a fair trial due to ineffective assistance of counsel, the inmate, who had pled guilty, was required to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, she would not have so pleaded and would have insisted on going to trial. It would have defied all logic for her to have asserted that she would not have entered a plea for the agreed-upon sentence if trial counsel had presented mitigating evidence, as any presentation of mitigating evidence would have occurred subsequent to the inmate entering the guilty plea, which she admitted was entered knowingly and intelligently.

       Trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to preserve the issue of sufficiency of the evidence by moving for a directed verdict because counsel “gave up nothing” by failing to move for a directed verdict; the victim's testimony established the elements of the rape charge, and that testimony alone was sufficient to support the verdict.

      <p>
       Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate the case, secure DNA evidence testing, and obtain expert medical testimony because a postconviction relief appellant did not establish any facts to support a conclusion that there was any evidence that could have been subjected to scientific testing and that would have been admissible, and since the victim did not immediately report the incident, any samples that could be later obtained through a medical exam or further investigation would not have been relevant to the rape charge; the testimony at trial established that the victim did not tell her mother or anyone else about the rape until a number of weeks after the incident, that her mother had washed and then disposed of the bloody panties that the victim had worn, that the victim was given a medical examination after she reported the incident, and that no samples were taken from the mattress upon which the incident occurred.

      <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying appellant's petition under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 because appellant failed to set forth facts sufficient to sustain a finding that any alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel resulted in prejudice since appellant could not show prejudice from any alleged error by trial counsel concerning a failure to impeach or discredit a statement of the victim's daughter; the admission of the statement was not prejudicial, and a failure to impeach the statement was not prejudicial because the evidence at trial, aside from the daughter's statement, was overwhelming.
   Rodriguez v. State, 2010 Ark. 78 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of inmate's appeal from the denial of his petition for postconviction relief was proper because he failed to prove that he received ineffective assistance of counsel; counsel testified, and the record confirmed, that he did question a police officer concerning a relationship with a witness and the inmate did not introduce any evidence or information of such a relationship that counsel might have found from further investigation or that counsel could have used to impeach the officer's testimony. Further, challenges to a witness's credibility were not cognizable claims in proceedings under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 and allegations that trial counsel did not communicate with the inmate or investigate the case and was unprepared for trial were likewise deficient in factual substantiation.
   Dunlap v. State, 2010 Ark. 111 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying a prisoner's petition for postconviction relief because the prisoner did not set forth facts sufficient to state a cognizable claim; the prisoner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning procedural defects in the plea proceedings, failure to comply with Ark. R. Crim. P. 24, and trial counsel's failure to seek suppression of evidence or raise a defense were conclusory, and his other allegations of error, those concerning the negotiation procedures, counsel's inaction in raising issues in the negotiations, and counsel's failure to request jury sentencing, would not have had any impact on appellant's ultimate decision to accept the plea offer that he received.
   Shaw v. State, 2010 Ark. 112 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant failed to preserve two of defendant's claims regarding counsel's alleged ineffectiveness, because counsel's decision to inform the jury about defendant's pending drug charges was one of trial strategy, and because defendant instructed counsel not to introduce any evidence in mitigation at sentencing, defendant failed to show that counsel was ineffective; therefore, defendant's petition for postconviction relief under Ark. R. App. P. Crim. 37.1 was properly denied.
   Sykes v. State, 2011 Ark. 412 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate's petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 was proper because he failed to prove that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. A juror stated that she had not formed an opinion about the inmate's guilt or innocence, and affirmed that she would base her decision on the evidence; further, trial counsel was not ineffective with regard to an argument for vindictive sentencing because two different judges presided over the inmate's trials, different sentencers imposed the two sentences, and thus, the presumption of vindictiveness did not arise.

      <p>
       Appellant's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to a wording error contained in a verdict form because the correct statutory language was consistently used throughout the other pleadings, instructions, and verdict forms; thus, any error on the part of counsel was harmless, and appellant failed to prove prejudice.
   Richardson v. State, 2011 Ark. 478 (2011).

      <p>
       Appellant's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's failure to arraign appellant on the enhanced charge of possessing cocaine within 1,000 feet of a public-housing development because appellant was not prejudiced by the lack of a formal arraignment on the enhancement; appellant received the same rights at trial as he would have had he been arraigned, and because appellant was tried on the charge, he waived formal arraignment by appearing and announcing that he was ready for trial.
   Richardson v. State, 2011 Ark. 478 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of inmate's petition for postconviction relief from two judgments entered in 2009 on a number of drug-related charges was proper because he was not credible in his testimony to establish that he would not have entered guilty pleas if counsel had not pressured him by requesting more money for trial. He failed to meet his burden of showing prejudice from any deficient performance on the part of trial counsel.
   Heard v. State, 2012 Ark. 67 (2012).

       Denial of inmate's petition for writ of certiorari was proper because he failed to prove that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of inmate's petition for writ of certiorari was proper because the evidence at issue presented a jury question concerning whether the informant had induced the commission of the offense, and the jury was given an instruction on the affirmative defense of entrapment.

       Circuit court clearly erred in denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief, because the petition provided specific facts to establish actual prejudice due to counsel's conduct at trial and the allegations were not conclusory, when counsel's performance was deficient by failing to suppress defendant's custodial statement as a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the deficient performance prejudiced the defense since the inclusion of defendant's statement as the state's evidence at trial and used in affirming the conviction was sufficient to find that there was a reasonable probability that the decision reached would have been different absent counsel's failure to suppress the statement; the conviction resulted from a breakdown in the adversarial process that rendered the result unreliable.

       To establish a voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel, the trial judge must explain to the accused that he is entitled as a matter of law to an attorney and question him to see if he can afford to hire counsel; the judge must also explain the desirability of having the assistance of an attorney during the trial and the problems attendant to one representing himself.

       Where the attorney testified he did not remember whether he told the defendant he could keep him as his attorney, and the record did not reveal that the trial judge ever so informed the defendant, the defendant's act in releasing the attorney could not be viewed as a waiver of a right to counsel. Philyaw v. State, 288 Ark. 237, 704 S.W.2d 608 (1986), overruled, Oliver v. State, 323 Ark. 743, 918 S.W.2d 690 (1996).

      <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to supress certain statements she made during questioning regarding her missing child; although defendant claimed that she had done the best she could to convey to the officer that she was concerned about continuing to talk to him without a lawyer present, when the officer asked defendant whether she was asking for a lawyer, she did not answer that question but, rather, continued answering other questions and did not mention a lawyer again during the interview.

       Defendant's convictions for felony theft of property and breaking and entering were improper where the trial court erred in forcing defendant to be represented by counsel and in refusing to allow him to appear pro se; while the trial court might have had good intentions to protect him from his ignorance, it failed to apprise him of the dangers of self-representation, and the failure to do so constituted reversible error.

      <p>
       Defendant's right to counsel under Ark. Const. art. 2, § 10 and the Sixth Amendment was violated because he did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel where trial court failed to make an inquiry as to his understanding of the legal process and did not specifically warn him of the substantive risks of proceeding without counsel; also, defendant did not get substantial assistance from his standby counsel. Parker v. State, 93 Ark. App. 472, 220 S.W.3d 238 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court erred in finding defendant waived the right to counsel; the waiver was equivocal because he stated he would only represent himself if he could not have another attorney, and it was not knowing and intelligent because the court made only minimal inquiries of his education but did not discuss the risks of proceeding without counsel.

       In a first-degree murder case, the trial court did not err in finding that appellant had effectively waived his right to counsel where the record was replete with colloquies between the court and appellant as it pertained to his desire to proceed pro se, appellant had access to competent counsel, and he was obviously attempting to prevent the scheduled trial and thwart the court system; under these circumstances, the trial court was correct in refusing to replace that counsel.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by finding that defendant made an unequivocal and knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel and could proceed pro se because he was appointed at least three different attorneys and each time stated he did not want the appointed counsel to represent him and would prefer to represent himself, he was given several continuances to find an attorney willing to accept his case but he was unable to do so, and the trial court warned him of the dangers associated with self-representation at several hearings and notified him of his right to counsel.

       When an accused appears with retained counsel, the trial judge should not allow the attorney of record to withdraw until: (1) new counsel has been retained; or (2) a showing of indigency has been made and counsel has been appointed; or (3) a voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel is established on the record. Philyaw v. State, 288 Ark. 237, 704 S.W.2d 608 (1986), overruled, Oliver v. State, 323 Ark. 743, 918 S.W.2d 690 (1996).

      <p>
       While defendant's motion to relieve his attorney of record did set forth certain differences between himself and his counsel regarding the fee arrangement, it did not expressly state that his attorney's representation was compromised by a conflict of interest; in denying the motions, the circuit court considered the length of time the matter had been pending and the proximity of the trial date, and the appellate court would not rank speculation about whether counsel was hampered or impaired in any respect by a purported conflict of interest.

       The trial court was without authority to impose additional sentence authorized by statute on conviction of felony while armed with a firearm where the jury had made no specific finding as to that effect, and the imposition of the additional sentence deprived the defendant of his right to a trial by jury.

      <p>
       Procedural rules governing jury trials are not intended to diminish the right to a jury trial; these rules should be interpreted so as not to give effect to dubious waivers of rights and to hold otherwise would be to hold that a rule of appellate procedure supersedes an express provision of the constitution.

       There was no error in the court's failure to grant a change of venue to a Negro defendant because of an alleged race riot taking place in the county seat where the defendant did not move for a change of venue and the record was silent as to the existence of a race riot or other type of public disturbance. Scott v. State, 249 Ark. 967, 463 S.W.2d 404 (1971).

      <p>
       Where the site of the murder trial could have been changed to any courthouse in the district where the defendants would have been more likely to have received a more fair and impartial trial, the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the motion for a change of venue.

       In capital felony murder trial, where court granted motion for change of venue and moved trial to county adjacent to the one in which the crime occurred, and where two codefendants were tried in other counties of the judicial district and the only other forum available was closer to the scene of the crime than the court's choice of venue, defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to move for another change of venue. Pickens v. Lockhart, 714 F.2d 1455 (8th Cir. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's denial of motion for change of venue was not error where, although the crime took place in the only two counties in the judicial circuit, the court also determined that the publicity concerning the case was not so overwhelming and prejudicial that the defendant could not receive a fair trial in the county in which he was tried. Simmons v. Lockhart, 814 F.2d 504 (8th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">485 U.S. 1015</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 1489</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">99 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's change-of-venue motion alleging adverse pretrial publicity was properly denied in light of the testimony introduced at the hearing which showed less-than-pervasive publicity, the failure of defendant to demonstrate during voir dire that there were publicity-affected jurors, and the fact that he did not use all his peremptory challenges. Rankin v. State, 329 Ark. 379, 948 S.W.2d 397 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitution provides that a defendant's right to be tried in the county where the crime was committed is qualified by his right to apply for a change of venue “in such a manner as now is, or may be, prescribed by law” and, thus, contemplates that the manner by which venue may be changed will be determined by legislative enactment. Dansby v. State, 338 Ark. 697, 1 S.W.3d 403 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court complied with this section of the Arkansas Constitution and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c88s16-88-203" target="_blank">16-88-203</a></cite> when it acted upon the defendant's first request for a change of venue and transferred venue to another county; although the defendant labeled his second motion as a motion to withdraw the earlier request for a change of venue, it was actually nothing more than a request for a second change of venue and, therefore, was discretionary with the trial judge. Dansby v. State, 338 Ark. 697, 1 S.W.3d 403 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Affidavits from members of the petit jury stating that defendant could not receive a fair trial due to pretrial publicity were not enough to show that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion for change of venue; the trial court took extensive precautions to ensure defendant a fair trial, all jurors who were possibly tainted with pretrial publicity were dismissed, and defendant voiced his approval of each juror selected. Porter v. State, 359 Ark. 323, 197 S.W.3d 445 (2004).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where two states have concurrent jurisdiction over a boundary river, an indictment found in the county adjoining the river, for a crime committed on the river, does not violate the Constitution. Brown v. State, 109 Ark. 373, 159 S.W. 1132 (1913).

      <p>
       Statement made to a detective as part of a criminal investigation was testimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes.
   Hughes v. State, 2012 Ark. App. 586 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated at the hearing to revoke defendant's suspended sentence; although the jailer whom defendant was accused of having assaulted did not testify, a video of the attack was shown and defendant was allowed to confront and cross-examine all of the witnesses who testified at the hearing. Furthermore, no hearsay evidence was offered.

       The testimony of a witness before a committing magistrate, where defendant had the opportunity of cross-examination, may be read as secondary evidence. Hurley v. State, 29 Ark. 17 (1874); Dolan v. State, 40 Ark. 454 (1883).

       The right to cross-examine prosecution's witnesses is not unlimited. Bowden v. State, 301 Ark. 303, 783 S.W.2d 842 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       To determine where restrictions placed on the right to cross-examine a witness rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation, a reviewing court must look “to the record as a whole” and resolve whether the restrictions imposed by the trial court on defendant's cross-examination created a substantial danger of prejudice by depriving defendant of a meaningful opportunity to elicit available, relevant information that was likely to effectively impeach the credibility of the witness. Bowden v. State, 301 Ark. 303, 783 S.W.2d 842 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is generally permissible for an accused to show by cross-examination anything bearing on the bias of the testimony of a material witness. Billett v. State, 317 Ark. 346, 877 S.W.2d 913 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of an accused to show the bias of a witness does not lie within the trial court's discretion; however, once the main circumstances showing bias have been admitted, the trial judge does have the discretion to determine how far the examiner may delve into the details. Billett v. State, 317 Ark. 346, 877 S.W.2d 913 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court may impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based upon concerns about harassment, prejudice, waste of time, unnecessary duplication of testimony, confusion of issues, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant. Billett v. State, 317 Ark. 346, 877 S.W.2d 913 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to demonstrate a violation of his right of confrontation; defendant was not denied the opportunity to effectively cross-examine the informant regarding her motives for testifying, and the circuit court found that further cross-examination with respect to the informant's pending criminal charges was of marginal relevance and unduly prejudicial.

       The testimony of a witness given in a former trial may be admitted in evidence where the witness is out of the state. A witness is competent to testify as to the testimony of another witness on former trial, although unable to give his exact words. Vaughan v. State, 58 Ark. 353, 24 S.W. 885 (1894).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because what was at stake in a bond-revocation hearing was substantially different from what was at stake in a full-fledged hearing at trial, the State did not demonstrate that defendant had a similar motive in the trial in order to make use of Ark. R. Evid. 804(b)(1); thus, the unavailable officer's testimony from the bond-revocation hearing was erroneously admitted into evidence. Proctor v.

       Even though defendant's right to confront witnesses against him was violated by a detective's remote testimony through two-way live video, the error was harmless because of the victims'
   detailed testimony of the sexual misconduct, which was sufficient to support defendant's convictions, the testimony of both victims'
   mothers and other witnesses, and the additional photos that were introduced outside of the detective's testimony.

      <p>
       In a contest of the probate of a will begun 11½ years after the will was probated, the probate court does not have jurisdiction to set aside its former judgment, and this is no denial of the right to a remedy for all injuries which may be received.

       A statute requiring the party appealing the decision of an appraisal board to pay attorney's fees in court in the event of unfavorable judgment is unconstitutional for violation of the right to a remedy for all injuries or wrongs.

      <p>
       Appellate court rejected plaintiff's argument that Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 13 supersedes Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 20, noting that the argument was indistinguishable from that made in Milligan v. Singer, 2019 Ark. 177; the legislature established the Arkasas State Claims Commission so that claims against the State may be addressed while preserving the State's sovereign immunity. However, in their individual capacities, state officials do not enjoy the immunity granted to the State under Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 20.

       This section is a limitation upon the power of government and not an authorization for the issuance of search warrants. Grimmett v. State, 251 Ark. 270a, 476 S.W.2d 217 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “unreasonable search” in this section is interpreted by Arkansas courts in the same manner that the Supreme Court interprets that term in U.S. Const. Amend. 4. Stout v. State, 320 Ark. 552, 898 S.W.2d 457 (1995).

      <p>
       Supreme Court of Arkansas interprets this section in the same manner as the United States Supreme Court interprets the Fourth Amendment. Mullinax v. State, 327 Ark. 41, 938 S.W.2d 801, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">520 U.S. 1252</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 2411</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">138 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 176 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the search and seizure language of Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 15 is very similar to the words of the Fourth Amendment, Arkansas courts are not bound by the federal interpretation of the Fourth Amendment when interpreting Arkansas law. State v. Brown, 356 Ark. 460, 156 S.W.3d 722 (2004).

       Motion to suppress evidence was improperly granted because, where police had known an informant to give reliable information in the past, and accurate information was received from the informant about defendant and his vehicle, officers had specific, particularized, and articulable reasons for thinking that defendant was involved in criminal activity, which justified a stop under Ark. R. Crim. P. 3.1. Because the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop and detain the vehicle, any pretext on the part of the officers was irrelevant; moreover, the officers did not need any additional reasonable suspicion to justify a canine sniff, which was not a search under the Fourth Amendment.

       In a drug case, a motion to suppress should have been granted because a canine sniff was conducted on a vehicle without reasonable suspicion for a continued detention after a traffic stop. Defendant picked up a package that had a strong odor of dryer sheets, the package contained a California return address and was addressed to someone besides defendant, a package with the same return address had been previously intercepted by the post office, neither of the names on the package were associated with the respective street addresses, and defendant did not sign for the package with his own name.

       Because officers failed to knock and announce their presence before entering defendant parolee's hotel room and because there was no reasonable basis for their failure to knock and announce, the officers'
   conduct violated defendant's protection from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 15. The exclusionary rule did not apply to the violation, however.

Likewise, the Supreme Court of Arkansas holds that in the case of parolees, the exclusionary rule does not apply to knock-and-announce violations under Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 15. Exclusion is not warranted because the relationship between discovery of the evidence and the constitutional violation is sufficiently attenuated.

       Police officer engaged in racial profiling prohibited by state statute, the state constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and the city's written policy, and the officer also illegally seized one of the plaintiffs, thereby violating U.S. Const., Amend. IV and the state constitution; the police chief, who supervised the officer and ran the police department, was deliberately indifferent to ongoing and systemic racial profiling of which he was aware and municipal liability was imposed on the city as it permitted the officer to establish and to carry out a custom and practice of engaging in racial profiling. The officer's true objective was not to enforce traffic laws prohibiting people from driving with their vision obstructed or other minor infractions; rather, the neutral traffic laws were used as a pretext for harassing Hispanics (whether here legally or illegally), for obtaining money through fines and towing charges for the financially troubled city, and to provide an incentive for Hispanics to move out of the area—clearly illegitimate objectives.

       It was error to grant a motion to suppress drug evidence obtained in a traffic stop on the ground that the stop for a traffic violation was a pretext for searching for drugs because the pretextual stop was not impermissible under either the federal or Arkansas Constitution and, thus, did not invalidate the otherwise lawful stop of the vehicle.

       Trial court did not err in denying appellant's petition for postconviction relief under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 because appellant did not establish that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve the issue of whether this section required an officer requesting consent for a search to advise the driver of an automobile that he or she had the right to refuse to consent to the search, and under the circumstances and precedent as existed at the time of appellant's trial, counsel's conduct did not fall outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance since counsel was not ineffective simply because he did not raise an argument that would have been largely against established precedent and would have required exceptionally thoughtful and extensive analysis; good cause for an extension to vehicles of the rule that officers who utilize the knock-and-talk procedure must inform a home dweller that he or she has the right to refuse consent to the search will require something more than the mere recitation of Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 15.

       It is doubtful that defendant would have been arrested simply for traveling 40 miles per hour in a 35-mile zone and possessing a corroding roofing hatchet that had clearly been in his vehicle for quite some time, therefore, the search and seizure was pretextual and was properly suppressed.

       Police officer had authority to arrest defendant because defendant was seen speeding away from the scene of an attempted robbery and his description matched that given by an eyewitness to the crime; hence, there was probable cause to arrest defendant and to search his car, where the wallet of the other robbery perpetrator was found, and defendant's pretrial motion to suppress all evidence obtained after his arrest was properly denied.

       Trial court did not err in finding that defendant's arrest was valid; given that defendant was the last person seen at the crime scene, defendant's girlfriend gave police the murder weapon, and defendant had access to a gun, the police had probable cause to arrest defendant without a warrant pursuant to Ark.

       Where a confidential informant appeared at a drug dealer's home to buy drugs, the drug dealer's wife contacted defendant, and defendant immediately left his home carrying a package, drove to the dealer's home, entered the home without knocking, and left a short time thereafter without the package, the police had probable cause to effect a warrantless arrest of defendant because the evidence essentially established a call by a known drug dealer requesting the delivery of narcotics from a supplier, immediate movement by a known drug supplier who was the suspected supplier, direct travel by that supplier to the source of the supply request, and the apparent delivery of a package. While this proof may not have been sufficient to convict defendant, it provided sufficient probable cause to make an arrest, and a search of defendant incident to that arrest was proper.

       The U.S. Supreme Court has held that an arrest may not be used as a pretext to search for evidence. Pretext is a matter of the arresting officer's intent, and the whole issue of pretext turns on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest. State v.

      <p>
       Trooper made a traffic stop because he had probable cause to believe that defendants' vehicle had violated a traffic law, namely following too closely; thus, even in the absence of reasonable suspicion and without violating the Fourth Amendment, the trooper, with his police dog at the trooper's immediate disposal, could perform a permissible canine sniff, and once the dog alerted, that constituted probable cause for the trooper to search defendants' vehicle.

      <p>
       Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress where the officer conceded at the suppression hearing that he never advised defendant of his right to refuse to consent to the search such that the search of the house was invalid; under Ark. Const. art. 2, § 15, an officer who utilizes the knock-and-talk technique is required to inform the home dweller that he or she has the right to refuse to consent to the search. Carson v.

       Failure of officers to advise a person that he or she has the right to refuse consent to a search of his or her home violates the right against warrantless intrusions into the home; however, such holding does not extend to the search of a vehicle.

       Search of defendant's vehicle was not in violation of the Arkansas Constitution because the knock-and-talk procedure, during which officers were required to inform a home dweller that he or she had the right to refuse consent to a search, did not apply to the search of a vehicle; hence, defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied because defendant consented to the search.

       Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress a crack pipe that was found in a vehicle in which he was a passenger because the officer's initial approach of the vehicle was valid under Ark. R. Crim. P. 2.2; although defendant might have been illegally seized when the officer ordered him out of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle gave consent to the vehicle search independent of any violation of defendant's rights, and defendant lacked standing to challenge the vehicle search.

      </p>
      <p>
       One of the established exceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search conducted pursuant to consent and that a co-occupant has the authority to consent to a search; thus, the search of the vehicle's exterior was within the scope of the consent granted by the driver, and the police officer's observations of modifications beneath the bed of the truck indicative of a false compartment for the concealment of contraband gave rise to probable cause to perform the more intrusive search of drilling holes in the truck's bed. Turner v. State, 94 Ark. App. 259, 229 S.W.3d 588 (2006).

      <p>
       Consent-in-advance clauses that are signed by parolees or probationers are not constitutionally infirm as long as the consent agreement meets certain criteria; in order to support a warrantless search, the form must amount to a consent to search, and the search must be conducted in accordance with the terms of the consent granted.

       Officer drove past a closed gas station where he observed two vehicles in the parking lot, there were no signs of criminal activity, no moving violations, nor any defective equipment on the vehicles; nonetheless, he stopped one vehicle, questioned the driver, asked him to get out of the car, and seized marijuana from the vehicle and defendant's person. The trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence, because the police encounter was illegal; there was no evidence to suggest that community caretaking was the reason for the encounter.

       After defendant's arrest for driving without a valid driver's licence, an officer saw marijuana seeds under the driver's seat, detected a faint odor of marijuana in the vehicle, and noticed the gas tank exhibited signs of tampering, typical of drug-smuggling; the officer gleaned probable cause to search the vehicle for narcotics as he waited for the wrecker to tow the vehicle to impound.

       The defendant did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in a deer stand and, therefore, a search of the deer stand by a wildlife officer was proper where a person standing inside the box was exposed to the public's view, there was no evidence that the defendant used the stand to engage in private activity other than eating meals or that he attempted to shield his activities from the public, and the defendant employed no apparent means of restricting access to the deer stand.

       No authority existed for a “knock and search” doctrine holding that, after knocking, it was permissible to begin a warrantless search before anyone came to the door; thus, where police officers began searching residence before defendant was summoned, an illegal search was performed that was prohibited by the state constitution.

       Failure of three task force agents to advise one defendant who answered the door that she had the right to refuse consent to a search of her residence violated both defendants' rights against warrantless intrusions into the home; hence, the court properly granted defendants' motions to suppress the evidence seized during the search.

       In a “knock and talk” procedure whereby police officers went to defendants' residence without sufficient probable cause to obtain a search warrant and ask the first defendant to allow them entry and, after gaining entry, informed her that they were investigating potential criminal activity and requested permission to search, none of the officers informed the second defendant that he had the right to refuse consent to the entry and subsequent search of his home; thus, the trial court should have granted the second defendant's motion to suppress all of the evidence that flowed from that unconstitutional search.

      <p>
       Under the Fourth Amendment, officers’ warrantless entry into defendant’s residence was not justified by the exigent circumstance that evidence was about to be destroyed; the officers had the opportunity to seek and secure a warrant and it was reasonably foreseeable that the officers’ chosen strategy of approaching defendant’s residence and announcing their presence, only minutes after a controlled delivery had occurred, would create a situation in which defendant would attempt to destroy the evidence. Mann v. State, 357 Ark. 159, 161 S.W.3d 826 (2004), abrogated as stated in State v. Brewster, 2011 Ark. 530, 385 S.W.3d 844 (2011).

       Court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence where defendant did not voluntarily consent to a search of his home and his offer to show officers his artwork was not an invitation to enter his home and conduct a search but, rather, defendant intended to go inside his home and retrieve printed copies of his artwork to bring outside and show the officers; further, there was no break in time or other intervening event between the illegal warrantless entry into defendant's home, his written consent to search the home, and his written statement, thus, the primary taint of the unlawful warrantless entry into the home had not been sufficiently attenuated or purged.

       Warrantless nighttime intrusion into defendants' home was improper under Ark. R. Crim.

       In an affidavit for a search warrant, if an officer swears that there is contraband at a particular address, there are three possibilities for the basis of his conclusion: (1) the officer has seen the illegal object or objects in which event his affidavit should assert his personal observation; (2) the officer observed or perceived facts from which the presence of the contraband may reasonably be inferred, in which event the affidavit must recite the perceived facts so that the magistrate may judge the existence of probable cause; (3) the officer obtained the information from someone else, as for example an informer, in which event the warrant should not issue unless good cause is shown in the affidavit or supporting testimony for crediting the hearsay.

   search of a safe was within the scope of the search authorized by the warrant because the safe was large enough to contain drugs, drug paraphernalia and the second handgun described by the informant. The fact that the officers had already discovered some drugs and drug paraphernalia did not preclude them from continuing to search for drugs and drug paraphernalia and the second handgun.
   State v. Stites, 2009 Ark. 154, 300 S.W.3d 103 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a legitimate search is under way, and when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined, police officers need not obtain a second warrant to search containers found during a premises search.

       Where search warrant described premises to be searched as farmhouse, barn, and curtilage and appurtenances, the description was sufficient to authorize police officers to search a chicken house and a hay shed on the farm. State v. Cashion, 260 Ark. 148, 539 S.W.2d 423 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of the recitations required by court rules did not substantially prejudice defendant where the search warrant was executed and the return made within a few hours after the warrant was issued, the officer offered a sworn statement that evidence of the crimes might be disposed of by morning, and the magistrate's actual issuance of the search warrant established his finding of probable cause even more positively than the insertion of a conclusory finding to that effect would have. Harris v. State, 262 Ark. 506, 558 S.W.2d 143 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of a reference to time in an affidavit does not make the subsequent warrant automatically defective, however, where the omission of any reference to time is so complete that none can be inferred, the affidavit is defective and the warrant invalid. Herrington v. State, 287 Ark. 228, 697 S.W.2d 899 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule should not be applied when the warrant is so facially deficient that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid. An arrest warrant which fails to particularize or enumerate the crime for which the suspect was arrested is facially deficient. Abbott v. State, 307 Ark. 278, 819 S.W.2d 694 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the officers' experience with the drug task force, they could not have reasonably presumed that the arrest warrant was valid on its face as it stated that defendant had committed an offense that did not exist under former § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c64s5-64-401" target="_blank">5-64-401</a></cite>.

       A chancellor can enforce an order to compel conduct, even if it is an order to pay money, by the contempt power, but the contempt power is limited to cases where the contemnor has the ability to pay. Gould v. Gould, 308 Ark. 213, 823 S.W.2d 890 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the parties had agreed to each pay one-half the college expenses of any child that chose to attend college, where the mother later declined to pay her half, the trial judge clearly erred in holding the mother in contempt because she demonstrated by more than a preponderance of the evidence that her failure to reimburse the father for college expenses was not due to “willful obstinacy,” but financial inability coupled with ill health; also relevant and material were the mother's assertions that their adult daughter's illness required her to take care of their granddaughter and assume some of those financial responsibilities, and the trial judge's exclusion of the latter evidence unfairly interfered with the mother's defense and constituted an abuse of discretion.

       County tax collector erred in including 2.75 mills in the total ad valorem rate and applying a portion of them to the redevelopment district because the mills were passed to repay proposed school bonds; under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.14.html#t14c168s14-168-301ol118Bi" target="_blank">14-168-301(18)(B)(i)</a></cite>, the “total ad valorem rate” excluded increases that were pledged for repayment of a specific bond issue.

Suggs v. State, 322 Ark. 40, 907 S.W.2d 124 (1995).

       The “cruel or depraved manner” aggravating circumstance, which had not been enacted at the time the crime was committed, is not a merely procedural provision and could not be applied ex post facto.

       Defendant correctly asserted that the application of the 70 percent parole-eligibility rule to defendant's sentence for manufacture of methamphetamine, a 1998 offense, would have been an ex post facto law in violation of the federal and state constitutions; however, defense counsel never raised an objection to the application of the 70 percent parole-eligibility rule at trial, defendant's case did not come within the scope of any of the recognized exceptions to the contemporaneous objection rule, and Arkansas did not adhere to the “plain error” rule, thus, defendant's argument was not preserved for review.

       Capital felony provisions of an act cannot be applied to offenses committed prior to its enactment because if they were the act would be an ex post facto law. Upton v. Graves, 255 Ark. 516, 509 S.W.2d 823 (1973).

       Statute enhancing penalties for successive offenses of drunken driving was not an ex post facto law as applied to provide enhanced penalties against a driver whose third offense occurred after the effective date of the act but whose first two offenses occurred prior to such date.

       Defendant failed to preserve his argument on appeal that the circuit court erred in sentencing him as an habitual offender based on conduct that occurred before the conviction that was used for enhancement purposes; while defendant specifically requested a ruling based on the due-process clauses of the state and federal constitutions, at no time did he assert to the circuit court that the application of the sentencing enhancement provisions violated the ex post facto clause of either constitution.

       Because a property owner was cited for violating the city code by failing to abate a nuisance months after the ordinance had been changed, no ex post facto application of the punishment for failure to abate a nuisance occurred.

       Circuit court erred in denying an inmate's in forma pauperis petition because he stated sufficient non-conclusory facts to assert a colorable claim for judicial review of an alleged violation of the ex post-facto prohibition; the inmate specifically alleged that his term of incarceration was extended by two years through the retroactive application of the current parole-eligibility statute, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c93s16-93-615" target="_blank">16-93-615</a></cite>, as compared to the former statute that was in effect when he committed his crime.

       The municipal ordinance which requires that all printed matter, blank books, and stationery used by the city bear the union label of the Allied Printing Trades Council created a virtual monopoly in the city's printing business and cannot be reconciled with the controlling provisions of the Constitution and statutes. Upchurch v. Adelsberger, 231 Ark. 682, 332 S.W.2d 242 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       A law demanding competition in the letting of public work is intended to secure unrestricted competition among bidders, and where the effect of an ordinance is to prevent or restrict competition and thus increase the cost of the work, it manifestly violates such law and is void, as are all proceedings had thereunder.

       Ensuring adequate waste disposal resources was a valid exercise of the state's police power to protect public health, thus, a de facto monopoly, if it did exist, was necessary to carry out the Northwest Arkansas Regional Solid Waste Management District's statutory duties; further, its regulation requiring that solid waste be disposed at either in-district or out-of-state landfills, unless otherwise authorized by the district, did not violate this section.

      <p>
       Where a defendant in the federal court claimed that the statute as applied to him violated this section of the Constitution, he raised Arkansas constitutional questions which had not been decided by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and the federal court therefore retained the case on the docket so that appropriate action could be commenced in the state court to determine these constitutional questions. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. White River Distribs., Inc., 118 F. Supp. 541 (E.D. Ark. 1954).
      </p>

       Perpetuities are forbidden by this section. Roemhild v. Jones, 239 F.2d 492 (8th Cir. 1957); Broach v. City of Hampton, 283 Ark. 496, 677 S.W.2d 851 (1984).

      </p>
      <p>
       The rule against perpetuities is alive, well, and fully applicable to terminate interests where those interests do not vest within 21 years after some life in being at the time of the creation of the instrument; however, the rule has no application to reversionary interests, which remain in the transferor and heirs.

Dos Santos, S.A. v. Beebe, 418 F. Supp. 2d 1064 (W.D. Ark. 2006).

       Where a tobacco products manufacturer which did not participate in a settlement between states and tobacco companies alleged that an amendment to a statute implementing the settlement improperly eliminated a refund of the manufacturer's escrowed overpayments in the settlement account for the prior year, the retroactive application of the amendment properly stated a claim for violation of the manufacturer's constitutional right to substantive due process. Dos Santos, S.A. v. Beebe, 418 F. Supp. 2d 1064 (W.D. Ark. 2006).

       The right of eminent domain is inherent in the government but the legislature is bound to provide a fair compensation to the individual whose property is taken and, until a just indemnity is afforded, the power cannot be legally exercised. Ex parte Martin, 13 Ark. 198 (1853).
      </p>
      <p>
       Private property cannot be taken for private use without consent of the owner, nor for public use without providing for just compensation. Roberts v. Williams, 15 Ark. 43 (1854).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sovereign right of a state to condemn private property for public use involves the correlative right of an individual to just compensation for the property thus condemned. Young v. Gurdon, 169 Ark. 399, 275 S.W. 890 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the actual taking or damage of lands for public use which must be compensated under the Constitution, and not a plan to take or damage the land. Watson v. Harris, 214 Ark. 349, 216 S.W.2d 784 (1949); Southwestern Water Co. v. Merritt, 224 Ark. 499, 275 S.W.2d 18 (1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that the property should be completely taken in order to bring the case within the protection of the constitutional guaranty, it is only necessary that there be such serious interruption of the common and necessary use of the property as to interfere with the rights of the owner. Shellnut v. Ark. State Game & Fish Comm'n, 222 Ark. 25, 258 S.W.2d 570 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not mean that an individual is constitutionally guaranteed the right to do with such property as he wishes in all circumstances. The police power and health and welfare doctrines clearly permit restrictions on property use so as to prevent detriment to the rights of the public, and the private use of property can be restricted by zoning regulations.

       Circuit court properly denied the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's (AGFC) motion to dismiss because there was no basis for the assertion of sovereign immunity based on the fact that a plaintiff could not seek monetary damages from the State; while the complaint stated that AGFC had to compensate the owners, the prayer for relief did not include a request for monetary damages, and the owners stated in their brief that they were not seeking monetary damages.

       Circuit court did not err in affirming an order of the Oil and Gas Commission integrating an owner's unleased mineral interests into a drilling unit because the owner failed to satisfy his burden of showing that §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c72s15-72-303" target="_blank">15-72-303</a></cite> and <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c72s15-72-304" target="_blank">15-72-304</a></cite> clearly violated the Arkansas Constitution; the Commission's integration of the owner's mineral interest was not a compensable taking but a constitutional exercise of the State's police power.

       Ark. Const., Art. 12, § 9, does not suggest the right of eminent domain is limited to corporations; to read that section with such implied restrictions would be contrary to the court's interpretation of the general grant of eminent domain to the state in this constitutional provision. Young v. Energy Transp. Sys., 278 Ark. 146, 644 S.W.2d 266 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">465 U.S. 1105</cite>, <cite class="s_court">104 S. Ct. 1606</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">80 L.

       Legislature has the power to make all property in the state subject to taxation, except property specifically exempted by the Constitution, and to provide where and in what manner taxes shall be levied and collected. Arco Auto Carriers, Inc. v. State, 232 Ark. 779, 341 S.W.2d 15 (1960), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">365 U.S. 770</cite>, <cite class="s_court">81 S.

       The improper adoption of a tax by a county does not prohibit the subsequent imposition of the same or similar tax by the proper authority. City of Little Rock v. Waters, 303 Ark. 363, 797 S.W.2d 426 (1990), overruled, Daniel v. Jones, 332 Ark. 489, 966 S.W.2d 226 (1998).

      <p>
       Circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the University of Arkansas because the University was an instrumentality of the State of Arkansas and possessed sovereign immunity from ad valorem taxation; based on the plain language of the Arkansas Constitution, the Constitution does not state that sovereign property is subject to ad valorem taxation.

       There is a distinction between an infringement upon a religious belief, which is absolutely prohibited, and a limitation upon a religious action, which is subject to reasonable laws designed to protect the public health or welfare; those laws may limit the time, place, and manner of action.

       Where a state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on adherents to modify their behavior and to violate their beliefs, a burden upon religion exists; while the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial.

       This section does not prohibit the state from compelling children to attend school nor from appointing a guardian to have children vaccinated against smallpox in order to permit them to attend even though the parents contend that vaccination is contrary to their religious beliefs. Cude v. State, 237 Ark. 927, 377 S.W.2d 816 (1964).

       The opening of a parochial school falls within the ambit of a religious action and is subject to reasonable limitation upon the time, place, and manner of operation; as a general rule, land use regulation by zoning may be a reasonable limitation upon the place of operation of a parochial school. Abram v. City of Fayetteville, 281 Ark. 63, 661 S.W.2d 371 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where zoning ordinance clearly manifested the city's legislative decision to use different criteria when considering an application for a conditional use permit for a church than when considering such a permit for a school, the ordinance was intended as a land use regulation, and the distinction between churches and schools was valid since a school is a more intensive use of land than a church. There is no constitutional prohibition against different requirements for different uses. Abram v. City of Fayetteville, 281 Ark. 63, 661 S.W.2d 371 (1983).

       Evidence was sufficient to show that soldier, who had resided in state for three months before divorce suit was filed, intended to make his residence in Arkansas; thus, he was an Arkansas resident and entitled to bring suit for divorce.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The General Assembly has from time to time created a board or commission empowered to carry out a regulatory function and has authorized the Governor to execute the function of appointing board members without senate approval, and this is appropriate where the constitution is silent on which branch of government should make the appointments. Clinton v. Clinton, 305 Ark. 585, 810 S.W.2d 923 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the Public Service Commission is created by the General Assembly and performs legislative functions, the General Assembly may still delegate the right to appoint commissioners to the Governor. Clinton v. Clinton, 305 Ark. 585, 810 S.W.2d 923 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Empowering the Governor to appoint special Public Service Commission commissioners, without senate approval, is a valid delegation of authority by the legislature to the branch of government that is equipped to execute and implement legislative mandates; therefore, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.23.html#t23c02s23-2-102ol1a" target="_blank">23-2-102(a)</a></cite> passes constitutional muster. Clinton v. Clinton, 305 Ark. 585, 810 S.W.2d 923 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The judicial branch cannot take away the discretion to make a decision which is reposed in the executive branch. Harvey v. Clinton, 308 Ark. 546, 826 S.W.2d 236 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of language in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.14.html#t14c94s14-94-127" target="_blank">14-94-127</a></cite>, directing the chancery court to use a particular method for computing the tax levy, bestows upon the judiciary a nondelegable power of the legislature in violation of the separation of powers provisions of the Arkansas Constitution. Robert D. Holloway, Inc. v. Pine Ridge Addition Residential Property Owners, 332 Ark. 450, 966 S.W.2d 241 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant pointed to no rules of civil procedure which would conflict with the presumption of being uninsured created in former version of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.27.html#t27c19s27-19-503" target="_blank">27-19-503</a></cite> of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act by the Arkansas General Assembly, the section is not unconstitutional based on any separation of powers concerns. Throesch v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 100 F. Supp. 2d 934 (E.D. Ark. 2000), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 255 F.3d 551 (8th Cir. 2001).

Const., Art. 19, § 13 and, further, such an attempt violated the constitutional mandate requiring separation of powers set forth in this Article. Luebbers v. Money Store, Inc., 344 Ark. 232, 40 S.W.3d 745 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the casting of a vote by the legislator notwithstanding that, under
       <i>
        Matthews v. Bailey
       </i>
       , 198 Ark. 830, 131 S.W.2d 425 (1939), such a vote, if both decisive and defective, might have affected the validity of a contested enactment; pursuant to Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 11, the issue of whether the legislator was required to reside in the district from where he was elected was a matter to be determined by the Arkansas House of Representatives. Magnus v. Carr, 350 Ark. 388, 86 S.W.3d 867 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The system of funding the public school system in place between 1994 and 2000 violated the provisions of Ark. Const., Art. 14, § 1 and Art. 2, §§ 2, 3, and 18, but it was the responsibility of the General Assembly and not the judiciary to create a system that complied with those constitutional requirements. Lake View Sch. Dist. No. 25 v. Huckabee, 351 Ark. 31, 91 S.W.3d 472 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">538 U.S. 1035</cite>, <cite class="s_court">123 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Child Agency Review Board violated the separation of powers doctrine and exceeded the authority given to it by the Arkansas General Assembly when it promulgated § 200.3.2 of the Minimum Licensing Standards for Child Welfare Agencies, which prohibited persons with adult homosexual members in their household from becoming foster parents; although the Board was required to promulgate regulations to protect the health, safety, and welfare of foster children, there was no evidence that living with an adult homosexual placed foster children in danger and the Board was not required to issue regulations based upon moral standards or beliefs. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Howard, 367 Ark. 55, 238 S.W.3d 1 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegedly injured driver brought suit against another motorist, who then brought suit against a third party; the jury determined that the third party was 100 percent at fault. The allegedly injured driver attacked the constitutionality of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c55s16-55-201" target="_blank">16-55-201</a></cite> and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c55s16-55-212" target="_blank">16-55-212</a></cite>, alleging that Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 3, mandated the supreme court to prescribe all rules of procedure, and that the legislature could not infringe on this power because such an infringement would violate this section and Ark. Const., Art. 4, § 2; however, the matter was moot because any decision by the supreme court would have no practical effect on the case.
   Shipp v. Franklin, 370 Ark. 262, 258 S.W.3d 744 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' compensation claimant failed to demonstrate a violation of the separation of powers doctrine on the part of any private interest by the procedure used by the Workers'
   Compensation Commission because it was impossible to do so, as the doctrine dealt solely with the relationship of the three branches of government, and placed no limits whatsoever on private citizens. The claimant failed to assert that the judiciary either assigned or allowed tasks that were more properly accomplished by other branches of the government; neither of the affidavits of former administrative law judges contained any factual violations regarding their judicial independence or integrity caused by the executive branch of the State of Arkansas, and to the contrary, they both asserted that just the opposite was true.
   Long v. Wal-Mart Stores, 98 Ark. App. 70, 250 S.W.3d 263 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court declared the entirety of the Method of Execution Act of 2009 unconstitutional. The legislature abdicated its responsibility and passed to the Department of Correction the unfettered discretion to determine all protocol and procedures, most notably the chemicals to be used, for a state execution.
   Hobbs v. Jones, 2012 Ark. 293, 412 S.W.3d 844 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the separation of powers doctrine, the State Board of Election Commissioners lacked authority to establish a procedure for absentee voters where the General Assembly had provided a method by which an in-person voter could have cured any failure to provide proof of identity, did not provide a similar method for absentee voters, and although the Board had authority to promulgate rules to assure fair and orderly election procedures, it lacked authority to create election procedures.
   Ark. State Bd. of Election Comm'rs v. Pulaski County Election Comm'n, 2014 Ark. 236, 437 S.W.3d 80 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2013, No. 139 did not violate separation of powers by delegating to the Department of Correction power to select a barbiturate to use in lethal injections because Act 139 gave guidance on how to carry out the death penalty, drugs to be used, the order in which to administer the drugs, how much to administer, and the policy for carrying out the death penalty; thus, reasonable guidelines bounded Act 139’s delegation of authority.
   Hobbs v. McGehee, 2015 Ark. 116, 458 S.W.3d 707 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2013, No. 139 was not unconstitutional for not stating qualifications of those involved in lethal injections because such level of detail was not constitutionally required.

   Protect Fayetteville v. City of Fayetteville, 2019 Ark. 28, 566 S.W.3d 105 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court erred in denying the State's motions for a protective order and to quash the subpoenas served on two state legislators because the Speech and Debate Clause affords legislators privilege from certain discovery and testimony and the privilege extends beyond statements and acts made on the literal floor of the House; and the Arkansas Constitution provides for the executive privilege in the separation-of-powers provisions.

       Trial court properly dismissed the complaint with prejudice because the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.04.html#t04c88s4-88-101" target="_blank">4-88-101</a></cite> et seq., did not apply to the practice of law, and the Arkansas Supreme Court made rules regulating the practice of law and that responsibility could not be discharged if it were dependent upon or controlled by statutes enacted by the Arkansas General Assembly; the attorney agreed to represent the husband in the medical malpractice action, which was dismissed with prejudice because the attorney was not authorized to practice law in Arkansas.
   Preston v. Stoops, 373 Ark. 591, 285 S.W.3d 606 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>

       Circuit court violated the separation of powers doctrine under this section and Ark.

       Neither of the three separate departments of government is subordinate to the other and neither can arrogate to itself any control over either one of the others in matters which have been confided by the constitution to such other department; the Legislature, under the separation of powers, can neither be coerced nor controlled by judicial power such as a writ of mandamus.

       In a civil forfeiture proceeding, an owner was not entitled to have a default judgment entered in favor of the state set aside based on substantial compliance because the judgment was not void since the summons was sufficient; moreover, the owner failed to present a meritorious defense.

       Certain duties not essentially judicial may be imposed upon judges in those cases where, by the Constitution, such duties do not inhere in another department of the government, but authority set aside to the executive department cannot be delegated to judges.

       The legislature has no right to delegate the lawmaking power to commissions and boards established by the legislature, but may delegate the power to determine facts upon which the law makes or intends to make its action depend, and general provisions may be set forth with power given to those who are to act under such general provisions to complete the details.

      </p>
      <p>
       Empowering the Governor to appoint special Public Service Commission commissioners, without senate approval, is a valid delegation of authority by the legislature to the branch of government that is equipped to execute and implement legislative mandates, therefore, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.23.html#t23c02s23-2-102ol1a" target="_blank">23-2-102(a)</a></cite> passes constitutional muster.

       Workers' compensation claimant failed to demonstrate a violation of the separation of powers doctrine on the part of any private interest by the procedure used by the Workers'
   Compensation Commission because it was impossible to do so, as the doctrine dealt solely with the relationship of the three branches of government, and placed no limits whatsoever on private citizens. The claimant failed to assert that the judiciary either assigned or allowed tasks that were more properly accomplished by other branches of the government; neither of the affidavits of former administrative law judges contained any factual violations regarding their judicial independence or integrity caused by the executive branch of the State of Arkansas, and to the contrary, they both asserted that just the opposite was true.

       Supreme Court declared the entirety of the Method of Execution Act of 2009 unconstitutional.

      <p>
       Acts 2013, No. 139 did not violate separation of powers by delegating to the Department of Correction power to select a barbiturate to use in lethal injections because Act 139 gave guidance on how to carry out the death penalty, drugs to be used, the order in which to administer the drugs, how much to administer, and the policy for carrying out the death penalty; thus, reasonable guidelines bounded Act 139’s delegation of authority.

Const. Amend. 80, § 3, because rules regarding the admissibility of evidence were within the province of the supreme court.
   Thomas v. Rockwell Automation, Inc., 2009 Ark. 241, 308 S.W.3d 135 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 16-55-202 was unconstitutional and conflicted with this section and Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 3, because rules regarding pleading, practice, and procedure were solely the responsibility of the supreme court; the nonparty-fault provision bypassed the rules of pleading, practice, and procedure by setting up a procedure to determine the fault of a nonparty and mandating the consideration of that nonparty's fault in an effort to reduce a plaintiff's recovery.

       The seat-belt statute, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.27.html#t27c37s27-37-703" target="_blank">27-37-703</a></cite>, is procedural and therefore offends the principle of separation of powers and the powers specifically prescribed to the Supreme Court of Arkansas by Ark. Const. Amend. 80. Accordingly, in response to a certified question from the federal district court, the Supreme Court holds that § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.27.html#t27c37s27-37-703" target="_blank">27-37-703</a></cite> violates separation of powers under Ark. Const., Art. 4, § 2, and Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 3, and is therefore unconstitutional.

       The party alleging that legislation is arbitrary has the burden of proving that there is no rational basis for the legislative act and, regardless of the evidence introduced by the moving party, the legislation is presumed to be valid and is to be upheld if the judicial branch finds a rational basis for it; it is not for the judicial branch to decide from evidence introduced by the moving party whether the legislative branch acted wisely.

       § 1. Initiative and Referendum.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative power of the people of this State shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of the Senate and House of Representatives, but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose legislative measures, laws and amendments to the Constitution, and to enact or reject the same at the polls independent of the General Assembly; and also reserve the power, at their own option to approve or reject at the polls any entire act or any item of an appropriation bill.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Initiative.
      </b>
      The first power reserved by the people is the initiative. Eight per cent of the legal voters may propose any law and ten per cent may propose a constitutional amendment by initiative petition and every such petition shall include the full text of the measure so proposed. Initiative petitions for state-wide measures shall be filed with the Secretary of State not less than four months before the election at which they are to be voted upon; provided, that at least thirty days before the aforementioned filing, the proposed measure shall have been published once, at the expense of the petitioners, in some paper of general circulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Referendum.
      </b>
      The second power reserved by the people is the referendum, and any number not less than six per cent of the legal voters may, by petition, order the referendum against any general Act, or any item of an appropriation bill, or measure passed by the General Assembly, but the filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections or parts of any such act or measure shall not delay the remainder from becoming operative. Such petition shall be filed with the Secretary of State not later than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session at which such Act was passed, except when a recess or adjournment shall be taken temporarily for a longer period than ninety days, in which case such petition shall be filed not later than ninety days after such recess or temporary adjournment. Any measure referred to the people by referendum petition shall remain in abeyance until such vote is taken. The total number of votes cast for the office of Governor in the last preceding general election shall be the basis upon which the number of signatures of legal voters upon state-wide initiative and referendum petitions shall be computed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon all initiative or referendum petitions provided for in any of the sections of this article, it shall be necessary to file from at least fifteen of the counties of the State, petitions bearing the signature of not less than one-half of the designated percentage of the electors of such county.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Emergency.
      </b>
      If it shall be necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety that a measure shall become effective without delay, such necessity shall be stated in one section, and if upon a yea and nay vote two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, or two-thirds of all the members elected to city or town councils, shall vote upon separate roll call in favor of the measure going into immediate operation, such emergency measure shall become effective without delay. It shall be necessary, however, to state the fact which constitutes such emergency. Provided, however, that an emergency shall not be declared on any franchise or special privilege or act creating any vested right or interest or alienating any property of the State. If a referendum is filed against any emergency measure such measure shall be a law until it is voted upon by the people, and if it is then rejected by a majority of the electors voting thereon, it shall be thereby repealed. The provision of this sub-section shall apply to city or town councils.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Local for Municipalities and Counties.
      </b>
      The initiative and referendum powers of the people are hereby further reserved to the legal voters of each municipality and county as to all local, special and municipal legislation of every character in and for their respective municipalities and counties, but no local legislation shall be enacted contrary to the Constitution or any general law of the State, and any general law shall have the effect of repealing any local legislation which is in conflict therewith.
     </p>
     <p>
      Municipalities may provide for the exercise of the initiative and referendum as to their local legislation. General laws shall be enacted providing for the exercise of the initiative and referendum as to counties. Fifteen per cent of the legal voters of any municipality or county may order the referendum, or invoke the initiative upon any local measure. In municipalities the number of signatures required upon any petition shall be computed upon the total vote cast for the office of mayor at the last preceding general election; in counties upon the office of circuit clerk. In municipalities and counties the time for filing an initiative petition shall not be fixed at less than sixty days nor more than ninety days before the election at which it is to be voted upon; for a referendum petition at not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days after the passage of such measure by a municipal council; nor less than ninety days when filed against a local or special measure passed by the General Assembly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every extension, enlargement, grant, or conveyance of a franchise or any rights, property, easement, lease, or occupation of or in any road, street, alley or any part thereof in real property or interest in real property owned by municipalities, exceeding in value three hundred dollars, whether the same be by statute, ordinance, resolution, or otherwise, shall be subject to referendum and shall not be subject to emergency legislation.

      Any measure submitted to the people as herein provided shall take effect and become a law when approved by a majority of the votes cast upon such measure, and not otherwise, and shall not be required to receive a majority of the electors voting at such election. Such measures shall be operative on and after the thirtieth day after the election at which it is approved, unless otherwise specified in the Act.

      At the time of filing petitions the exact title to be used on the ballot shall by the petitioners be submitted with the petition, and on state-wide measures, shall be submitted to the State Board of Election Commissioners, who shall certify such title to the Secretary of State, to be placed upon the ballot; on county and municipal measures such title shall be submitted to the county election board and shall by said board be placed upon the ballot in such county or municipal election.

      <b>
       Limitation.
      </b>
      No limitation shall be placed upon the number of constitutional amendments, laws, or other measures which may be proposed and submitted to the people by either initiative or referendum petition as provided in this section.

      <b>
       Verification.
      </b>
      Only legal votes shall be counted upon petitions. Petitions may be circulated and presented in parts, but each part of any petition shall have attached thereto the affidavit of the person circulating the same, that all signatures thereon were made in the presence of the affiant, and that to the best of the affiant's knowledge and belief each signature is genuine, and that the person signing is a legal voter and no other affidavit or verification shall be required to establish the genuineness of such signatures.

      <b>
       Sufficiency.

      The sufficiency of all state-wide petitions shall be decided in the first instance by the Secretary of State, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the State, which shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all such causes. The sufficiency of all local petitions shall be decided in the first instance by the county clerk or the city clerk as the case may be, subject to review by the chancery court.

      <b>
       Court Decisions.
      </b>
      If the sufficiency of any petition is challenged such cause shall be a preference cause and shall be tried at once, but the failure of the courts to decide prior to the election as to the sufficiency of any such petition, shall not prevent the question from being placed upon the ballot at the election named in such petition, nor militate against the validity of such measure, if it shall have been approved by a vote of the people.

       Publisher's Notes.
      </b>
      The original language of this section was “The legislative power of this State shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of the Senate and House of Representatives.” An earlier amendment in 1910 to this section was superseded by Ark. Const. Amend. 7. See Acts 1909, p. 1238.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article 5, sec. 1, of Amendment 7, provided: “This amendment to the Constitution of the State be, and the same shall be in substitution of the Initiative and Referendum Amendment, approved February 19, 1909, as the same appears in the Acts of Arkansas for 1909, on pages 1239 and 1240 of the volume containing the same; and that the said amendment (and the Act of the General Assembly to carry out the same, approved June 30, 1911, so far as the same is in conflict herewith), be and the same are hereby repealed.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The amendment to this section by Amendment 7 was adopted at the general election of Nov. 2, 1920, by a vote of 86,360 for and 43,662 against. It was declared lost by the Speaker of the House on Jan. 15, 1921, but was declared adopted in Brickhouse v. Hill, 167 Ark. 513, 268 S.W. 865 (1925).
     </p>
     <p>
      Ark. Const. Amend. 93, which amended this section, was proposed by S.J.R. 16 during the 2013 Regular Session and adopted at the November 2014 general election by a vote of 425,709 for and 372,784 against. The amendment was effective thirty days after the election pursuant to § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.07.html#t07c09s7-9-119" target="_blank">7-9-119</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before the amendment by Amendment 93, the subsection of this section titled “Amendment of Petition” read: “If the Secretary of State, county clerk or city clerk, as the case may be, shall decide any petition to be insufficient, he shall without delay notify the sponsers of such petition, and permit at least thirty days from the date of such notification, in the instance of a state-wide petition, or ten days in the instance of a municipal or county petition, for correction or amendment. In the event of legal proceedings to prevent giving legal effect to any petition upon any grounds, the burden of proof shall be upon the person or persons attacking the validity of the petition.”

       The initiative or referendum does not abrogate the existing Constitution and laws of the state except such provisions as are necessarily repugnant thereto. Hodges v. Dawdy, 104 Ark. 583, 149 S.W. 656 (1912) (decision under prior Constitutional provision).
      </p>
      <p>
       The choice of how Amendment 7 [this section] is to be implemented to meet new conditions rests with the legislature, not with the courts. Czech v. Munson, 280 Ark. 219, 656 S.W.2d 696 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court will make a more detailed examination and analysis of the proposed ballot title than it does the popular name. The popular name is designed primarily to identify the proposal, while the ballot title is designed to adequately summarize the provisions of the proposal and be complete enough to convey to the voter an intelligible idea of the scope and import of the proposal. Ferstl v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 504, 758 S.W.2d 398 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is not how the members of the court feel concerning the wisdom of a proposed amendment, but rather whether the requirements for submission of the proposal to the voters have been met. It is the function of the court to see that the ballot title (and popular name) are: (1) intelligible, (2) honest, and (3) impartial. Ferstl v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 504, 758 S.W.2d 398 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendment 7’s [this section's] reservation to the people of the initiative power lies at the heart of our democratic institutions. Christian Civic Action Comm. v. McCuen, 318 Ark. 241, 884 S.W.2d 605 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Until appropriate legislative action is taken to correct the problems attendant to proposals submitted under Amendment 7 [this section], citizens can continue to expect measures to be removed from the ballot immediately prior to the election; the people of Arkansas deserve an initiative and referendum procedure which allows them the confidence that measures, after having been adequately reviewed, will not be removed from the ballot. The sponsors of initiative proposals should also be assured their ballot titles and proposed measures meet required guidelines and rules before they spend their time, energy, and monies in getting their proposal before the voters. Page v. McCuen, 318 Ark. 342, 884 S.W.2d 951 (1994).

       Amendment 7 [this section] should be liberally construed in order to meet the purposes for which it was adopted. Gregg v. Hartwick, 292 Ark. 528, 731 S.W.2d 766 (1987); Plugge v. McCuen, 310 Ark. 654, 841 S.W.2d 139 (1992), overruled in part, Bailey v. McCuen, 318 Ark. 277, 884 S.W.2d 938 (1994); Porter v. McCuen, 310 Ark. 674, 839 S.W.2d 521 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the sufficiency of a ballot title, the Supreme Court will give a liberal construction and interpretation of the requirements of Amendment 7 [this section] in order to secure its purposes to reserve to the people the right to adopt, reject, approve, or disapprove legislation. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In common legal parlance, a “bill” is a draft of an act of the legislature before it becomes law; under Amendment 7 [this section], the people of this state have the power to enact “bills” into laws by direct vote, and the term “bills,” as used in the enacting clause section of Amendment 7 [this section], does not refer to statewide constitutional amendments but only to initiated proposals where the people are seeking to enact their own laws. United States Term Limits, Inc. v. Hill, 316 Ark. 251, 872 S.W.2d 349 (1994), aff'd, sub nom. United States Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 779</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1842</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 881 (1995).

       This section, in its present form, does not afford leeway for innovative case interpretations of substantial compliance; its language is clear that the provision shall be treated as mandatory. Mertz v. States, 318 Ark. 390, 885 S.W.2d 853 (1994).

       Proposed amendment regarding congressional term limits was procedural in nature, purporting to empower the electorate with an indirect and prohibited means to propose an amendment to the United States Constitution; such a procedure is not encompassed within the initiative powers reserved to the people of this state in this section.

       Appellate review of the sufficiency of a proposed measure includes a review of whether the measure's proponents are entitled to invoke the direct initiative process when such issue is properly presented. Donovan v. Priest, 326 Ark. 353, 931 S.W.2d 119 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1149</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1081</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Substantive constitutional challenges differ from procedural challenges in that the former necessarily involve fact-specific issues and, thus, are not ripe for review until the proposed measure becomes law and a case in controversy arises. Donovan v. Priest, 326 Ark. 353, 931 S.W.2d 119 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1149</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1081</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 216 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantive constitutional challenges to a proposed measure raised issues that were not ripe for review, and hypothetical scenarios asserted by the measure's opponents did not show that the act, if passed, would clearly conflict with any constitutional provisions or that it was clearly contrary to any state or federal laws.

       In addition to identification of the measure the ballot title must be (1) intelligible, (2) honest, and (3) impartial. Shepard v. McDonald, 189 Ark. 29, 70 S.W.2d 566 (1934); Bailey v. Hall, 198 Ark. 815, 131 S.W.2d 635 (1939); Sturdy v. Hall, 204 Ark. 785, 164 S.W.2d 884 (1942); Hoban v. Hall, 229 Ark. 416, 316 S.W.2d 185 (1958); Leigh v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The title of the act may be used as the ballot title if it fairly alleges the general purpose of the act. Coleman v. Sherrill, 189 Ark. 843, 75 S.W.2d 248 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute requiring submission to Attorney General of ballot title of act upon which referendum is proposed at the time the petition is submitted before circulation of the petition in no way curtails the operation of Amendment 7 [this section]. Washburn v. Hall, 225 Ark. 868, 286 S.W.2d 494 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no language in Amendment 7 [this section] pertaining to ballot titles for legislative proposals of constitutional amendments. Chaney v. Bryant, 259 Ark. 294, 532 S.W.2d 741 (1976); Becker v. Riviere, 277 Ark. 252, 641 S.W.2d 2 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       While neither the length nor complexity of the ballot title of a proposed constitutional amendment should be a controlling factor in determining the sufficiency of the ballot title, it is a consideration since the great majority of voters will derive their information about the amendment from the ballot title. Dust v. Riviere, 277 Ark. 1, 638 S.W.2d 663 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is difficult to prepare a perfect ballot title; it is sufficient if it informs the voters with such clarity that they can cast their ballot with a fair understanding of the issue presented. Ferstl v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 504, 758 S.W.2d 398 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A ballot title, like the popular name, must be intelligible, honest, and impartial. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ballot title need not recite all of the details of the proposal; however, if the information would give the elector “serious ground for reflection,” it is not a mere detail and must be disclosed. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ballot title must accurately reflect the general purposes and fundamental provisions of the proposed initiative so that an elector does not vote for a proposal based on its description in the ballot title when, in fact, the vote is for a position he might oppose. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proposed lottery amendment ballot title held to be insufficient. Finn v. McCuen, 303 Ark. 418, 798 S.W.2d 34 (1990), overruled in part, Stilley v. Priest, 341 Ark. 329, 16 S.W.3d 251 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Ark. Const., Art. 19, § 22, the standard of review applied to ballot titles is: (1) whether the ballot title is sufficient to “distinguish and identify” the proposal, and (2) whether the ballot title is a “manifest fraud upon the public.” This is a different and less demanding standard than the standard applicable to initiatives under Amendment 7 [this section]. Becker v. McCuen, 303 Ark. 482, 798 S.W.2d 71 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ballot title is not required to be perfect, nor is it reasonable to expect the title to cover or anticipate every possible legal argument the proposed measure might evoke. Plugge v. McCuen, 310 Ark. 654, 841 S.W.2d 139 (1992), overruled in part, Bailey v. McCuen, 318 Ark. 277, 884 S.W.2d 938 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ballot title must be free from any misleading tendency, whether by amplification, omission, or fallacy; it must not be tinged with partisan coloring. Ferstl v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 504, 758 S.W.2d 398 (1988); Plugge v. McCuen, 310 Ark. 654, 841 S.W.2d 139 (1992), overruled in part, Bailey v. McCuen, 318 Ark. 277, 884 S.W.2d 938 (1994).

       A ballot title must convey an intelligible idea of the scope and significance of a proposed change in the law. Christian Civic Action Comm. v. McCuen, 318 Ark. 241, 884 S.W.2d 605 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ballot title of a measure was sufficient under this section of Article 5 because the title, although lengthy, informed the voters in an intelligible, honest, and impartial manner of the substantive matter of the act. The title was not unduly long or misleading, and it did not have to include every detail, term, definition, or possible consequence of the act.
   Cox v. Martin, 2012 Ark. 352, 423 S.W.3d 75 (2012).

       The Supreme Court has slightly different standards of review depending on whether the allegation made is that information is omitted from the ballot title or that statements in the title are misleading: if the omitted information would, if included, give the voter serious ground for reflection on how to vote, this is a material omission and the ballot title is fatally deficient, on the other hand, if the statements contained in the ballot title have a tendency to mislead the voter so as to thwart a fair understanding of the issues presented, the ballot title is likewise insufficient.

       The phrase fixing the time for filing a referendum petition on municipal ordinances at “not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days after the passage of such measure by a municipal council” does not mean that a referendum petition cannot be filed less than 30 days after passage of the measure, but that the city must allow at least 30 days for the filing of such petition.

       Popular name proposed for constitutional amendment “act to repeal the full crew laws” was not misleading since the acts that it proposed to repeal are generally known as full crew laws and the term full crew law is defined in the dictionary. Hope v. Hall, 229 Ark. 407, 316 S.W.2d 199 (1958).

       The popular name of the “Arkansas Minimum Wage and Overtime Act” is not partisan, colored, or misleading. Leigh v. Hall, 232 Ark. 558, 339 S.W.2d 104 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Popular name of petition to legalize gambling in named county was not misleading in that it contained partisan coloring, superfluous words designed to solicit votes, and conveyed a false idea of the meaning and effect of the proposed act by use of “wagering” instead of “gambling,” there being no sound distinction between wagering and betting as forms of gambling.

       The popular name is designed to make it easy for voters to discuss the proposal prior to the election by giving them a label to identify it. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).

       The Supreme Court has declared popular names invalid because they were misleading or used biased language. However, because so little is required of a popular name, the court has never held a proposed measure invalid solely because of an incomplete description of the act by the popular name. Gaines v.

       Popular name of a measure was sufficient under this section of Article 5 (amended by Ark. Const. Amend. 7) because the phrase “medical marijuana” sufficiently conveyed to voters the topic of medicinal use of marijuana and was not misleading, partisan, or defective.

       Once a measure is referred to the people, regardless of whether it contains an emergency clause, any amendments made by the General Assembly during the referendum proceedings are held in abeyance; 1993 amendments passed by the General Assembly after the referendum proceedings began will not be considered when evaluating the sufficiency of the 1994 ballot title of the referred act.

        —Emergency Clause.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The amendment is self-executing and, although it is within the legislative discretion to determine that an emergency exists, that fact must be stated, as otherwise the act is subject to the operation of the amendment and, 90 days being given from the final adjournment in which to demand or order the referendum thereon, an act cannot take effect until 90 days after such adjournment. State ex rel. Ark. Tax Comm'n v. Moore, 103 Ark. 48, 145 S.W. 199 (1912) (decision under prior Constitutional provision).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a legislative act contains a valid emergency clause, it is effective from and after its passage and remains in force and effect until an adverse vote has been registered by the people in the manner provided by law. Hanson v. Hodges, 109 Ark. 479, 160 S.W. 392 (1913) (decision under prior Constitutional provision); Railey v. City of Magnolia, 197 Ark. 1047, 126 S.W.2d 273 (1939); Fulkerson v. Refunding Bd., 201 Ark. 957, 147 S.W.2d 980 (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the adoption of Amendment 7 [this section], the emergency clause was attached to almost all laws enacted and, to prevent this practice, requirement that facts constituting emergency be stated was inserted in the Constitution. Gentry v. Harrison, 194 Ark. 916, 110 S.W.2d 497 (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cases construing acts containing emergency clauses held insufficient. Gentry v. Harrison, 194 Ark. 916, 110 S.W.2d 497 (1937); Matthews v. Bailey, 198 Ark. 830, 131 S.W.2d 425 (1939); Cunningham v. Walker, 198 Ark. 928, 132 S.W.2d 24 (1939); Barber v. State, 206 Ark. 187, 174 S.W.2d 545 (1943); Marshall v. Singleton, 282 Ark. 167, 666 S.W.2d 399 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though emergency clause was not adopted for the reason that it did not receive the vote of two-thirds of the members of the House, as required by the Constitution, Supreme Court may read the emergency clause in determining the legislative intent in passing the bill. Missouri Pac. R.R. v. Kincannon, 203 Ark. 76, 156 S.W.2d 70 (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that everyone may not agree that the facts stated constitute an emergency is not the test of the validity of the emergency clause; the question is whether reasonable people might disagree. Mann v. Lowry, 227 Ark. 1132, 303 S.W.2d 889 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Emergency clause found sufficient. City of DeWitt v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 248 Ark. 285, 451 S.W.2d 188 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The courts will not disturb a finding by the General Assembly that a particular fact comprises an emergency if the fact is recited and if fair-minded and intelligent men might reasonably differ as to the sufficiency and truth of the recited fact as a basis for declaring an emergency. State v. Ziegenbein, 282 Ark. 162, 666 S.W.2d 698 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Emergency is defined as some sudden or unexpected happening that creates a need for action. Priest v. Polk, 322 Ark. 673, 912 S.W.2d 902 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the arguably archaic and obsolete nature of the Constitution of 1874 and its unsuitableness for piecemeal amendment, reasonable people might disagree as to whether the facts stated in the emergency clause concerning the need for a new constitution did state an emergency and, therefore, the appellate court upheld the emergency clause. Priest v. Polk, 322 Ark. 673, 912 S.W.2d 902 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Emergency clause of Acts 2019, No. 376 was defective where the stated basis was “to avoid confusion in petition circulation”; Act 376 added additional requirements for getting a referendum on the election ballot, and the prospect of affording those who seek to file a ballot petition additional notice of new requirements for that petition, especially when the people would not be voting on any such initiatives or referenda for at least another 15 months, did not amount to an emergency under Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 1.
   Safe Surgery Ark. v. Thurston, 2019 Ark. 403, 591 S.W.3d 293 (2019) (sub. op.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Emergency clause of Acts 2019, No. 376 was not responsive to some real-life circumstance making immediate legislative enactment “necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety”, and reasonable people could not disagree on this question; thus, the emergency clause was set aside.
   Safe Surgery Ark. v. Thurston, 2019 Ark. 403, 591 S.W.3d 293 (2019) (sub. op.).
      </p>
      <p>
       As the emergency clause of Acts 2019, No. 376 was ineffective and Act 376’s new requirements were not in effect at the time petitioner filed its proposed referendum and supporting signatures, mandamus was granted directing the Secretary of State to address petitioner's referendum filings (seeking a referendum on Acts 2019, No. 579) under the pre-Act 376 legal framework for initiatives and referenda.

       The one-year election district residency requirement imposed by this section on persons seeking election as senator or representative, which corresponds to durational requirements in other state constitutions and the Federal Constitution, is constitutional under both the “reasonable basis” test and the “compelling state interest” test. Brewster v. Johnson, 260 Ark. 450, 541 S.W.2d 306 (1976).

       A prospective candidate, who had been a student at a university in the district from 1972 through the summer term of 1976, was not a resident of the district for one year before the date of the election and was therefore not qualified to run as an independent candidate for representative of the district. Brewster v. Johnson, 260 Ark. 450, 541 S.W.2d 306 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       A candidate who did not physically reside in a certain district for the one year preceding an election did not satisfy the residency requirement, even though he testified that he thought of the district as his area of residence, worked in the district, had his child educated there, received mail at a post office there, and had other ties to the district. Jenkins v. Bogard, 335 Ark. 334, 980 S.W.2d 270 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires that a candidate reside in the legislative district for one year prior to election, not merely in the county. Valley v. Bogard, 342 Ark. 336, 28 S.W.3d 269 (2000).

       Candidate's post-election challenge to a state senate runoff election was properly brought within the circuit or district in which alleged voter fraud occurred; further, the secretary of state and the state democratic committee were not indispensable parties for complete relief under Ark. R. Civ. P. 19 because the office of state senator was not a “state office” as that term had been differentiated in §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.07.html#t07c07s7-7-401" target="_blank">7-7-401</a></cite> and <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.07.html#t07c05s7-5-804" target="_blank">7-5-804</a></cite>, and Ark.

       There are only two types of sessions of the General Assembly in Arkansas — the regular biennial sessions provided for in Ark. Const., Art. 5, §§ 5 and 17, and the sessions which the governor by proclamation convenes under Ark. Const., Art. 6, § 19, which have come to be known as special sessions. State ex rel. Purcell v.

       Although Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 17, provides that the General Assembly can, by a two-thirds vote, extend a regular session beyond the 60 days, such an extension should only be long enough to allow the General Assembly time to finish its legislative work on the matters pending before it at the regular session. Wells v. Riviere, 269 Ark. 156, 599 S.W.2d 375 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       A fair reading of the constitution cannot mean that the General Assembly can legally extend a session indefinitely for no valid legislative purpose, nor indefinitely go into a recess so that it may later reconvene itself and conduct its business as though it were in a regular session. Wells v. Riviere, 269 Ark. 156, 599 S.W.2d 375 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the General Assembly met in January of 1979 and adopted a resolution indefinitely extending its regular biennial session beyond the 60 days, where the assembly passed a resolution in April which stated that the assembly had completed its essential business and was recessing for 20 months until the next regular session in January of 1981, but that the assembly could reconvene at any time prior to that time, and where the assembly did reconvene in January of 1980 and proposed three amendments to the constitution, two of the three proposed amendments were invalid under Ark. Const., Art. 19, § 22, for not being proposed during a regular session because they were proposed for the first time during the reconvened session; however, the third proposed amendment was valid because it had been considered and worked on during the regular 60-day session in 1979.

        “Infamous Crime.”
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Arkansas case law has recognized that an “infamous crime” is a distinct entity and has never considered it to be synonymous with the term felony or required a punishment that exceeds imprisonment of one year; there is no support that the drafters of Ark. Const. art. 5, § 9, which deals with removal of an elected official from office, intended the term to be so narrowly construed, particularly in light of the fact that it is preceded by crimes specifically implicating elements of dishonesty or untruthfulness. State v. Oldner, 361 Ark. 316, 206 S.W.3d 818 (2005) (decision prior to 2016 amendment).

       Mayor was properly barred from being a candidate for re-election because the mayor was convicted of the theft of three campaign signs over a year earlier; the misdemeanor theft was a crime of dishonesty and was an infamous crime in the context of this section, which barred those convicted of such crimes from holding public office.

       Taxpayer showed a likelihood of success on the merits of the taxpayer's claim that a police chief was disqualified because (1) this section applied to appointed officials and to the office of chief of police, as the office was an “office of trust”, and (2) the chief's conviction for giving a false report to a police officer was an “infamous crime” of dishonesty committed with intent to deceive.

       Circuit court did not clearly err in determining that a registered voter had established by a preponderance of the evidence that a circuit court judge candidate had pleaded guilty to and been convicted of violations of the Arkansas Hot Check Law, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c37s5-37-301" target="_blank">5-37-301</a></cite> et seq., where it required the voter to demonstrate that he had a clear and certain right to the disqualification of the candidate, thereby correctly applying the burden of proof. The candidate also failed to present documentary evidence to contradict the certified court records and admitted that he was 25 years old at the time, which was consistent with the certified court record.

       Where the mayor was convicted of abuse of office for using city funds to pave a parking lot on property owned by his family and witness tampering for requesting that two city employees fabricate testimony in order to cover up alleged wrongdoing on his part, those crimes were of a type that directly impacted the mayor's moral integrity because they were crimes involving dishonesty and deceit; therefore, the mayor's convictions were “infamous crimes” and the trial court's order denying the state's petition to remove the mayor from office was reversed.

       When the State of Arkansas sought a sheriff's removal from office based on the sheriff's prior conviction of misdemeanor theft, it was error for a trial court to hold that, in addition to proving the sheriff committed an “infamous crime,” the state had to prove the crime impugned the integrity of the sheriff's office or directly impacted his ability to serve because, once it was determined that the sheriff had committed an “infamous crime,” the sheriff was barred from public office.

       The chairman and secretary of a party's state committee have no right to exclude the name of a candidate for State Senator who has complied with the prescribed rules because, in their opinion, he is ineligible and could not hold the office, whether that ineligibility arose out of a conviction for a felony or any other cause which would render him ineligible.

Each member of the General Assembly shall also receive ten cents per mile for each mile traveled in going to and returning from the seat of government, over the most direct and practicable route. When convened in extraordinary session by the Governor, they shall each receive three dollars per day for their services during the first fifteen days, and if such extraordinary session shall extend beyond fifteen days, they shall receive no further per diem. They shall be entitled to the same mileage for any extraordinary session as herein provided for regular sessions.

       The Uniform Rules of Evidence (Acts 1975 (Extended Sess., 1976), No. 1143, § 1, p. 2799) were not validly adopted by the Legislature because, at the time of their adoption, the Legislature was unlawfully in session in January, 1976, almost a year after the 1975 regular session had ended; therefore, they did not become law.

      Each house, at the beginning of every regular session of the General Assembly, and whenever a vacancy may occur, shall elect from its members a presiding officer, to be styled, respectively, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives; and whenever, at the close of any session, it may appear that the term of the member elected President of the Senate will expire before the next regular session, the Senate shall elect another President from those members whose terms of office continue over, who shall qualify and remain President of the Senate until his successor may be elected and qualified; and who, in the case of a vacancy in the office of Governor, shall perform the duties and exercise the powers of Governor as elsewhere herein provided.

       A statute is not void because it has the enacting clause set out in this section and also the one provided in the initiative and referendum amendment; the inappropriate one will be disregarded. Jackson v. State, 101 Ark. 473, 142 S.W. 1153 (1912).

       The enacting clause provided in the initiative and referendum amendment is a substantial compliance with the section. Adcock v. Coker, 105 Ark. 210, 151 S.W. 253 (1912); King v. McDowell, 107 Ark. 381, 155 S.W. 501 (1913).

       This section is not merely declaratory that the state may not be sued without her consent but expressly forbids all suits against the state. Pitcock v. State, 91 Ark. 527, 121 S.W. 742 (1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any suit, whether in law or in equity, which has for its purpose and effect, directly or indirectly, of coercing the state is one against the state. Watson v. Dodge, 187 Ark. 1055, 63 S.W.2d 993 (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of whether a particular lawsuit is one against the state need not be determined solely by reference to the nominal parties to the record and the mere fact that the state is not named as a party defendant does not conclusively establish that the suit is not within the rule prohibiting suits agaist a sovereign without its consent. Ralls v. Mittlesteadt, 268 Ark. 741, 596 S.W.2d 349 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section prohibits awards of damages in lawsuits against the State of Arkansas and its institutions. Smith v. Denton, 320 Ark. 253, 895 S.W.2d 550 (1995).

      <p>

       Supreme Court of Arkansas concludes that the legislative waiver of sovereign immunity in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.11.html#t11c04s11-4-218ol1e" target="_blank">11-4-218(e)</a></cite> is repugnant to Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 20. In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court interprets the constitutional provision, “The State of Arkansas shall never be made a defendant in any of her courts”, precisely as it reads. The drafters of the current constitution removed language from the 1868 constitution that provided the General Assembly with statutory authority to waive sovereign immunity and instead used the word “never”. The people of the State of Arkansas approved this change when ratifying the current constitution. The General Assembly does not have the power to override a constitutional provision. To the extent § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.11.html#t11c04s11-4-218ol1e" target="_blank">11-4-218(e)</a></cite> directly contradicts the constitution, it must fail.

       Where a bill that had as its sole purpose the creation of a tax credit for dependents was amended by deleting the original purpose and substituting language assessing a tax surcharge against those residents of school districts with a millage rate below 25 miles, there was a violation of the constitutional prohibition against altering a bill so “as to change its original purpose.” Barclay v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption of validity of a legislative act signed by the Governor as originally introduced and then deposited with the Secretary of State is not overcome by the fact that the bill was amended by the house or because house and senate journals merely noted passage of the bill without mentioning amendment.

       Where a bill passed by the House was transmitted to the Senate where it was referred to a committee after two readings, and while there pending it was recalled by the House for reconsideration and subsequently passed a second time, whereupon it was returned to the Senate, read for a third time and passed, was held that there was compliance with the first clause of this section. State v. Crawford, 35 Ark. 237 (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements as to reading were to prevent hasty legislation by giving members time to inform themselves. The reading may be by title only or dispensed with upon a suspension of the rules, which will be presumed for the purpose of upholding a law; in addition, the bill may be read in both branches on the same day.

      <p>
       The Constitution of 1868 contained a provision similar to that found in this clause; thus, it was held that a bill did not become a law where the house journal showed the number of votes given on its final passage in the affirmative and in the negative, and the names of those voting in the affirmative, but there was no entry of the names of those who voted in the negative. Smithee v. Garth, 33 Ark. 17 (1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mandatory provisions that vote be taken by yeas and nays refers only to vote on passage of bills and is not required when one branch after regular passage of the bill passes upon amendments made in the other branch. State v. Corbett, 61 Ark. 226, 32 S.W. 686 (1895); State v. Crowe, 130 Ark. 272, 197 S.W. 4 (1917).

       Acts 1995, No. 739, did not violate this section as the act distinctly states that it is intended to accomplish the purpose of increasing tourism, recreation, and economic development by defraying the cost of construction and equipping a civic center. McCutchen v. Huckabee, 328 Ark. 202, 943 S.W.2d 225 (1997).

      <p>
       Even if the Supreme Court of Arkansas were to look to an act's emergency clause for its distinct purpose, boilerplate language in an emergency clause that says that the appropriation is “essential to the operation of the agency” is too broad and vague to meet the test of distinctly explaining “how” the money is to be spent.
   Wilson v. Weiss, 370 Ark. 205, 258 S.W.3d 351 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain acts of the General Assembly violated this section by not including a “distinct purpose” that stated the purpose of each act; the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that the mere statement in the acts that the challenged acts were to be used for “state assistance” or “state aid” did not explain “how” the funds would be used and the circuit court's rulings that the acts were constitutional were reversed.
   Wilson v. Weiss, 370 Ark. 205, 258 S.W.3d 351 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plain language of this section requires the purpose of the appropriation to be distinctly stated in the bill itself. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded on this point and did not address appellant's factual allegations because the 2015 acts at issue were facially unconstitutional.

       The purpose of constitutional provisions such as this to prevent the inclusion of separate and unrelated appropriations in a single bill because that practice opens the door to the evils that have come to be known as logrolling and pork barrel legislation.

       If this provision is a mandate for the legislature always to adopt such a general appropriation bill, it is not self-executing so far as the legislature is concerned, but the Constitution self-executes it. Smith v. Page, 192 Ark. 342, 91 S.W.2d 281 (1936).

       The unity of the subject of an appropriation is not broken by appropriating several sums for several specific objects which are necessary or convenient or tend to the accomplishment of one general design, notwithstanding other purposes than the main design may be thereby subserved. State v. Sloan, 66 Ark. 575, 53 S.W. 47 (1899); Vincenheller v. Reagan, 69 Ark. 460, 64 S.W. 278 (1901); Johnson v. Johnson, 84 Ark. 307, 105 S.W. 869 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       A general appropriation bill containing at least 24 separate and unrelated appropriations is contrary to this article and thus unconstitutional in its entirety. Cottrell v. Faubus, 233 Ark. 721, 347 S.W.2d 52 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The objection that the statute contained more than one subject contrary to this section in that it has to do with construction and maintenance of roads and highways was settled in view of the court's opinion that, had any power conferred or duty enjoined upon the Highway Commission been left out, the construction of roads and highways in this state would have been delayed. Hooker v. Parkin, 235 Ark. 218, 357 S.W.2d 534 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of the statute providing for compensation to attorneys in collateral proceedings did not fall within the subject matter of the bill and were invalid; however, because the severability clause was valid, the remainder of the appropriations would still stand. Reid v. Jones, 261 Ark. 550, 551 S.W.2d 191 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of an act, the effect of which was to transfer Cleveland County from one judicial district to another, violated this section because the act was an appropriation bill for the judicial retirement system, and appropriation bills are limited to one subject. Clinton v. Taylor, 284 Ark. 238, 681 S.W.2d 338 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appropriations act dealing with one subject, funding for personal services and operating expenses of the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD), did not violate the provisions of this section, although the act also contained provisions establishing agency powers and duties, salary limits, numbers of authorized personnel, overtime pay, uniform and tool allowance, and moving expenses, which are not merely appropriations in nature, but relate to administration of the AHTD. Ark. Motor Carriers Ass'n v. Pritchett, 303 Ark. 620, 798 S.W.2d 918 (1990).

       Although this section provides that no appropriation shall be made except for “defraying the necessary expenses of government” and the legislature has the exclusive right to determine what is necessary, there is no conflict between this section and Ark.

This section and Ark. Const. Amend. 35 are not irreconcilable; Ark. Const.

       Where the final passage by the house of a proposed constitutional amendment affecting the provisions of this section did not reflect an unrecorded amendment adopted by viva voce vote, the house and senate versions of the proposed amendment differed, the requirements of Ark.

       Court granted plaintiff's motion challenging the Arkansas Civil Justice Reform Act of 2003, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c55s16-55-212ol1b" target="_blank">16-55-212(b)</a></cite>, and allowed plaintiff to introduce evidence of the amounts billed to her for medical services necessitated by the injuries that were the subject of her lawsuit, regardless of any discount that she had received on those amounts because (1) if the Arkansas Supreme Court were considering the constitutionality of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c55s16-55-212ol1b" target="_blank">16-55-212(b)</a></cite>, it would hold that § 16-55-212(b) infringed on its constitutional prerogative to prescribe rules of evidence under Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 3, and was, therefore, unconstitutional because § 16-55-212(b) would, if enforced, work a reversal of the collateral source rule that had been recognized and approved by the Arkansas Supreme Court, yet the Arkansas Supreme Court did not “prescribe” § 16-55-212(b), and (2) the Arkansas Supreme Court would, if presented with the instant motion, find that § 16-55-212(b) violated this section as the Arkansas Supreme Court had held that a personal injury plaintiff was entitled, assuming a successful showing of liability, to recover the payments made (or written off) on her behalf by a collateral source, but § 16-55-212(b) would prevent her from doing that.

       The language referring to “highest number of votes” in this section, relating to the election of executive officers, does not mean merely that person with the lowest number of votes may not be declared elected as the phrase is distinctly different from the phrase “majority of the votes cast” when considered in the light of the constitutional provision.

       The runoff election is not considered a continuation of the general election or part of it, made necessary by the reason of the possible failure of any candidate to receive a majority vote, since this article authorizes the election to the named offices by plurality vote, without mentioning any requirement of popular election by majority vote.

If any bill shall not be returned by the Governor within five days, Sundays excepted, after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it; unless the General Assembly, by their adjournment, prevent its return; in which case it shall become a law, unless he shall file the same, with his objections, in the office of the Secretary of State, and give notice thereof, by public proclamation, within twenty days after such adjournment.

      In all criminal and penal cases, except in those of treason and impeachment, the Governor shall have power to grant reprieves, commutations of sentence, and pardons, after conviction; and to remit fines and forfeitures, under such rules and regulations as shall be prescribed by law.

       Review of sentences not in excess of statutory limits and where there is no error is not within the jurisdiction of the courts as the exercise of clemency is given to the executive branch. Osborne v. State, 237 Ark. 5, 371 S.W.2d 518 (1963); Patterson v. State, 253 Ark. 393, 486 S.W.2d 19 (1972); Abbott v. State, 256 Ark. 558, 508 S.W.2d 733 (1974).

       The executive branch has the sole authority to grant clemency to deserving individuals. Smith v. State, 262 Ark. 239, 555 S.W.2d 569 (1977); Coones v. State, 280 Ark. 321, 657 S.W.2d 553 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the power to pardon is held by the Governor, courts have no authority to reduce a defendant's sentence on the basis that it is unduly harsh. Shelton v. State, 44 Ark. App. 156, 870 S.W.2d 398 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power to exercise clemency is vested in the chief executive and not the courts. Pickens v. Tucker, 316 Ark. 811, 875 S.W.2d 835 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Arkansas Constitution gives the power to grant clemency to no other individual as long as the Governor is within the state and in full possession of his faculties; if he does not exercise his power to grant or deny clemency, there is no one else able to do so, and no constitutional rights are abrogated because the Governor cannot be impartial or objective.

      <p>
       The power to remit fines and forfeitures as well as the power to pardon is confined to criminal or penal cases after conviction or judgment and does not reach to granting general amnesties nor relief from civil penalties or forfeitures. Hutton v. McCleskey, 132 Ark. 391, 200 S.W. 1032 (1918); Hood v. State, 237 Ark. 332, 372 S.W.2d 588 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a person charged with a crime made bond and then failed to appear, and a forfeiture was taken on his bond and a jury trial had on the bond forfeiture, the trial by jury did not change the character of the proceedings from a criminal to a civil case and the Governor had the authority to remit the forfeiture of the bond.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a conditional pardon was granted and the condition subsequently broken, the pardon became of no effect and the former judgment was restored to its full force and effect. Ex parte Brady, 70 Ark. 376, 68 S.W. 34 (1902).

      </p>
      <p>
       A general pardon exonerates from the payment of the fine and removes the criminal character of the judgment for costs which become no longer enforceable by imprisonment but only as a civil liability. Ex parte Purcell, 61 Ark. 17, 31 S.W. 738 (1895).

       Trial court did not err in dismissing an inmate's complaint because the complaint failed to state a claim based on a separation-of-powers violation; the restrictions on the Governor's clemency power that the inmate contended diminished it were not sufficient to substantially deprive the Governor of the authority to act.

      The Governor may, by proclamation, on extraordinary occasions, convene the General Assembly at the seat of government, or at a different place, if that shall have become, since their last adjournment, dangerous from an enemy or contagious disease; and he shall specify in his proclamation the purpose for which they are convened; and no other business than that set forth therein shall be transacted until the same shall have been disposed of; after which they may, by a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to both houses, entered upon their journals, remain in session not exceeding fifteen days.

       There are only two types of sessions of the General Assembly in Arkansas — the regular biennial sessions provided by Ark. Const., Art. 5, §§ 5 and 17 and the sessions which the Governor by proclamation convenes under this section, which have come to be known as special sessions. State ex rel. Purcell v.

       The legislature may act freely within the call upon all or any subject specified, and every presumption will be in favor of the regularity of the action, but when the court determines that the act is not within the purposes specified, it is the court's duty to declare the act invalid.

       General Assembly may consider not only the legislation specifically mentioned and set forth in the proclamation, but such other legislation as may necessarily or incidentally arise out of that call, such as any necessary detail in accomplishing the purpose designated by the call, and a wide range will be conceded to the legislature in deciding what comes within the purview of the call. Pope v. Oliver, 196 Ark. 394, 117 S.W.2d 1072 (1938); McCarroll v. Clyde Collins Liquors, Inc., 198 Ark. 896, 132 S.W.2d 19 (1939).

       The purpose of this section is to prevent the enactment of laws which do not have any connection or relation to the subjects embraced in the governor's proclamation.

      The provisions of this section limiting the election of a separate county clerk to those counties having a population exceeding 15,000 inhabitants were abolished by Ark. Const. Amend. 41.

      Amendment 80 to the Arkansas Constitution, effective July 1, 2001, established circuit courts as the trial courts of original jurisdiction of all justiciable matters not otherwise assigned pursuant to the Constitution and specifically provided that “jurisdiction conferred on Circuit Courts established by this Amendment includes all matter previously cognizable by Circuit, Chancery, Probate and Juvenile Courts…”.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ark. Const. Amend. 95, which amended this section effective January 1, 2017, was proposed by H.J.R. 1027 during the 2015 Regular Session and adopted at the November 2016 general election by a vote of 747,856 for and 317,093 against. The amendment substituted “four (4) years” for “two years”, inserted “for the term of four (4) years”, and made stylistic changes.

       The court may not point out inferences to be drawn from particular facts in evidence. Rector v. Robins, 82 Ark. 424, 102 S.W. 209 (1907); Duckworth v. State, 83 Ark. 192, 103 S.W. 601 (1907); Thomas v. State, 85 Ark. 138, 107 S.W. 390 (1908); Hogue v. State, 93 Ark. 316, 124 S.W. 783 (1910); McLemore v.

       Credibility of witnesses is for the jury. St. Louis Sw. Ry. v. Britton, 107 Ark. 158, 154 S.W. 215 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       Juries are the sole judges of the weight of the evidence and credibility of witnesses. Texas & Pac. Ry. v. Stephens, 192 Ark. 115, 90 S.W.2d 978 (1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of statute providing for competency hearing prior to criminal trial was not to deprive the jury of its right to determine sanity of the defendant, as this would be contrary to the Constitution, but to furnish the jury the assistance of trained mental experts in order that the jury might reach a proper verdict upon sanity of the defendant. Forby v. Fulk, 214 Ark. 175, 214 S.W.2d 920 (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that an instruction is applicable to the facts and in the language of a statute does not guarantee it is proper. French v. State, 256 Ark. 298, 506 S.W.2d 820 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       General objection to instruction in the words of statute as to presumption based on possession of a certain amount of heroin as being unconstitutional did not raise the issue of an impermissible comment on the evidence by the judge. Brooks v. State, 256 Ark. 1059, 511 S.W.2d 654 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The action of the trial court in resolving the question as to defendant's fitness to stand trial was proper and statute making the issue a question of law does not in any way violate this section. Rogers v. State, 264 Ark. 258, 570 S.W.2d 268 (1978).

      <p>
       The purpose of this section is to give counsel for either party an opportunity to study the instructions and to make objections and exceptions in the judge's chambers, and, when done in that manner, there is no danger of the jury being influenced by rulings that the court makes on request for or objections to instructions. Hicks v. State, 225 Ark. 916, 287 S.W.2d 12 (1956).

       Provision of this section that judges shall not charge juries with regard to matters of fact applies not only to what judges tell jury in course of formal instructions but also as to what they say in colloquies with jurors in jury's hearing. Ark. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Suddreth, 239 Ark. 359, 389 S.W.2d 423 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Issue of the number of prior convictions is a matter of law, not fact; thus, the prohibition against commenting on a factual issue does not apply. McGirt v. State, 289 Ark. 7, 708 S.W.2d 620 (1986).

       An appellant cannot assign as error the failure to instruct on any issue unless he has submitted a proposed instruction on that issue; a mere request for an instruction is insufficient. Mings v. State, 318 Ark. 201, 884 S.W.2d 596 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       An appellant who seeks reversal based on the failure to instruct the jury as requested by the appellant must present a record showing a proffer of the requested instruction. Watson v. State, 329 Ark. 511, 951 S.W.2d 304 (1997).

      <p>
       The requirement of this section applies as well to the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony as to the outright truth or falsity of what they say. Fuller v. State, 217 Ark. 679, 232 S.W.2d 988 (1950); Ark. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Suddreth, 239 Ark. 359, 389 S.W.2d 423 (1965); Seale v. State, 240 Ark. 466, 400 S.W.2d 269 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Determining credibility of witnesses is within a jury's domain. Scroggins v. State, 312 Ark. 106, 848 S.W.2d 400 (1993).

      <p>
       There was no ground for reversal in the refusal to give a cautionary instruction in the absence of gross abuse of discretion where the trial judge did instruct the jury that it was the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to the testimony of any and all witnesses and that these were matters with which the court had nothing to do. Cobb v. State, 265 Ark. 527, 579 S.W.2d 612 (1979).

      <p>
       The court is not allowed to instruct as to a different weight for affirmative and negative testimony. Keith v. State, 49 Ark. 439, 5 S.W. 880 (1887).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may not instruct the jury to resolve the bias of a witness against the party in whose favor he leans. Bing v. State, 52 Ark. 263, 12 S.W. 559 (1889).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the court answered a question asked by the jury during deliberation after the court had conferred with counsel for the State and the defendant and with the consent of the defendant's counsel, the instruction was not proper, but because the consent was given by the defendant, it was not reversible error. Clack v. State, 213 Ark. 652, 212 S.W.2d 20 (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant was on trial for murder of deceased, the court properly refused an instruction of the defendant which requested the court to instruct the jury that if deceased was of a rash, turbulent, and violent disposition, and the defendant has knowledge of such disposition, the jury might consider this as a reasonable cause for defendant's apprehension of great personal injury to her. Cellars v. State, 214 Ark. 326, 216 S.W.2d 47 (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error for court in action against defendant for crime of fondling a child to give instruction to jury to the effect that no corroboration of testimony offered by prosecuting witness was necessary and that her testimony alone, if believed by jury beyond a reasonable doubt, was sufficient to sustain a conviction. Skaggs v. State, 234 Ark. 510, 353 S.W.2d 3 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is error for the trial court to instruct the jury as to the written report of the physician employed by the state hospital because it singles out and calls the jury's attention to particular evidence. Walker v. State, 239 Ark. 172, 388 S.W.2d 13 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instructions upon the weight of evidence, or which assume facts which are for the consideration of the jury, are erroneous. Flynn v. State, 43 Ark. 289 (1884); Polk v. State, 45 Ark. 165 (1885); Stephens v. Oppenheimer & Sons, 45 Ark. 492 (1885); Cameron v. Vandergriff, 53 Ark. 381, 13 S.W. 1092 (1890); Blankenship v.

       It is error for the judge, in the presence of the jury, to advise the state's attorney to dismiss a prosecution for the want of evidence. State v. Wardlaw, 43 Ark. 73 (1884); O'Neal v. Richardson, 78 Ark. 132, 92 S.W. 1117 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       In eminent domain proceeding where, in response to motion to strike certain testimony of expert because expert allegedly took into consideration elements not recoverable, trial judge stated that he understood from testimony that witness did not consider those matters, comments of trial judge amounted to construction of testimony and comment on the evidence within the meaning of the prohibition of this section. Ark. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Suddreth, 239 Ark. 359, 389 S.W.2d 423 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reading of that portion of statute relating to failure to pay liens being prima facie evidence of intent to defraud is prohibited by this section, which prohibits the court from commenting on the evidence to the jury. Reno v. State, 241 Ark. 127, 406 S.W.2d 372 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where statement of the court in the presence of the jury was not merely a comment on the evidence, but constituted a disposition by the court of a material fact question tending to irrevocably fix in the minds of the jury that the defendants were at fault, leaving the question of equal or greater fault upon the part of others at interest in the litigation open, the damage to defendants was not cured by any subsequent action of the court. Chicago, R.I. & Pac. R.R. v. Adair, 241 Ark. 412, 407 S.W.2d 930 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remarks of the court concerning the character of a witness is an invasion of the province of the jury and violative of this section. Williams v. State, 175 Ark. 752, 2 S.W.2d 36 (1927); Cameron v. State, 214 Ark. 512, 216 S.W.2d 881 (1949); West v. State, 255 Ark. 668, 501 S.W.2d 771 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a law provides that a bank would not be liable if a joint tenant withdrew money without a passbook and another law permits the existence of a contract requiring the use of a passbook, a judge's comment that one is a later statement of the law is an improper comment on the evidence. Haseman v. Union Bank, 262 Ark. 803, 562 S.W.2d 45 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is reversible error for a judge to express an opinion concerning a fact in the presence of the jury. Roe Rice & Land Co. v. Strobhart, 123 Ark. 146, 184 S.W. 461 (1916); Hinson v. State, 133 Ark. 149, 201 S.W. 811 (1918); Cameron v. State, 214 Ark. 512, 216 S.W.2d 881 (1949); Breeden v. State, 270 Ark. 90, 603 S.W.2d 459 (1980); Tandy Corp. v.

       It was improper and prejudicial for trial court to permit policemen who had testified against defendant to sit within the rail in a place usually reserved for the parties during the closing arguments, as this amounted to a comment on the evidence.

       The second paragraph of AMI Civil 3d 1501 (a medical malpractice instruction) does not violate this section by making an improper comment on the evidence because it does not provide for the testimony of any particular expert witness to be given greater weight; rather, it simply instructs the jury that, when a physician's skill or learning has been challenged, the applicable standard of care is to be determined exclusively through the assistance of expert testimony.

       Court's procedure in giving oral charge to jury on its request for further instructions was not prejudicial error where the defense objected to the charges having been oral after the jury had again left the courtroom and there was no request that the supplemental instruction be reduced to writing, which, if accomplished before the end of the trial, would have complied literally with the constitutional requirement.

       Statement by the court in its charge to the jury that “it is undisputed that the prosecutrix, Carolyn Phelps, was under the age of 16 years at the time of the alleged crime,” was not a comment on the weight of the evidence, as statement meant that no witness had testified in direct contradiction to evidence that Carolyn was under 16.

       In prosecution for rape and burglary, where prosecutrix had previously identified the defendant as her assailant, the defense had challenged her identification of the defendant, and the prosecution sought to have her again identify the defendant as her assailant, a remark by the trial court merely restating the witness' testimony on this matter did not constitute a comment on the evidence in violation of this section. Conley v. State, 267 Ark. 713, 590 S.W.2d 66 (Ct. App. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant did not respond to request for disclosure of any defense to be used at trial, and trial judge, unaware of defendant's defense, questioned the relevancy of the defense counsel's line of questioning in front of the jury, which counsel was permitted to pursue after in chambers discussions, the questioning by the judge did not amount to an impermissible comment on defendant's evidence under this section. Warren v. State, 272 Ark. 231, 613 S.W.2d 97 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the trial judge, in sustaining an objection to a line of questioning, stated that the questioning of the preceding witness had “got out of hand,” the defendant was not entitled to a mistrial on the ground that the court had commented on the evidence where the trial judge admonished the jury that he had not intended by anything he had done or said to intimate or suggest what they should find to be the facts. Barnes v. State, 4 Ark. App. 84, 628 S.W.2d 334 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, in a prosecution for rape and burglary, the trial court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury, prior to the testimony of the victim of a separate rape, to the effect that the sole purpose of the testimony was to determine whether the two rapes were committed by the same person, the instruction was proper and did not amount to a comment on the facts in violation of this section. Kellensworth v. State, 275 Ark. 252, 631 S.W.2d 1 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court's comment stating that “that's the state of the record at this time” and telling the jury that the issue of a blood test being given or not given was “not an issue in this case” was merely an attempt to sum up the proof at that point in the trial and clearly left open the possibility of testimony being developed later in the trial. Weatherford v. State, 286 Ark. 376, 692 S.W.2d 605 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial judge's comment equating “road dope,” the meaning of which was at issue during the trial, with “amphetamine,” a controlled substance, and his incorrect statement that defendant had “sold” a substance to a police officer, amounted merely to harmless error. Honea v. State, 15 Ark. App. 382, 695 S.W.2d 391 (1985).

       If there is any evidence, however slight, pertinent to the issue, the court should not take it from the jury and direct their verdict. Little Rock & Fort Smith Ry. v. Barker, 33 Ark. 350 (1878); Harris v. State, 34 Ark. 469 (1879); Edmonds v. State, 34 Ark. 720 (1879); Overton v. Matthews, 35 Ark. 146 (1879); St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v.

       The verdicts of juries shall not be set aside by the court if there is substantial evidence to sustain them. Washington County v. Day, 196 Ark. 147, 116 S.W.2d 1051 (1938).
      </p>

       Appellate court, when confronted with substantial evidence found to be true by verdict of the jury, the effect of which does not violate or contradict any well known natural law or principle, is not at liberty to disregard such verdict.

      <p>
       Where the amount to be recovered by the plaintiff was a disputed question of fact, it was the exclusive province of the jury to determine it; the court has no power to amend the verdict by increasing or decreasing the amount found by the jury as the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the jury upon a disputed question of fact.

       In jury trials, when the evidence is not legally sufficient to sustain a verdict for plaintiff, it is the duty of the court to so declare the law. If the whole case appears to have been developed, a verdict for the defendant should be directed; if it is probable that the missing link in the evidence can be supplied, the plaintiff should be permitted to take a nonsuit. Catlett v. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry., 57 Ark. 461, 21 S.W. 1062 (1893).

       Section 16-10-108, which sets forth the powers of the court in punishing criminal contempt, is not a limitation on the power of the court to inflict punishment for disobedience of process, for, under this section of the constitution, the legislature cannot abridge the power of the courts to punish for contempt in disobedience of their process; the constitution specially reserved this inherent power in the courts when delegating authority to the legislature to regulate punishments for contempts.

       The standard regarding the inherent power of the court to sentence someone for contempt under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c10s16-10-108" target="_blank">16-10-108</a></cite> is included in this section. Carle v. Burnett, 311 Ark. 477, 845 S.W.2d 7 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power to punish for contempt is inherent in courts; they may go beyond the powers given by statute. Carle v. Burnett, 311 Ark. 477, 845 S.W.2d 7 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney's actions in disobeying the court's order fell within the inherent powers of the court to punish for contempt under this section; the court was not bound by the limitations set out in the contempt statute (§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c10s16-10-108" target="_blank">16-10-108</a></cite>). Carle v. Burnett, 311 Ark. 477, 845 S.W.2d 7 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jail sentence for an attorney was voided as the judge plainly, manifestly, and grossly abused his discretion in using criminal contempt as a penalty for the failure of the attorney to pay the sanctions imposed by the judge in the civil proceeding. Ivy v. Keith, 351 Ark. 269, 92 S.W.3d 671 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sixty-day sentence for contempt based on a failure to pay child support was allowable, despite the lack of statutory authority under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c04s5-4-201ol1b3" target="_blank">5-4-201(b)(3)</a></cite>, because the will of the General Assembly was not a limitation upon the power of the trial court to inflict a reasonable punishment for disobedience.
   Norman v. Cooper, 101 Ark. App. 446, 278 S.W.3d 569 (2008).

      <p>
       Permanent restraining order, which authorized law-enforcement officers to arrest and incarcerate a mother for actions far beyond the statutory offense of interference with visitation, under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c26s5-26-501" target="_blank">5-26-501</a></cite>, was an impermissible delegation of the circuit court's judicial power, under this section, to enforce its orders by finding the mother in contempt, under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c10s16-10-108" target="_blank">16-10-108</a></cite>.

       This section relates to the elective county and township officers created by the Constitution itself. Patton v. Vaughan, 39 Ark. 211 (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly from the language of this section a circuit court has jurisdiction, upon presentment of a indictment, to remove the county sheriff from office. Hester v. Langston, 297 Ark. 87, 759 S.W.2d 797 (1988).

      <p>
       A public officer is not subject to removal from office because of acts done prior to his present term of office. Rice v. State, 204 Ark. 236, 161 S.W.2d 401 (1942).

        Indictment, Information, or Presentment.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The terms “information,” “presentment”, and “indictment” are used in their own technical common-law sense and, where not regulated by statute, the practice will be as at common law. State v. Whitlock, 41 Ark. 403 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the alleged cause of removal is a matter not cognizable by a grand jury, the prosecuting attorney may proceed upon his own motion by information filed under oath; but, if it is an indictable offense, the proceeding must be by indictment. Haskins v. State, 47 Ark. 243, 1 S.W. 242 (1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       In case the removal is to be accomplished by an indictment, the offense set forth must be one which necessarily includes the grounds for removal, otherwise, removal would be accomplished without trial upon the issue as to the existence of grounds for removal. McClain v. Sorrels, 152 Ark. 321, 238 S.W. 72 (1922).

       The Constitution provides a complete scheme for declaring forfeitures of office and removing officers, and there is an implied prohibition against legislative interference. Speer v. Wood, 128 Ark. 183, 193 S.W. 785 (1917).

       There is no authority for a circuit court to remove a county officer without any notice; notice is the foundation of due process of law and, where there was none, an order for the removal of judge would be invalid. Anderson v. State, 266 Ark. 192, 583 S.W.2d 14 (1979).

      <p>
       Under this section, no final order of removal would be made until after trial and conviction; however, a statute permitting suspension from office prior to the trial was not violative of this section. Allen v. State, 32 Ark. 241 (1877).
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable may be suspended for any criminal conduct amounting to a felony, whether it be official misconduct or not. Jones v. State, 104 Ark. 261, 149 S.W. 56 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       A preliminary order of suspension unauthorized by statute is void. Winfrey v. State, 133 Ark. 357, 202 S.W. 23 (1918).

       When a landowner filed her petition for injunction, the construction of the road was an accomplished fact; thus, her only remedy against the county was to file a claim in the county court for just compensation for a completed taking, inasmuch as exclusive jurisdiction of defendant's claim for compensation was vested in the county court as a matter relating to county roads, and the county could not be sued to recover this compensation by inverse condemnation proceedings.

       The statute providing for the appointment of professional appraisers by the county court to appraise property as an aid to the tax assessor upon petition of assessors, members of county equalization board and members of municipal councils and school boards in the area was not in contravention of this section on grounds that the statute inhibited the expenditure of county taxes since county court had discretion as to acting on petition and could disapprove contract appointing such assessors.

       Action to recover funds mistakenly paid to school district was not merely a “county tax” matter as such, but rather a matter of overpayment which addressed itself to the chancery court's jurisdiction to correct mistakes, and so county court was not the only court with jurisdiction to hear the case.

       Although illegal taxes can be enjoined by a court of equity, if the taxes complained of are not themselves illegal, a suit for illegal exaction will not lie in chancery court; a flaw in the assessment of collection procedure, no matter how serious from the taxpayer's point of view, does not make the exaction itself illegal, and any relief from such county taxes must be sought in county court.

       Because a plaintiff's summons ran in his name, rather than the State of Arkansas, it failed to meet the requirements of Ark. R. Civ. P. 4, which necessarily incorporated this section, and it was, therefore, not a valid summons. Plaintiff had no authority to direct the summons to defendant, and thus, the circuit court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to serve a valid summons on appellee.

       Court erred in finding that service of process was effective, because the summons and complaint were not delivered to the debtor personally, and while the summons and complaint were undisputedly left with the debtor's husband, the creditor offered no evidence that the husband was an agent authorized to receive service of process on behalf of the debtor under Ark.

      Effect of Amendment.
     </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Ark. Const. Amend. 73 did not repeal the two-year term provision of this article. Moore v. McCuen, 317 Ark. 105, 876 S.W.2d 237 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Ark. Const. Amend. 73, § 2 does not mention a cap on the total number of years a senator may serve but only states explicitly that a senator may not “serve more than two such four year terms”; Const. Amend. 73 does not touch on the subject of staggered terms for senators and the assignment of two year terms by lot for 18 senators after reapportionment as required by this article. Moore v. McCuen, 317 Ark. 105, 876 S.W.2d 237 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     The state has a rational basis for preserving the staggered term provisions which have been a part of the constitutions for more than 150 years; there is nothing in the record to suggest there was any intention on the part of the drafters of Const. Amend. 73 or of the voters in adopting it to discriminate against either the candidates or the electorate of any district. The fact that the amendment, when construed in connection with this article, will bring about modest and temporary differences in the total time a senator in a particular district may serve compared to senators of some other districts is simply incidental to the combination of constitutional provisions. Moore v. McCuen, 317 Ark. 105, 876 S.W.2d 237 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     The disadvantages, if any, to voters of a senate district in being deprived of the opportunity to prolong the incumbency of their senator under Ark. Const. Amend. 73 will be temporary and incidental to the state's interest in preserving the staggered term provisions of this article. Moore v. McCuen, 317 Ark. 105, 876 S.W.2d 237 (1994).

       Provision requiring each county to have one representative is unconstitutional under U.S. Constitution. Yancey v. Faubus, 238 F. Supp. 290 (E.D. Ark. 1965), aff'd, Crawford County Bar Ass'n v. Faubus, <cite class="us_code">383 U.S. 271</cite>, <cite class="s_court">86 S. Ct. 933</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">15 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 750 (1966); Wells v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that federal court ruled a portion of this section unconstitutional did not affect the constitutionality of the provision fixing the number of House members at 100. Faubus v. Kinney, 239 Ark. 443, 389 S.W.2d 887 (1965); Harvey v. Clinton, 308 Ark. 546, 826 S.W.2d 236 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of representatives apportioned to northwest Arkansas is within constitutional standards. Harvey v. Clinton, 308 Ark. 546, 826 S.W.2d 236 (1992).

        Apportionment.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In apportioning representatives under this provision, a method of equal proportions should be used in preference to other systems. Shaw, Autry & Shofner v. Adkins, 202 Ark. 856, 153 S.W.2d 415 (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board of Apportionment was mistaken in seeking that method of apportionment that would cause the least change in the existing representation. Stevens v. Faubus, 234 Ark. 826, 354 S.W.2d 707 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board of Apportionment may cross county lines in the formation of districts whenever it is necessary to comply with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Wells v. White, 274 Ark. 197, 623 S.W.2d 187 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">456 U.S. 906</cite>, <cite class="s_court">102 S. Ct. 1753</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">72 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 163 (1982); Taylor v. Clinton, 284 Ark. 170, 680 S.W.2d 98 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       After each federal decennial census, the Board of Apportionment must apportion the one hundred members of the House of Representatives to acheive, as nearly as possible, equal population among the one hundred districts. Harvey v. Clinton, 308 Ark. 546, 826 S.W.2d 236 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A consideration in apportioning the members of the House of Representatives is insuring some voice to all political subdivisions. Harvey v. Clinton, 308 Ark. 546, 826 S.W.2d 236 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing local communities to express whether they favor retaining multi-member districts or changing to single-member districts, and then reapportioning in accordance with those wishes, is an appropriate function of state government; so long as those wishes do not run afoul of a constitutional or statutory mandate, population variances are within constitutional standards and the Board of Apportionment was not arbitrary simply because it recognized the preference of local communities. Harvey v. Clinton, 308 Ark. 546, 826 S.W.2d 236 (1992).
      </p>
      <h4 id="constitutionara08s02CaseNotesMultiMemberDistricts.">

        Multi-Member Districts.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Fact that there were multi-member districts in apportionment plan did not make it unconstitutional. Kelly v. Bumpers, 340 F. Supp. 568 (E.D. Ark. 1972), aff'd, <cite class="us_code">413 U.S. 901</cite>, <cite class="s_court">93 S. Ct. 3047</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">37 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 1019 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this article prohibits multi-member districts. Harvey v. Clinton, 308 Ark. 546, 826 S.W.2d 236 (1992).
      </p>

       The use of multi-member districts by the Board of Apportionment has never been held to be unconstitutional per se, and the judicial branch cannot impose its judgment on the executive branch solely because it might favor the use of single-member districts.

       § 3. Senatorial districts — Thirty-five members of Senate.

     <p>
      The Senate shall consist of thirty-five members. Senatorial districts shall at all times consist of contiguous territory, and no county shall be divided in the formation of such districts. “The Board of Apportionment” hereby created shall, from time to time, divide the state into convenient senatorial districts in such manner as that the Senate shall be based upon the inhabitants of the state, each senator representing, as nearly as practicable, an equal number thereof; each district shall have at least one senator. [As amended by Const. Amend. 23.]

      Publisher's Notes.
   
   The provision of this section prohibiting the division of counties was held unconstitutional, under the U.S. Constitution, in Wells v. White, 274 Ark. 197, 623 S.W.2d 187 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">456 U.S. 906</cite>, <cite class="s_court">102 S. Ct. 1753</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">72 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 163 (1982).
     </p>
     <p>
      An amendment to this section by Ark. Const. Amend. 45 was declared unconstitutional in Yancey v. Faubus, 238 F. Supp. 290 (E.D. Ark. 1965). As so amended, the section would have read:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Senate shall consist of thirty-five members. Senatorial districts as now constituted and existing as heretofore directed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas in the case of Pickens v. Board of Apportionment, 220 Ark. 145, 246 S.W.2d 556, shall remain the same and the number of Senators from the districts shall not be changed.”

       This section, both in its original form and as amended by Ark. Const. Amend. 23, and Ark. Const. Amend. 45, is an unconstitutional violation of the one-man, one-vote principle as it relates to the boundaries of various districts in that it provides that senatorial districts may not be constituted so as to divide a county into separate districts.

       This section was intended to divide the state into convenient senatorial districts and to provide for the number of representatives in each county, and expression “from time to time” indicates that this apportionment should be made only when there was a change in the population so that, without a reapportionment, the senator would not represent the number specified.

       This section does not require a geographical change in the senatorial districts after each census but only if shifting population makes it necessary to afford just and equitable and equal representation. Butler v. Democratic State Comm., 204 Ark. 14, 160 S.W.2d 494 (1942).

      <p>
       This section requires a reapportionment after each census but only when, in making the reapportionment, a redivision of the state into senatorial districts is found necessary must an entirely new Senate be elected; if no necessity existed to make changes in the boundaries of senatorial districts, the senators would serve for the respective terms for which they had been elected.

      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment of State Senate by board created under this amendment, as amended by Ark. Const. Amend. 45, was constitutionally permissible although in drawing districts, counties were divided, and the apportionment created a departure of population of state legislative districts from the ideal resulting in a spread of variation from the ideal among multi-member districts of 5.9% and a spread of 9.5% between the largest and the smallest single member districts. Kelly v. Bumpers, 340 F. Supp. 568 (E.D. Ark. 1972), aff'd, <cite class="us_code">413 U.S. 901</cite>, <cite class="s_court">93 S. Ct. 3047</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">37 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 1019 (1973).

       Reapportionment is not required to be made on or before February 1 where on that date census figures available were merely preliminary and not official ones. Carpenter v. Board of Apportionment, 218 Ark. 404, 236 S.W.2d 582 (1951).

       The 30-day time limitation in this section for filing applications for revision of an apportionment plan is reasonable and necessary to give the reapportionment plan a degree of stability and finality; thus, where the petitioners filed their petition for revision two and a half years after the apportionment report was filed, the petition was rejected as untimely.

      At the next general election for State and County officers ensuing after any such apportionment, Representatives shall be elected in accordance therewith, Senators shall be elected henceforth according to the apportionment now existing, and their respective terms of office shall begin on January 1 next following.

      Although Ark. Const. Amend. 45 amended this section to read as it appears above, the court held in Williams v. Elrod, 244 Ark. 671, 426 S.W.2d 797 (1968) that the lot drawing provisions of Const. Amend. 23 were not in conflict with the provisions of Const. Amend. 45 and are still valid. As added by Const. Amend. 23, this section read: “At the next general election for State and County officers ensuing after such apportionment, senators and representatives shall be elected in accordance therewith and their respective terms of office shall begin on January 1 next following. At the first regular session succeeding any apportionment so made, the Senate shall be divided into two classes by lot, eighteen of whom shall serve a period of two years and the remaining seventeen for four years, after which all shall be elected for four years until the next reapportionment hereunder.”

       A plea that the applicant is in possession of land that is his homestead is sufficient to show that the land can not be taken in execution and is good defense to a possessory action. Hughes v. Watt, 26 Ark. 228 (1870) (decision under prior Constitution).
      </p>
      <p>
       The homestead exemption does not run in favor of a dead person and is neither an estate nor a vested interest. Sulcer v. Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co., 263 Ark. 583, 566 S.W.2d 397 (1978).

      <p>
       The occupant of the land is protected in the use and occupancy of land set apart as a homestead during the time of such occupancy, but if abandoned by removal or death, leaving neither wife nor child to succeed to his rights, the rights of the judgment creditor would be fully restored. Norris v. Kidd, 28 Ark. 485 (1873); Chambers v. Sallie, 29 Ark. 407 (1874); Jackson v. Allen, 30 Ark. 110 (1875); Moore v. Granger, 30 Ark. 574 (1875) (preceding decisions under prior Constitution).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conveyance of land in default of creditors, subsequently set aside at the suit of creditors, does not constitute an abandonment of the homestead such as opens it to creditors. Turner v. Vaughan, 33 Ark. 454 (1878); Bennett v. Hutson, 33 Ark. 762 (1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       The owner of land who while not occupying it procured a loan thereon by making a written statement that the land was not his homestead will be deemed to have abandoned the land as a homestead. Farmers' Sav. Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Jones, 68 Ark. 76, 56 S.W. 1062 (1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       By selling her deceased husband's lands, the widow abandoned the homestead. McAndrew v. Hollingsworth, 72 Ark. 446, 81 S.W. 610 (1904); Burel v. Baker, 89 Ark. 168, 116 S.W. 181 (1909); Felton v. Brown, 102 Ark. 658, 145 S.W. 552 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       An attempt to sell may constitute an abandonment. Griffin v. Dunn, 79 Ark. 408, 96 S.W. 190 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       The crucial aspect of whether the homestead has been abandoned is whether the owner intended to return to the homestead. In re Inmon, 137 B.R. 757 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A temporary removal, even for a period of several years, does not constitute an abandonment of a homestead. In re Inmon, 137 B.R. 757 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the right of homestead is acquired and the property remains occupied by the owner, the homestead is not lost by the death of a spouse or departure of dependent children from the home. In re Inmon, 137 B.R. 757 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1992); In re Smith, 137 B.R. 759 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the right of homestead is acquired and the property remains occupied by the owner, the homestead is not lost by the divorce. In re Smith, 137 B.R. 759 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the right of homestead is acquired and the property remains occupied by the owner, the homestead is not lost by the death of a spouse, departure of dependent children from the home, or divorce of the parties; however, the presumption in favor of homestead can be overcome upon a clear showing of abandonment. In re Gerrald, 151 B.R. 217 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The removal from the residence by virtue of a divorce does not automatically deprive debtor of his homestead rights. In re Gerrald, 151 B.R. 217 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A temporary removal, even for a period of several years, does not constitute an abandonment. In re Gerrald, 151 B.R. 217 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the debtor's express intent was to sell the home and obtain the proceeds, not to reoccupy the dwelling, he abandoned the homestead, and the claim of exemption cannot stand. In re Gerrald, 151 B.R. 217 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The district court and the bankruptcy court properly relied on debtor's voluntary agreement to sell the home, rather than his involuntary eviction, to find that debtor abandoned his homestead interest. Gerrald v. Wright, 57 F.3d 652 (8th Cir. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence offered by objecting creditors did not establish that on date petition was filed debtor formed intention to abandon his homestead even though debtor chose to leave homestead and stay at his office after his ex-wife discovered that he was dating another woman; debtor's residing at office could only be viewed as temporary. In re Jones, 193 B.R. 503 (Bankr. E.D.Ark. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not debtor decided to abandon his homestead after petition date was not at issue; critical date was petition date. In re Jones, 193 B.R. 503 (Bankr. E.D.Ark. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtors were not entitled to a homestead exemption under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(b)</cite>(3) based on this section and Ark. Const., Art. 9, § 4. They had abandoned the property when they left it in the belief that a pending sale would close, and they had not returned to it or impressed upon it any characteristics of a homestead at the time they filed bankruptcy.
   In re Ellis, 456 B.R. 401 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2011).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Under ordinary circumstances, the execution of a lease for life would be conclusive evidence of an abandonment, but if a homestead was reserved in the lease, the exemption might be claimed in a suit on the instrument; in a suit between persons not parties to the instrument, parol evidence might be given to show intention to reserve a homestead. Gates v. Steele, 48 Ark. 539, 4 S.W. 53 (1886).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Claim that homestead was exempt was not precluded by bankrupts' failure to appeal from order which allowed personal property as exempt and which made no reference to bankrupts' equity in homestead which was under foreclosure. In re Powers, 339 F. Supp. 1068 (W.D. Ark. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where development company did not record mortgage on real property which debtors in bankruptcy had declared as exempt as their homestead and to which the company was an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding, resulting in discharge of the personal liability of the debtors on the underlying debt, such discharge did not bar enforcement by the state courts, through foreclosure action, of the lien created by the unrecorded mortgage, since the lien was valid between the parties. Cloverleaf Dev., Inc. v. Provence, 273 Ark. 12, 616 S.W.2d 16 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though a homestead is not subject to any lien under this section, a judicial lien would constitute an avoidable impairment of the homestead exemption within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code because the lien impairs the debtors' fresh start. In re Kellar, 204 B.R. 22 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor met the requirements to qualify for a homestead exemption under this section, where she was head of a household and, although she stated that she did not consider the property as her home, she held a legal interest in the property, she resided on the property, and was a resident of Arkansas at the time that her bankruptcy petition was filed. In re Warnock, 323 B.R. 249 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       After a debtor claimed a homestead exemption under Ark. Const., Art. 9, §§ 3 and4 and the trustee did not object pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(b), the court refused to allow the trustee to disguise a belated objection to the exemption as a proposed plan modification or as a response to the debtor's motion for a refund of the proceeds of sale of the homestead.
   In re Tyson, 359 B.R. 239 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Through <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 544(a)</cite>(1), the bankruptcy provided Chapter 12 debtors in possession with judgment lien rights under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c65s16-65-117ol1a1" target="_blank">16-65-117(a)(1)</a></cite>, but the property was subject to a homestead under this section of Article 9 to which such a lien could not attach; thus, avoidance of creditor bank's mortgage was not available under § 544(a)(1).
   Caine v. First State Bank of Crossett (In re Caine), 462 B.R. 688 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 2011), aff'd, No. 1:12-CV-1012, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43360 (W.D. Ark. Mar. 31, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 7 debtor was not entitled to a homestead exemption under this section of Article 9 of the Arkansas Constitution on a house she owned because she committed fraud, in violation of §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.04.html#t04c59s4-59-204" target="_blank">4-59-204</a></cite> and <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.04.html#t04c59s4-59-205" target="_blank">4-59-205</a></cite>, when she transferred money out of a trust she managed and used the money to buy the house while the trust was indebted to a bank, and because the debtor was not entitled to a homestead exemption in the house, the bank's judgment lien on the house did not impair the debtor's interest in the house and the debtor's claim seeking an order avoiding the bank's lien under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(f)</cite> had to be denied.
   In re Gaddy, No. 5:12-bk-72648, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 2326 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. June 7, 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor had not proven existence of lien; judgment liens could not attach to a homestead.
   Humes v. LVNV Funding, LLC (In re Humes), 496 B.R. 557 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2013).
      </p>

       Reservation of a life estate was part of a quitclaim deed's granting clause. Because debtor held only a remainder interest in the property, he was not entitled to a homestead exemption under Arkansas law and thus, the Chapter 13 trustee's objection was sustained.

       A debtor can make a voluntary conveyance of a homestead, convey it with bad motives in regard to creditors, or make any disposition of it, and they have no standing to attack it as fraudulent. As to the homestead there are no creditors. Stanley v. Snyder, 43 Ark. 429 (1884); Bogan v. Cleveland, 52 Ark. 101, 12 S.W. 159 (1889).

        Head of a Family.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The Arkansas Supreme Court has recognized certain factors that are critical in the determination as to whether a debtor qualifies as “head of a family.” These factors are: (1) the existence of an obligation upon the head of the house to support the others; (2) the existence of a corresponding state of depencence upon those being supported; and (3) the head of the family is one in authority where the status or relationship of the family exists. In re Pate, 95 B.R. 102 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1988); In re Collins, 152 B.R. 570 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no dispute that the debtor possessed a homestead within the meaning of this section when, at the time he resided in the property, he was the head of a household, an Arkansas resident, and made the dwelling “home.” In re Gerrald, 151 B.R. 217 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor was entitled to claim a homestead exemption under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522</cite> because she met the elements of head of household under this section, and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c66s16-66-210" target="_blank">16-66-210</a></cite> where (1) although she might not have been legally obligated to support her mother, debtor undertook the obligation, (2) her mother was partially dependent upon the debtor for basic financial needs, and (3) because of the mother's medical condition, the debtor had assumed the decision-making role with regards to household affairs. In re Warnock, 323 B.R. 249 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an unmarried bankruptcy debtor lived with his non-dependent sibling, the debtor nonetheless qualified as head of household for purposes of a homestead exemption since his dependent parent lived with him prior to the parent's death and there was no showing that the homestead was terminated; it was irrelevant that the parent was only partially dependent upon debtor, that debtor might not have been legally obligated to support the parent, and that the parent died prior to debtor's bankruptcy. In re Morris, 340 B.R. 78 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unmarried debtor was entitled to claim property as her homestead under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522</cite> because she qualified as head of a family under this section as of the date she filed her petition where (1) although she was not legally obligated to support her brothers, she was morally obligated to support them; (2) her brothers were partially dependent on her; and (3) she had authority over her brothers while they lived in her home, as one brother conceded her authority, while the other gave her his disability check so that she could pay his bills, and she made sure he took his medicine.

       The concept of “family” in the exemption imposes the requirement of a substantial relationship between the person who is obligated to provide the support and the person who as a dependent relies upon the support. In re Pate, 95 B.R. 102 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to constitute a family, something more is required than a mere aggregation of individuals residing in the same house. In re Pate, 95 B.R. 102 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       To constitute a family, within the meaning of the homestead laws, there must be an obligation upon the head of the house to support other individuals and, on their part, a corresponding state of dependence. Coker v. Bank of Cabot (In re Coker), 127 B.R. 23 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The unmarried debtor satisfied all the elements necessary to establish his being the head of family during the time his child, his child's mother, and her child by a previous marriage were living with him in his home; the debtor's right to claim his exemption continues, notwithstanding the fact that his family has departed.

       After a debtor claimed a homestead exemption under Ark. Const., Art. 9, §§ 3 and4 and the trustee did not object pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(b), the court refused to allow the trustee to disguise a belated objection to the exemption as a proposed plan modification or as a response to the debtor's motion for a refund of the proceeds of sale of the homestead.

       Reservation of a life estate was part of a quitclaim deed's granting clause. Because debtor held only a remainder interest in the property, he was not entitled to a homestead exemption under Arkansas law and thus, the Chapter 13 trustee's objection was sustained.

       There being no precise legal definition of the terms ‘city, town or village,’ as used in the Constitution of Arkansas defining a homestead, the court will presume that the words were used in their popular sense. Bank of Sun Prairie v. Hovig, 218 F. Supp. 769 (W.D. Ark. 1963).

       Debtor was entitled to claim exemptions under Ark. Const., Art. 9, § 1 and this section, for cash and his rural homestead.

       Where a 20-acre tract was located within the limits of an incorporated town, but the property was used exclusively for agricultural purposes and as defendant's home, and where the incorporated town had no schools, industry, service stations or other municipal services characteristic of a “town,” the land qualified for a rural homestead exemption.

      <p>
       Debtor was entitled to exempt the 80-acre portion of the debtor's homestead that the debtor elected to retain because, after the debtor acquired the homestead in a 12.6-acre site, the debtor expanded the homestead by acquiring the contiguous 80 acres, the debtor lived on the homestead continuously, and the debtor's homestead did not terminate simply because the debtor's children reached the age of majority and the debtor then lived alone.

       While property claimed by debtors as homestead was rural, and therefore debtors could carve out up to 80 acres of such property for exemption, only approximately half of the property qualified for homestead exemption because objectors met their burden to show that the river running through the property was navigable, which meant the contiguous nature of the claimed homestead was destroyed.

       Evidence showing 80 acres of land divided into two 40 acre tracts by a dirt road, and that the tract upon which the house is located is not fenced, has not been cultivated, and the only use has been for wood for fuel and for sale of wood for ties, is not incompatible with a claim that the entire 80 acres is part of the homestead.

       Once the homestead exemption attaches, it is not lost if subsequently the debtor's family departs from the homestead because of death, divorce, or the arrival of children at the age of majority. Scott County Bank v. McCraw (In re McCraw), 58 B.R. 175 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1985).

      <p>
       Even though prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition the debtor was divorced from her husband, and at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed she lived on the property alone and unmarried, the homestead exemption was available where the debtor was married at the time the property in question was purchased and she resided in a residence located on the property with her husband.

       Where the debtor elected bankruptcy exemptions under state law rather than <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522</cite>, the court found that the debtor's claimed interest was abandoned by the debtor; the property was no longer impressed with homestead character sufficient to allow the debtor to claim a right to homestead exemption in the property pursuant to §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c66s16-66-217" target="_blank">16-66-217</a></cite> and <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c66s16-66-218" target="_blank">16-66-218</a></cite>.

       The fact that a homestead had not been divided into lots, and is used for farm purposes only, may be considered in determining whether it is urban or rural; but, when determined that it is within a town, city, or village, then the fact that it has not been divided into lots can be of no effect.

       Where, in probate proceeding, decedent's widow elected to take against the will and, as a widow with no children, was awarded the homestead interest as against the interest of her step-children, which entitled her to possession of the homestead and all of the rents and profits from the lands devised to the step-children, the constitutional provision under this section which so allows is discriminatory since the constitution makes no comparable provision for men and, if the widow had died before decedent, he could not have been allowed possession of her home, even though he had none; thus, this section of the Constitution, as applied, violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution since there is no valid governmental function to justify the dissimilar treatment of widows and widowers.

       Section 12-61-115(a) left the decision as to whether to issue a proclamation of a state of insurrection or emergency to the discretion of the Governor of Arkansas; however, the lack of such a proclamation did not mean that the National Guard's involvement in counterdrug surveillance was unlawful, particularly since the Governor had certified that the counterdrug plan complied with Arkansas law.

      The fiscal affairs of counties, cities and incorporated towns shall be conducted on a sound financial basis, and no county court or levying board or agent of any county shall make or authorize any contract or make any allowance for any purpose whatsoever in excess of the revenue from all sources for the fiscal year in which said contract or allowance is made; nor shall any county judge, county clerk, or other county officer, sign or issue any scrip warrant or make any allowance in excess of the revenue from all sources for the current fiscal year; nor shall any city council, board of aldermen, board of public affairs, or commissioners, of any city of the first or second class, or any incorporated town, enter into any contract or make any allowance for any purpose whatsoever, or authorize the issuance of any contract or warrants, scrip or other evidences of indebtedness in excess of the revenue for such city or town for the current fiscal year; nor shall any mayor, city clerk, or recorder, or any other officer or officers, however designated, of any city of the first or second class or incorporated town sign or issue scrip, warrant or other certificate of indebtedness of excess of the revenue from all sources for the current fiscal year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, to secure funds to pay indebtedness outstanding at the time of the adoption of this amendment, counties, cities, and incorporated towns may issue interest bearing certificates of indebtedness or bonds with interest coupons for the payment of which a county or city tax, in addition to that now authorized, not exceeding three mills may be levied for the time as provided by law until such indebtedness is paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the annual report of any city or county in the State of Arkansas shows that scrip, warrants or other certificate of indebtedness had been issued in excess of the total revenue for that year, the officer or officers of the county or city or incorporated town who authorized, signed or issued such scrip, warrants or other certificates of indebtedness shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in any sum not less than five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars, and shall be removed from office. [As amended by Const. Amend. 10.]

      </p>

       A county which has issued bonds to pay debts existing prior to October 7, 1924, under Amendment No. 10 may pay indebtedness existing prior to December 7, 1924, from surplus bond account or by supplemental bond issue. Hagler v. Arkansas County, 176 Ark. 115, 2 S.W.2d 5 (1928).
      </p>

       Revenue bonds are not general obligations of the county but rather are bonds payable solely from the revenues derived from service charges; therefore, this section is not applicable to the value of the bonds issued and the bonds did not create an indebtedness exceeding the limitations of this section.

        Claims in Excess of Revenues.

      <p>
       The fiscal year under this section is the fiscal year for all purposes, county warrants in excess of revenues for the fiscal year are void, and the holder of a valid warrant may compel payment thereof to the exclusion of the invalid warrants. McGregor v. Miller, 173 Ark. 459, 293 S.W. 30 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       County warrants issued in excess of revenues for fiscal year are void, but warrants issued when there is insufficient money in the county treasury to redeem when the fiscal year revenue limit has not been exceeded are not invalid for lack of funds. Miller v. State ex rel. Woodruff County, 176 Ark. 889, 1 S.W.2d 998 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claim incurred and due when the claim could have been constitutionally paid cannot be allowed when the claim exceeded the revenue for the current fiscal year. Pulaski County v. Board of Trustees, 186 Ark. 61, 52 S.W.2d 972 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       All expenses, indispensable or permissive, are prohibited by the amendment if in excess of the county revenue. Miller County v. Blocker, 192 Ark. 101, 90 S.W.2d 218 (1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a city levied less tax than the permissible five mill tax was unimportant as to its right to contract as the city's right to contract and incur obligations is limited by the amount which it did collect and not what might have been collected. Manhattan Rubber Mfg. Div. of Raybestos, Inc. v. Bird, 208 Ark. 167, 185 S.W.2d 268 (1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceeding by police chief for a summary judgment for salary due during time he was suspended from duty as chief as the result of an order of the civil service commission, which was subsequently set aside, was an action based upon a statutory liability which did not mature until the appeal of the chief from the civil service commission's order was finally disposed of; therefore, the defense based on the contention that recovery of the amount found due the police chief would be a violation of the Constitution was not available as to years prior to the determination of the appeal. City of Van Buren v. Matlock, 208 Ark. 529, 186 S.W.2d 936 (1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not prohibit the creation of a debt exceeding current annual revenues if the debt was secured by and payable solely out of the income or assets of a special and separable activity such as a municipal waterworks. Hink v. Board of Dirs., 235 Ark. 107, 357 S.W.2d 271 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The prosecuting attorney was a proper party plaintiff, in fact, it was his express duty to enforce the terms of this provision of the Constitution dealing with the prohibition against a county judge authorizing any contract in excess of the revenues which was one of the principal issues in this case. Goodwin v. State, 235 Ark. 457, 360 S.W.2d 490 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city's multi-year agreement with a union actually boiled down to a series of yearly contracts with a health insurance provider that could not exceed annual city revenues, the city did not violate this section by entering into a multi-year agreement with the union.
   American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 2957 v. City of Benton, 513 F.3d 874 (8th Cir. 2008).

       In a case involving a rock quarry that was located entirely outside, but within one mile of, the corporate limits of a city in which a district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Fayetteville, Ark. Ordinance No. 5280 prior to its enforcement date, city argued that the company that operated the quarry was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim that the city lacked authority to license and regulate its quarry, because the ordinance was enacted pursuant to § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.14.html#t14c54s14-54-103ol11" target="_blank">14-54-103(1)</a></cite>. Contrary to the city's argument, since the quarry was located outside the corporate city limits but within one mile of those limits, the city could not regulate the quarry without a judicial determination that its activities constituted a nuisance, and no such judicial determination had been made; the quarry was not a nuisance per se.

       This section does not suggest the right of eminent domain is limited to corporations; to read this section with such implied restrictions would be contrary to the court's interpretation of the general grant of eminent domain to the state in Art. 2, § 23. Young v. Energy Transp. Sys., 278 Ark. 146, 644 S.W.2d 266 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">465 U.S. 1105</cite>, <cite class="s_court">104 S. Ct. 1606</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">80 L.

       Circuit court did not err in affirming an order of the Oil and Gas Commission integrating an owner's unleased mineral interests into a drilling unit because the owner failed to satisfy his burden of showing that §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c72s15-72-303" target="_blank">15-72-303</a></cite> and <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c72s15-72-304" target="_blank">15-72-304</a></cite> clearly violated the Arkansas Constitution; the owner cited no authority for the proposition that the forced-integration provisions constituted a corporate “appropriation” of his property under this section, and thus, he had no constitutional right to a jury trial on the issue of compensation.

       Act requiring payment over to other public schools or nonprofit private schools accredited by the State Board of Education from the funds withheld from closed schools of an amount calculated on a pro rata basis according to the number of students from the closed schools attending a recipient school was not unconstitutional as as assumption of payment of the debt or liability of any county, town, city or other corporation whatever, for if a student from a closed school attended a private school any resulting debt or liability would be payable to the school, not by it.

       Arkansas Supreme Court had the duty under Ark.

       Any use of school funds raised from taxation that results in benefits to those funds or property or aids in the stated purposes for which these funds may be expended would not be an unconstitutional diversion and the use of such funds for the payment of assessments for local improvements beneficial to school property does not violate this section.

       Any use of school funds that results in benefits to school funds or property, or aids in the stated purposes for which these funds may be expended, is not an unconstitutional diversion; and where public school fund monies were appropriated to pay federally mandated costs of desegregation cases and attorney's fees, they were used for the benefit of public education.

       Taxpayers made no argument that the school board violated any statutory provision regarding school expenditures where, without question, the payment of a salary and benefits to a superintendent was both immediately and directly connected with the establishment and maintenance of a common school system and absolutely necessary for the maintenance and operation of schools; the school board, while operating and maintaining the school district's schools, determined that the school district could be operated and maintained in a better manner by a different superintendent.

       The General Assembly shall provide for the support of common schools by general law. In order to provide quality education, it is the goal of this state to provide a fair system for the distribution of funds. It is recognized that, in providing such a system, some funding variations may be necessary. The primary reason for allowing such variations is to allow school districts, to the extent permissible, to raise additional funds to enhance the educational system within the school district. It is further recognized that funding variations or restrictions thereon may be necessary in order to comply with, or due to, other provisions of this Constitution, the United States Constitution, state or federal laws, or court orders.

      </b>
      Before amendment, this section read: “The General Assembly shall provide, by general laws, for the support of Common Schools by taxes, which shall never exceed in any one year two mills on the dollar on the taxable property of the State; and by an annual per capita tax of one dollar, to be assessed on every male inhabitant of this State over the age of twenty-one years; Provided, The General Assembly may, by general law, authorize school districts to levy, by a vote of the qualified electors of such district, a tax not to exceed five mills on the dollar in any one year for school purposes; Provided further, That no such tax shall be appropriated to any other purpose, nor to any other district than that for which it was levied.”
     </p>
     <p>
      An amendment adopted in 1906 (see Acts 1905, p. 833) raised the two-mill state tax to three mills and raised the authorized five-mill district tax to seven mills.
     </p>
     <p>
      An amendment adopted in 1916 (see Acts 1917, p. 2304) raised the authorized seven-mill district tax to twelve mills.
     </p>
     <p>
      As amended by Ark. Const. Amend. 11, this section read:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The General Assembly shall provide by the general laws for support of common schools by taxes, which shall never exceed in any one year three mills on the dollar on the taxable property in the state, and by an annual per capita tax of one dollar, to be assessed on every male inhabitant of this State over the age of twenty-one-years. Provided that the General Assembly may, by general law, authorize school districts to levy by a vote of the qualified electors of such districts a tax not to exceed eighteen mills on the dollar in any one year for the maintenance of schools, the erection and equipment of school buildings and the retirement of existing indebtedness for buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Provided further that no such tax shall be appropriated for any other purpose nor to any other district than that for which it was levied.”
     </p>
     <p>
      As amended by Ark. Const. Amend. 40, this section read:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The General Assembly shall provide for the support of common schools by general law, including an annual per capita tax of one dollar, to be assessed on every male inhabitant of this State over the age of twenty-one years; and school districts are hereby authorized to levy by a vote of the qualified electors respectively thereof an annual tax for the maintenance of schools, the erection and equipment of school buildings and the retirement of existing indebtedness, the amount of such tax to be determined in the following manner:

       In a city's challenge to the county assessor's allocation of millage rates, Ark. Const. Amend. 78 did not repeal the uniform rate of 25 mills to be used for maintenance and operation of the schools as provided under Ark. Const. Amend. 74, which amended this section, as the voters were never put on notice that redevelopment projects would be funded with a portion of the uniform rate of 25 mills that had previously been designated solely for the maintenance and operation of the public school. Furthermore, an invincible repugnancy between the amendments did not exist so as to cause a repeal by implication.

       Taxpayers made no argument that the school board violated any statutory provision regarding school expenditures where, without question, the payment of a salary and benefits to a superintendent was both immediately and directly connected with the establishment and maintenance of a common school system and absolutely necessary for the maintenance and operation of schools; the school board, while operating and maintaining the school district's schools, determined that the school district could be operated and maintained in a better manner by a different superintendent.

       An adequate educational opportunity does not mean identical, and Ark. Const. Amend. 74 (which amended this section) allows for variances in school district revenues above the base millage rate of 25 mills, which may lead to enhanced curricula, facilities, and equipment which are superior to what is deemed to be adequate by the state; nevertheless, the overarching constitutional principle is that an adequate education must be provided to all school children on a substantially equal basis with regard to curricula, facilities, and equipment.

       Summary judgment was properly awarded to the Arkansas Governor and state officials in an action claiming that they retained and unlawfully diverted funds derived from property taxes and allocated to the Educational Excellence Trust Fund because Amendment 74 to the Arkansas Constitution, which amended this section, did not place any limits on the General Assembly as to how it appropriated money in excess of that generated by Amendment 74.

      <p>
       In a dispute over the state's attempt to recoup from certain school districts and redistribute twenty-five-mill uniform rate of tax (URT) revenues that were in excess of the foundation-funding amount, the circuit court erred by finding that the URT revenues were state-tax revenues. School taxes were a breed of their own that were neither state nor local; the URT was not converted into a state tax solely because the revenues were remitted to the state treasurer and then back to the school districts.

     <p>
      The Governor and all State officers, Judges of the Supreme and Circuit Courts, Chancellors and Prosecuting Attorneys, shall be liable to impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors, and gross misconduct in office; but the judgment shall go no further than removal from office and disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust or profit under this State. An impeachment, whether successful or not, shall be no bar to an indictment.

     <p>
      Neither the State nor any city, county, town or other municipality in this State shall ever lend its credit for any purpose whatever; nor shall any county, city or town or municipality ever issue any interest bearing evidences of indebtedness, except such bonds as may be authorized by law to provide for and secure the payment of the indebtedness existing at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1874, and the State shall never issue any interest-bearing treasury warrants or scrip. [As amended in 1918 — see Publisher's Notes.]
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Publisher's Notes.
      </b>
      An amendment approved in 1918 and declared in effect after the decision in Brickhouse v. Hill, 167 Ark. 513, 268 S.W. 865 (1925), made minor changes in the original section and added paragraphs authorizing bond issues for certain purposes in incorporated towns of 1,000 or more population and cities of the first and second class. For full text of the amendment, see Acts 1925, p. 1123.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 1918 amendment was deemed superseded by a 1926 amendment, which is currently numbered as Ark. Const. Amend. 13 (See Acts 1927, p. 1210); the 1918 amendment does not appear in prior digests and compilations and is not included in the amendments to which the Secretary of State has assigned numbers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ark. Const. Amend. 13 essentially incorporated the first paragraph of the then-existing section and rewrote or deleted the additional paragraphs. However, Ark. Const. Amend. 62, § 11, repealed Ark. Const. Amend. 13. The Arkansas Supreme Court held, in City of Hot Springs v. Creviston, 288 Ark. 286, 713 S.W.2d 230 (1986), that Ark. Const. Amend. 62 was intended to repeal only language added to this section by Ark. Const. Amend. 13, which the court interpreted as meaning only the 11 paragraphs added by the amendment, but not the pre-existing first paragraph; however, the opinion makes no mention of the changes or additions made by the 1918 amendment. The section appears above as originally enacted in the 1874 Constitution but incorporates the changes made in the paragraph by the 1918 amendment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 1918 amendment made minor punctuation changes and substituted “the indebtedness existing at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1874” for “the present existing indebtedness.”
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to issuance of bonds, this section may be superseded by Ark. Const. Amends. 62 and 65. See also Ark. Const. Amend. 20.

        Improvement Districts.

      </h4>
      <p>
       An improvement district is not a municipality or its agent; it obtains an answer from the legislature and acts as the agent of the property owners whose interests are affected by the duties the district performs. Fitzgerald v. Walker, 55 Ark. 148, 17 S.W. 702 (1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although counties may not lend their credit or issue interest-bearing evidences of debt, the legislature may create an improvement district which consists of an entire county. Board of Dirs. v. Collier, 104 Ark. 425, 149 S.W. 66 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       Local improvement districts, although governmental agencies for some purposes, are not municipal corporations within the constitutional prohibition against issuance of interest-bearing evidences of indebtedness. Nakdimen v. Fort Smith & Van Buren Bridge Dist., 115 Ark. 194, 172 S.W. 272 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal improvement district statutes providing assessments on realty for local improvements based upon consent of two-thirds in value of property holders in affected district is not abrogated by this section. Ray v. City of Mt. Home, 228 Ark. 885, 311 S.W.2d 163 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       An improvement district is not a municipality and is not bound by the restrictions contained in this section requiring an election prior to the issuance of bonds; thus, sewer improvement districts are not bound by the provisions of this section. Bell v. Fulkerson, 291 Ark. 604, 727 S.W.2d 141 (1987).
      </p>

       Even if, under City of Hot Springs v. Creviston, 288 Ark. 286, 705 S.W.2d 415 and Hot Springs v. Creviston, 288 Ark. 286, 288 Ark. 293-A, 713 S.W.2d 230 (1986), bonds issued by a sewer improvement district were held to be under the restrictions of this section requiring an election prior to the issuance of bonds, bonds issued prior to that decision were not affected by it. Bell v. Fulkerson, 291 Ark. 604, 727 S.W.2d 141 (1987).

      <p>
       A board of improvement may contract to pay interest on a debt legally contracted and, when it does so, the interest becomes part of the cost of improvement. Fitzgerald v. Walker, 55 Ark. 148, 17 S.W. 702 (1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city may contract with the grantee of a waterworks franchise that deferred payments of water rentals should bear interest if not paid when due. Lackey v. Fayetteville Water Co., 80 Ark. 108, 96 S.W. 622 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       The authorization of the county court to call in warrants for reissuance payable at a future date and to pay a fair sum for the value of the indulgence of the holders in waiting for payment violates the constitutional prohibition against counties issuing interest-bearing securities. Quinn v. Reed, 130 Ark. 116, 197 S.W. 15 (1917); Gould v. Davis, 133 Ark. 90, 202 S.W. 37 (1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       An act denying further recovery of interest under a subsisting judgment on non-interest-bearing county warrants is valid. Missouri &amp; Ark. Lumber &amp; Mining Co. v.

       Student Loan Authority bonds which will be repaid from income derived from the loan notes and investments, with interest payments coming from the federal government, and which clearly state on their face that they do not constitute an indebtedness or obligation of the State of Arkansas, can be issued without the approval of the electorate. Turner v. Woodruff, 286 Ark. 66, 689 S.W.2d 527 (1985).

       Circuit court properly dismissed a contractor's due process challenge to the method by which breach of contract claims against the State are resolved because the Arkansas Constitution makes clear that it is the duty of the General Assembly and its review subcommittees (which decide appeals from the Arkansas State Claims Commission) to make the very determinations challenged by the contractor and the contractor failed to establish a conflict of interest sufficient to overcome the presumption of impartiality to which the State Claims Commission and the General Assembly are clearly entitled. Thus, the contractor did not demonstrate an unconstitutional act that excepted its due-process claim from the State's sovereign immunity.

       It was not clear error to hold that seven parcels of land owned by a hospital were tax-exempt, where the county tax assessor argued that the hospital's use of the parcels for outpatient clinics was for the pursuit of compensation rather than exclusively for public charity. It was undisputed that the hospital was technically a charitable organization, that the hospital and the hospital's clinics were open to the general public, and that no one was refused services due to inability to pay; the parcels were used exclusively by hospital employees to operate outpatient health-care clinics open to the general public; and precedent did not require a specific percentage of free medical care to qualify for the tax exemption.

       Circuit court committed no reversible error in finding that a recreational improvement district was not operated exclusively for public purposes, and thus was not exempt from ad valorem taxes, where it was formed to serve the district inhabitants and “to contract for the right of the district's property owners”, there was a disparity in the membership fees paid by residents and nonresidents, thereby providing preferential access to residents, and portions of the clubhouse were leased out to a third-party vendor for profit.

      <p>
       There must be equality of burden. This uniformity must be co-extensive with the territory to which the tax applies, whether it be the state, a county, township, city, town, or district. Washington v. State, 13 Ark. 752 (1853); McGehee v. Mathis, 21 Ark. 40 (1860), rev'd, McGee v. Mathis, <cite class="us_code">71 U.S. 143</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">18 L.

       Uniformity must be observed in levying taxes for support of two judicial districts in a county. Hutchinson v. Ozark Land Co., 57 Ark. 554, 22 S.W. 173 (1893); Cotham v. Coffman, 111 Ark. 108, 163 S.W. 1183 (1914); Woolard v. Thomas, 238 Ark. 162, 381 S.W.2d 453 (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       An act fixing the valuation of property in a certain school district for school purposes at a given percent, and at another percent for general taxation, is void, as there must be uniformity both as to rate and the mode of assessment. Hays v. Missouri Pac. R.R., 159 Ark. 101, 250 S.W. 879 (1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxpayer was not entitled to complain that assessment lacked uniformity because fractional interests in mineral rights were not assessed where descriptive lists promised by him to the assessor were withheld until a time apparently sufficient to prevent taxation for current year. Stout Lumber Co. v. Parker, 197 Ark. 65, 122 S.W.2d 180 (1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       A provision of the gasoline tax law that the tax on fuels purchased outside the state and used in the state shall be determined on the basis of five miles per gallon of distillate fuel, as applied to interstate bus companies that actually obtain 6.3 miles per gallon, is arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory and violative of this section. Larey v. Continental S. Lines, Inc., 243 Ark. 278, 419 S.W.2d 610 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The overall intent of Ark. Const. Amend. 59 was to equalize the assessments and millage rates with respect to personal and real property taxes after completion of reappraisal. Clark v. Union Pac. R.R., 294 Ark. 586, 745 S.W.2d 600 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mandate of equality and uniformity of taxation does not apply only within county lines; the provision clearly refers to statewide equality and uniformity. Summers Chevrolet, Inc. v. Yell County, 310 Ark. 1, 832 S.W.2d 486 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A taxpayer has the right to compel a reduction in his assessment as would afford equality and uniformity with assessments of other like property in other counties of the state. Summers Chevrolet, Inc. v. Yell County, 310 Ark. 1, 832 S.W.2d 486 (1992).

      </p>
      <p>
       The power to classify makes it competent for the legislature to provide the periods for the assessment of each class, as well as the mode. One kind of property may be assessed every year and another only once in two years. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Worthen, 52 Ark. 529, 13 S.W. 254 (1889).

       When income-producing property is assessed and the new cost approach is exclusively used without any consideration of the cost of acquisition or of the value of the property in terms of the income that property will generate for the owner, then the appraisal is not aimed at determining the property's true market value.

       Exemptions, no matter how meritorious, are acts of grace and must be strictly construed, and every reasonable intendment must be made that it was not the design to surrender the power of taxation or to exempt any property from its due proportion of the burden of taxation. Hilger v. Harding College, Inc., 231 Ark. 686, 331 S.W.2d 851 (1960); Sebastian County v. Educare Ctrs. of Ark., Inc., 296 Ark. 538, 758 S.W.2d 413 (1988).

       The fact that the rents and revenues of certain real estate are devoted to purposes of public charity will not exempt such property from taxation; it is only when the property is actually and directly used for charitable purposes that his exemption applies. Brodie v. Fitzgerald, 57 Ark. 445, 22 S.W. 29 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the rents and revenues of a property owned by a charitable corporation are devoted to the purposes for which the corporation was organized will not exempt such property from taxation. It is only when the property itself is actually and directly used for charitable purposes that the law exempts it from taxation. Hilger v. Harding College, Inc., 231 Ark. 686, 331 S.W.2d 851 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where part of appellee's property for which rents were collected was not being directly and exclusively used for public charity, it was properly subjected to taxation as the exemption was based upon the actual use of property rather than the use of its revenues. Burgess v. Four States Mem'l Hosp., 250 Ark. 485, 465 S.W.2d 693 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to qualify for the exemption under the constitution, an entity must show that it is a charitable organization and that the property claimed for exemption is used exclusively for charitable purposes.

      </p>
      <p>
       Property upon which was located an unprofitable apartment complex occupied by persons aged 55 and older did not qualify as a building used exclusively for public charity where there was no evidence that any charitable activity was occurring there, or that the fees paid by residents were devoted to charitable purposes.

       An act providing adequate means for return of funds raised for one purpose, but used for another, is valid. Cobb v. Parnell, 183 Ark. 429, 36 S.W.2d 388 (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the use of the phrase “arising from a tax levied for one purpose” it was intended that, when the tax was collected, it automatically belonged to the purpose for which it was levied and could not thereafter be diverted by the legislature to another purpose. Page v. Alexander, 206 Ark. 479, 177 S.W.2d 415 (1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The County Salary Act of Clay County, providing for the surplus school funds to be transferred to a sinking fund and then to the county general fund after the payment of salaries and expense claims, was an unconstitutional diversion of such school funds. Terry v. Thornton, 207 Ark. 1019, 183 S.W.2d 787 (1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       The application of excess collector's commissions, raised in the collection of a school district's ad valorem taxes, to the combined expenses of the sheriff/collector's office, is a violation of this section since those excess moneys can only be applied to the expenses of the collector's office alone. Special School Dist. v. Sebastian County, 277 Ark. 326, 641 S.W.2d 702 (1982).

       The illegal exaction of a bond surplus should be transferred to the county's general fund and the taxpayers are entitled to a refund. Bell v. Crawford County, 287 Ark. 251, 697 S.W.2d 910 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">475 U.S. 1120</cite>, <cite class="s_court">106 S. Ct. 1638</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">90 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 183 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere absence of an object in the law imposing the tax does not constitute illegal exaction; it is only when a diversion of tax revenues occurs from a specific purpose that has been authorized to an unauthorized purpose that an illegal exaction occurs. Oldner v. Villines, 328 Ark. 296, 943 S.W.2d 574 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city's use of sales tax revenues for purposes other than those specified in its levying ordinance was an illegal exaction. Maas v. City of Mt. Home, 338 Ark. 202, 992 S.W.2d 105 (1999).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the official ballot and voting instructions used at a county-wide special election called for the voters to vote for or against the adoption of a 1% sales tax, but no mention was made of a 1% compensating use tax, a subsequent attempt by the quorum court to impose a 1% use tax pursuant to the favorable vote at the special election was invalid because the ballot title used at the special election did not mention a possible use tax nor were the references to the acts of the legislature sufficient to put the voters on notice that they were also voting on a use tax. Ragan v. Venhaus, 289 Ark. 266, 711 S.W.2d 467 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in dismissing an illegal-exaction complaint against a city alleging that the sole purpose of a local sales and use tax approved at a special election was to satisfy the city's debt to the federal government and that funds collected in excess of that debt were an illegal exaction. The trial court properly utilized the enabling ordinance and ballot title in determining the approved uses for the excess funds, despite plaintiffs'
   contention that the court should be permitted to consider evidence other than the ballot title, and it was undisputed that the plain language of the ordinance and ballot title clearly permitted the city to use the funds to pay payroll and employment taxes.

       Statute providing for acquisition of right-of-way for state highways and authorizing, upon denial of petition by county court, deduction from payments due county from state highway fund or state revenue to the county highway fund, was held not violative of this provision, since statute providing for county highway fund does not provide how it shall be expended.

       The section did not apply to an action pertaining to the division of penalty payments from delinquent taxes equally between a common school fund and a county general fund since (1) the matter did not involve any tax, but rather a penalty assessed because of late payment of all ad valorem taxes, not just school taxes, and (2) the issue was one involving a procedural matter, namely, how to distribute collected penalties.

Clibourn, 125 Ark. 101, 187 S.W. 909 (1916); Director of Bureau of Legislative Research v. Mackrell, 212 Ark. 40, 204 S.W.2d 893 (1947); Borchert v. Scott, 248 Ark. 1041, 460 S.W.2d 28 (1970).

       The exercise by the Department of Correction of an option to purchase certain printing and duplicating equipment based upon an appropriations law authorizing the expenditure of a greater amount of “maintenance and general operation” satisfied the requirements of Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 29, and this section as to sufficient specificity since “maintenance and general operation” is defined to include equipment. Wells v. Heath, 274 Ark. 45, 622 S.W.2d 163 (1981).

      <p>
       A taxpayer may maintain a suit to prevent a misapplication of state funds, as well as those of counties or towns, and he is entitled to an injunction against such unlawful expenditure as a matter of right. Taylor, Cleveland & Co. v. City of Pine Bluff, 34 Ark. 603 (1879); Farrell v. Oliver, 146 Ark. 599, 226 S.W. 529 (1921); Jones v. Capers, 231 Ark. 870, 333 S.W.2d 242 (1960); Ark. Ass'n of County Judges v. Green, 232 Ark. 438, 338 S.W.2d 672 (1960); Starnes v. Sadler, 237 Ark. 325, 372 S.W.2d 585 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision is self-executing and imposes no terms or conditions upon the right of citizens there conferred. Samples v. Grady, 207 Ark. 724, 182 S.W.2d 875 (1944); Starnes v. Sadler, 237 Ark. 325, 372 S.W.2d 585 (1963); Martin v. Couey Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 308 Ark. 325, 824 S.W.2d 832 (1992); Saunders v. Neuse, 320 Ark. 547, 898 S.W.2d 43 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A citizen who is a property owner, taxpayer, and ratepayer has the right to bring an action to enjoin the members of city utility commission from making contracts and spending commission funds with its own members or with companies in which they have a beneficial interest. Price v. Edmonds, 231 Ark. 332, 330 S.W.2d 82 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions of basic authority pertaining to the construction and equipment of a hospital may be raised in an action under this section to enjoin the levy of a tax. Davis v. Waller, 238 Ark. 300, 379 S.W.2d 283 (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       An illegal exaction was one either unauthorized or contrary to law and no fraud or bad faith need be shown by taxpayer seeking relief. Mackey v. McDonald, 255 Ark. 978, 504 S.W.2d 726 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the lease of the county hospital nor the funds generated by the lease payments constituted an illegal exaction; therefore, the hospital lease fund and the accrued interest thereon were not illegal exactions, and the county should be the disbursing agent for said funds. Bell v. Crawford County, 287 Ark. 251, 697 S.W.2d 910 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">475 U.S. 1120</cite>, <cite class="s_court">106 S. Ct. 1638</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">90 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 183 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       An illegal exaction suit may proceed despite the existence of other adequate remedies. Jackson v. Munson, 288 Ark. 57, 701 S.W.2d 378 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The illegal exaction provisions encompass two different types of exactions: one type involves the prevention of a misapplication of public funds or the recovery of funds wrongly paid to a public official, and the other involves a taxpayer who seeks to enjoin a government from taxing him. Pledger v. Featherlite Precast Corp., 308 Ark. 124, 823 S.W.2d 852, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">506 U.S. 826</cite>, <cite class="s_court">113 S. Ct. 82</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">121 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 46 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is self-executing and requires no enabling act or supplemental legislation to make its provisions effective. Hartwick v. Thorne, 300 Ark. 502, 780 S.W.2d 531 (1989), supp. op., 300 Ark. 512-A (1990); Martin v. Couey Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 308 Ark. 325, 824 S.W.2d 832 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where petitioner seems to suggest that the justices could be liable for illegal exactions in the nature of salaries received that exceeded caps or limitations under the amendment he proposed, petitioner's claim was not only premature, it was also a claim for illegal exactions under Ark. Const., Art. 16, § 13, and could only be commenced in a trial court, not in the appellate courts. White v. Priest, 348 Ark. 135, 73 S.W.3d 572, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">537 U.S. 949</cite>, <cite class="s_court">123 S. Ct. 381</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">154 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 295 (2002).

       Under the terms of this section, the parties to an illegal exaction suit include all citizens of the county, city, or town affected by the illegal exaction and, because all citizens are parties to the constitutionally created class, the right to opt out as developed under Ark. R. Civ. P. 23 is not applicable in an illegal exaction suit; further, communication with the affected citizens has to be unfettered to determine whether any alleged illegal exaction may have been voluntarily paid and, therefore, not subject to suit under this section.

The allegation that the USFWS took advantage of the department's highway-expansion project to force unreasonable terms on the state and the complaint's attempts to assert various contract defenses on the state's behalf were not sufficient to establish a claim for an illegal exaction.

       The general rule is that funds which have been acquired through an illegal exaction are to be returned pro rata to the various taxpayers who initially paid them, but where funds were collected through a sales tax, it is probable that the proof will show that it is impossible to determine, with any degree of economic certainty, who paid the taxes; therefore, it is probable that the funds, if any, cannot be refunded to the initial payers, and a hearing must be held to determine how the funds are to be disposed.

      <li id="constitution-ar-a16s14ol1a">
       Whenever a countywide reappraisal or reassessment of property subject to ad valorem taxes made in accordance with procedures established by the General Assembly shall result in an increase in the aggregate value of taxable real and personal property in any taxing unit in this State of ten percent (10%) or more over the previous year the rate of city or town, county, school district, and community college district taxes levied against the taxable real and personal property of each such taxing unit shall, upon completion of such reappraisal or reassessment, be adjusted or rolled back, by the governing body of the taxing unit, for the year for which levied as provided below. The General Assembly shall, by law, establish the procedures to be followed by a county in making a countywide reappraisal or reassessment of property which will, upon completion, authorize the adjustment or rollback of property tax rates or millage, as authorized hereinabove. The adjustment or rollback of tax rates or millage for the “base year” as hereinafter defined shall be designed to assure that each taxing unit will receive an amount of tax revenue from each tax source no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues received during the previous year from each such tax source, adjusted for any lawful tax or millage rate increase or reduction imposed in the manner provided by law for the year for which the tax adjustment or rollback is to be made, and after making the following additional adjustments:

Provided, further, that in calculating the amount of adjusted or rollback millage necessary to produce tax revenues no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues received during the previous year, the governing body shall separate from the assessed value of taxable real property of the taxing unit, newly-discovered real property and new construction and improvements to real property, after making the adjustments for personal property or property of public utilities and regulated carriers noted above, and shall compute the millage necessary to produce an amount of revenues equal to, but no greater than the base year revenues of the taxing unit from each millage source. Such taxing unit may elect either to obtain an increase in revenues equal to the amount of revenues that the computed or adjusted rollback millage will produce from newly-discovered real property and new construction and improvements to real property, or if the same be less than ten percent (10%), the governing body of the taxing unit may recompute the millage rate to be charged to produce an amount no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues collected for taxable real property during the base year.

      Provided, however, that the amount of revenues to be derived from taxable personal property assessed in the taxing unit for the base year, other than personal property taxes to be paid by public utilities and regulated carriers in the manner provided hereinabove, shall be computed at the millage necessary to produce the same dollar amount of revenues derived during the current year in which the base year adjustment or rollback of millage is computed, and the millage necessary to produce the amount of revenues received from personal property taxes received by the taxing unit, for the base year shall be reduced annually as the assessed value of taxable personal property increases until the amount of revenues from personal property taxes, computed on the basis of the current year millage rates will produce an amount of revenues from taxable personal property equal to or greater than received during the base year, and thereafter the millage rates for computing personal property taxes shall be the millage rates levied for the current year.

       Statutory provision that, upon completion of a countywide reappraisal or reassessment of property, each taxing unit will receive an amount of tax revenue from each tax source no greater than 10% above the revenues received during the previous year is not a guarantee to school districts that they would get an exact 10% increase in tax money; thus, where following a reappraisal and reassessment of property, school districts received increases ranging from 4.9% to 8.7%, the districts could not argue that the increases were insufficient.

       In order to equalize the rate of taxation, it is necessary to (1) lower the assessed valuation of personal property, (2) increase the assessed valuation of the real estate, or (3) hold the personal property rates at the present level, with adjustments, until the real estate tax rates reach the same level.

       Ark. Const. Amend. 59 requires that personal property be exempted from new levies until such time as the rates on personal property and real property are equalized. Clark v. Union Pac. R.R., 294 Ark. 586, 745 S.W.2d 600 (1988).

       Where property taxes were rolled back from one mill to .4 mill to comply with this section, the city's subsequent return to the old rate of one mill, which was in excess of 10% over the base year, on the newly increased appraised value of the property violated this section.

       From both the wording of Ark. Const. Amend. 59 and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c26s26-26-401" target="_blank">26-26-401</a></cite> et seq., real estate taxes cannot be increased more than ten percent (10%) per year until such time as the personal and real property evaluation and millage rates are equalized. The amendment prevents the taxing units from receiving more than a ten percent (10%) increase in tax collections for any one year; in the event the applicable millage would result in the collection of more than a ten percent (10%) increase in revenues, a rollback procedure is mandated. Clark v. Union Pac. R.R., 294 Ark. 586, 745 S.W.2d 600 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The revenues produced from real estate taxes cannot be increased more than ten percent (10%) in the “base year” (the year following completion of reappraisal or reassessment); however, the adjustment or rollback in the “base year” is to be “adjusted for any lawful tax or millage rate increase or reduction imposed in the manner provided by law.” Therefore, in the absence of a lawful increase in the millage rate (which would apply only to real estate until the rates are equalized), the personal property rate reduction will depend upon the increase in revenues from real property, after making the specified adjustments. Clark v. Union Pac. R.R., 294 Ark. 586, 745 S.W.2d 600 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The pleadings, affidavits, and other materials gave rise to more than a mere suspicion that reappraisals conducted in a specific county were countywide reappraisals subject to the rollback provision of Amendment 59 and, therefore, the county was not entitled to summary judgment in an action alleging an unconstitutional collection of property taxes. Worth v. City of Rogers, 341 Ark. 12, 14 S.W.3d 471 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in finding that a reappraisal begun by a county in 1996 was not a countywide reappraisal where the defendants not only failed to introduce evidence that the reappraisal was not countywide, but also conceded on the record that the reassessment begun in 1996 was subject to the provisions of Amendment 59.

       Subsection (a) of this section of Article 16 does not state that property may be classified as “residential” only when the owner lives on the land; rather, this subsection explains that “residential property” that is used solely as the principal place of residence of the owner must be assessed in accordance with its value as a residence, as opposed to another method of valuation. The requirement in this subsection does not apply to “residential property” that is not used solely as the principal place of residence of the owner; therefore, an argument that a residential classification was inappropriate because two taxpayers did not live on the land was rejected.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

       One who believes that he is punished by an omnipotent Supreme Being for his acts but who does not believe in God is competent to testify. Mueller v. Coffman, 132 Ark. 45, 200 S.W. 136 (1918).

       Where two atheist plaintiffs in challenging the constitutionality of this section merely alleged possible future injury, along with the allegation that they had suffered adverse psychological consequences as a result of the continued presence of this section in the Constitution, the plaintiffs failed to show the requisite injury in fact necessary to give them standing, and, therefore, the trial court properly dismissed their action.

       Unlike legislatively referred constitutional amendments that have been submitted to and adopted by the voters, there is no presumption of constitutionality afforded by the Arkansas Supreme Court during its review of pre-election-proposed amendments that have not been voted on and adopted or approved by the public.

       The courts would not overturn the approval of the constitutional amendment requiring competitive bidding for the purchase of printing, stationery, and supplies by a substantial majority of voters on the alleged ground of misleading ballot title, particularly in absence of constitutional or statutory provision for specifications for a ballot title for the amendment proposed by the general assembly and published before submission. Chaney v. Bryant, 259 Ark. 294, 532 S.W.2d 741 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not specifically require a ballot title; all that is required is that proposed amendments under this section be so submitted as to enable the electors to vote on each amendment separately; thus, the purpose of the ballot title is not to inform the voter, but merely to distinguish and identify the amendment. Becker v. Riviere, 277 Ark. 252, 641 S.W.2d 2 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not required that a ballot title contain a synopsis of the proposed amendment and cover every detail of it. Becker v. McCuen, 303 Ark. 482, 798 S.W.2d 71 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Standard of review applied to ballot titles under this section is: (1) whether the ballot title is sufficient to “distinguish and identify” the proposal, and (2) whether the ballot title is a “manifest fraud upon the public.” This is a different and less demanding standard than is employed for Ark. Const. Amend. 7 initiatives. Becker v. McCuen, 303 Ark. 482, 798 S.W.2d 71 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no deceit in using the same title on two proposed amendments separated by eight years when both deal with the same subject matter. Becker v. McCuen, 303 Ark. 482, 798 S.W.2d 71 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the date “1989” in the popular name “The 1989 Interest Rate Control Amendment” which was being voted on in 1990, not 1989, was not misleading and did not give partisan coloring to the proposal. Becker v. McCuen, 303 Ark. 482, 798 S.W.2d 71 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court refused to overrule earlier cases that require ballot title reviews to be evaluated under the manifest-fraud-on-the-public standard. Thiel v. Priest, 342 Ark. 292, 28 S.W.3d 296 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ballot title for a proposed constitutional amendment, now codified as Ark. Const. Amend. 89, complied with this section in that it identified and distinguished the amendment and was not worded in some way as to constitute a manifest fraud upon the public.

       Amendments proposed by the legislature are entirely different from those initiated under Amendment 7 and are governed by an entirely different procedure. Amendment 7, which amended Ark.

       A joint resolution to submit an amendment to the Constitution, introduced in the senate and approved without change by senate and house, was properly authorized where the resolution was spread at length on the senate journal but only a synopsis was entered upon the house journal.

      </p>

       The failure of the general assembly in a regular session to enter proposed constitutional amendments at length on the journals with the yea and nay votes could not be cured by subsequent amendatory action at a special session and invalidated the amendment.

       Referred constitutional amendment was unconstitutional under Ark. Const., Art. 19, § 22, because (1) the amendment's sections were not all “reasonably germane” to each other, as a limit on legal services contracts was not germane to legislative power over judicial rulemaking, and (2) all the amendment's contents were not reasonably germane to one general subject, as a contingency fee limit had nothing to do with “courts and the judiciary”; further, (3) the amendment violated the limit on submitting up to three constitutional amendments at one time in a way the amendments could be voted separately, as the amendment made at least seven constitutional changes.

      </p>
      <p>
       The provision, that a majority in value of property owners must consent to a local improvement by assessment, is mandatory and jurisdictional. Craig v.

      <p>
       The word “owner” used in the Constitution in regard to local improvement districts means the absolute owner or the owner in fee. Smith v. Improvement Dist. No. 14, 108 Ark. 141, 156 S.W. 455 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       The owner of property must sign petitions for improvement, although not necessarily in his own hand. Colquitt v. Stevens, 111 Ark. 314, 163 S.W. 1141 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       The power to tax property to be specially benefitted by a levy may be delegated to a levee board, and liability for the assessment depends upon the fact that property will be benefitted and not upon the fact that lands are subject to overflow. Carson v. St. Francis Levee Dist., 59 Ark. 513, 27 S.W. 590 (1894).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only theory upon which an assessment may be made is that a special benefit will result to the particular tract because of the improvement, and to assess a tract in excess of the value of such benefits is an attempt to take private property for a public use without just compensation. Kirst v. Street Improv. Dist. No. 1, 86 Ark. 1, 109 S.W. 526 (1908); Whitaker & Co. v. Sewer Improv. Dist. No. 1, 221 F.2d 649 (8th Cir. 1955).

       An improvement to be made entirely outside a town, while the improvement district lies partly within and partly without the town limits, is a valid assessment if any benefits would be derived by the property within the municipality. Cox v. Road Improv. Dist. No. 8, 118 Ark. 119, 176 S.W. 676 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       As legislature is vested with all powers not prohibited by Constitution and Constitution requires only that assessments be ad valorem, uniform and with consent of a majority in value of the affected property holders, legislature could authorize municipality to tax lands lying outside city limits by assessment of benefits on said lands in sewer improvement district.

      </p>
      <p>
       A road improvement district laying partly within and partly without a town and not consented to by a majority in value of the property owners to be affected is valid since the constitutional provision applies to improvements purely local to a municipality.

      All laws now in force, which are not in conflict or inconsistent with this Constitution, shall continue in force until amended or repealed by the General Assembly, and all laws exempting property from sale on execution, or by decree of a court, which were in force at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, shall remain in force with regard to contracts made before that time. Until otherwise provided by law no distinction shall exist between sealed and unsealed instruments, concerning contracts between individuals, executed since the adoption of the Constitution of 1868; Provided: That the statutes of limitation with regard to sealed and unsealed instruments in force at that time, continue to apply to all instruments afterward executed, and until altered or repealed.

       Even if Scott County had less than 900 square miles in 1851 as result of Act of 1851 creating Sebastian County out of part of area of Scott County, since reduction of area of Scott County below constitutional amount of 1836 did not appear on the face of the Act of 1851, and no litigation was filed challenging validity of act until present time, such constitutional argument cannot now be filed, especially since Constitution of 1874 cured the unchallenged defect now raised by defendant in a trespass suit.

      Publisher's Notes.
     </b>
     Amendments to the Constitution have been inconsistently numbered both as proposed and as compiled in previous digests and compilations. This volume uses the numbers assigned by the Secretary of State in 1932 and used in Pope's Digest of 1937, which omitted certain prior amendments which were deemed superseded by later amendments.

      In General.

    </h4>
    <p>
     In determining whether a law is public, general, special, or local, the courts will look to its substance and practical operation rather than to its title, form, and phraseology. State ex rel. Burrow v. Jolly, 207 Ark. 515, 181 S.W.2d 479 (1944); Inman v. Kelley, 229 Ark. 149, 313 S.W.2d 796 (1958); Laman v. Harrill, 233 Ark. 967, 349 S.W.2d 814 (1961); Littleton v. Blanton, 281 Ark. 395, 665 S.W.2d 239 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     Legislation may be classified as general, special, or local, with a law being general when it operates on all counties, cities, and towns alike, while a law is special in a constitutional sense when by force of an inherent limitation it arbitrarily separates some person, place, or thing from those upon which it would operate except for the separation, and a local law is one that applies to any subdivision or division of the state less than the whole. Laman v. Harrill, 233 Ark. 967, 349 S.W.2d 814 (1961); City of Little Rock v. Waters, 303 Ark. 363, 797 S.W.2d 426 (1990), overruled, Daniel v. Jones, 332 Ark. 489, 966 S.W.2d 226 (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     The constitutional prohibition of local legislation is a restriction on the General Assembly and not on municipal corporations of the state. Rooker v. City of Little Rock, 234 Ark. 372, 352 S.W.2d 172 (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     The court may look outside of the act and consider any fact of which judicial notice may be taken to determine if its operation and effect is special, regardless of its form. Littleton v. Blanton, 281 Ark. 395, 665 S.W.2d 239 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     This amendment prohibits the general assembly from passing local or special acts. An act is special if by some inherent limitation it arbitrarily separates some person, place, or thing from those upon which, but for such separation, it would operate; a local act is one that applies to any division or subdivision of the state less than the whole. Board of Trustees v. City of Little Rock, 295 Ark. 585, 750 S.W.2d 950 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     An act is “special” if by some inherent limitation or classification it arbitrarily separates some person, place, or thing from those upon which, but for such separation, it would operate, and the legislation is “local” if it applies to any division or subdivision of the state less than the whole. Owen v. Dalton, 296 Ark. 351, 757 S.W.2d 921 (1988).

     Simply because the legislature states that an act is general in application, a court is not bound by that statement; rather, the court will look to the operation and effect of the legislation and, if that operation and effect is necessarily local, then the act is local regardless of its form. If the legislature is to decide whether an act is local or special legislation, then this amendment serves no purpose and it might just as well not have been adopted. Owen v. Dalton, 296 Ark. 351, 757 S.W.2d 921 (1988).

      Classification.
     </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Where the legislature is dealing with the salaries of county officers under the constitutional directive, it is not necessary to classify the counties as to population or in any other manner, but it is necessary that no county be excluded; but this is not to say that some of the counties may not be excluded if exclusion is based on a proper classification. Inman v. Kelley, 229 Ark. 149, 313 S.W.2d 796 (1958).
    </p>
    <p>
     Classification among geographical or political subdivisions is permitted if the general assembly could have had a rational basis for it, and the fact that the classification includes only one city does not necessarily mean that it is “local” in the constitutional sense. Board of Trustees v. City of Little Rock, 295 Ark. 585, 750 S.W.2d 950 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     If the classifications are such that the legislation applies only to political subdivisions of a certain population, the legislation is local if relative population has nothing to do with the subject-matter of the law. Owen v. Dalton, 296 Ark. 351, 757 S.W.2d 921 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     The classification in Acts 1997, No. 727, § 2, that limited the application of the section only to border cities along the Mississippi River, a small portion of the state, was not rationally related to the purpose of the legislation, which was to assist certain cities compete with other cities; further, Acts 1997, No. 727, § 2, is clearly local and special legislation enacted in violation of this amendment. Weiss v. Geisbauer, 363 Ark. 508, 215 S.W.3d 628 (2005).
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if the Supreme Court were to look to an act's emergency clause for its distinct purpose, boilerplate language in an emergency clause that says that the appropriation is “essential to the operation of the agency” is too broad and vague to meet the test of distinctly explaining “how” the money is to be spent.

     Neither the circuit court nor the libraries provided a rational and legitimate reason for funding libraries in Jacksonville and Cleburne County as opposed to other libraries throughout the state, therefore, the circuit court erred in finding Acts 2005, Nos. 825 and 932 were constitutional.
   Wilson v. Weiss, 370 Ark. 205, 258 S.W.3d 351 (2007).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because there was no legitimate reason that Reed's Bridge and the Jacksonville Museum should be treated differently from other equally worthy military and historic attractions in Arkansas, the circuit court's orders regarding Acts 2005, Nos. 644 and 1473(1)(C) were reversed. The Supreme Court held that those acts violated this amendment.

    </p>
    <p>
     Before an act may be declared unconstitutional special legislation, the challenger of the legislation must show not only that it affects only a single portion of the state, but also that the act is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.

    </p>
    <p>
     Question presented on a challenge under this amendment is whether the General Assembly could have had a rational basis for making the classification. The phrase “could have had” shows that a court looks to see whether the legislation violated the amendment at the time the legislation was adopted.

    </p>
    <p>
     The proceeds of such tax shall be expended by a board of three commissioners, each of whom shall be taxpayer in such city, said commissioners, to serve for such term as may be provided by law without compensation, except actual expenses. One of the commissioners shall be selected by a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board, one by a majority of the judges of the Circuit, County and Chancery Courts of the county, sitting as a board, and one by a majority of the banks and trust companies located in such city whose representatives shall sit as a board. Where there are two such cities in such county and the tax herein provided for has been voted in each, one board of commissioners may be appointed for both cities if a majority of the boards having the appointive power deem best, and in that event a majority of the banks and trust companies in both cities shall appoint one commissioner, and the proceeds of the tax shall be expended for the benefit of both cities.
    </p>
    <p>
     The proceeds of such tax may be expended as may be provided by law for the purpose of securing the location of factories, industries, river transportation and facilities therefor within and adjacent to such cities or other public purposes, exclusive of charities and those now within the powers of said cities to perform, and expenditures may also be made for advertising such cities and the State, or making secured loans to such factories and industries, or for any other public purpose that may be provided by law, connected with securing the location of such factories and industries and encouraging them.

     Since the statute provides that state revenue department building bonds will not be supported or guaranteed by full faith and credit of the state, and that the bonds can only be paid from certain special funds described therein, it does not violate the constitutional amendment prohibiting issuance of any bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state except when authorized by a vote of the qualified electors.

       This amendment was not adopted contrary to state constitutional provision for amending the Constitution since the two sections both relate to prosecuting attorneys and are not two questions in one amendment. Brockelhurst v. State, 195 Ark. 67, 111 S.W.2d 527 (1937).

       Absent a showing of invalid adoption, a state constitutional amendment is the state constitution with regard to the subject matter it addresses; thus, defendant's claim that this amendment violated the Arkansas Constitution failed where there was no allegation of invalid adoption.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because driving under the influence (DUI) is not a lesser-included offense of driving while intoxicated (DWI), defendant, who was only charged with DWI, was prepared to defend against the charge of DWI and was prejudiced by circuit court's decision altering the charge to DUI. McElhanon v. State, 329 Ark. 261, 948 S.W.2d 89 (1997), overruled in part, McCoy v. State, 347 Ark. 913, 69 S.W.3d 430 (2002).

       Trial court's decision to deny appellant's motion for postconviction relief was not clearly erroneous because appellant's argument that counsel was remiss in failing to argue that the information had to be dismissed on the ground that the prosecutor intentionally delayed charging him was limited to a conclusory allegation, and appellant failed to provide any facts to support his claim.

       The duty of charging an accused with a felony is reserved either to the grand jury or the prosecutor, and trial judge encroached upon the prosecutor's constitutional duties and breached the separation of powers doctrine where he amended charge from a felony to a misdemeanor over the state's objection.

    </p>
    <p>
     A state may inquire into communist party membership of a bar applicant, in view of the lawyer's position of trust and confidence and in view of the lawyer's position of authority; however, a question which asks, “Are you now, or have you at any time been, a member or supporter of any party, organization, or group that believes in or teaches the overthrow of the United States Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods?” offends the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in that it is overbroad.

     In a disbarment proceeding, the trial court clearly had jurisdiction with the authority to conditionally suspend attorney's license for 12 months and to condition his reinstatement only upon the attorney's satisfactorily passing the regular examination for admission to the bar.

    <p>
     This amendment grants the Supreme Court the exclusive power to regulate the practice of law and the professional conduct of attorneys; thus, the right to decide whether an attorney, who regularly practices before a court, can be appointed to represent an indigent in a criminal case is a judicial question, not a legislative one, and the legislature invaded the province of the judicial branch of government in declaring certain attorneys could not be appointed as counsel in a criminal case. Ball v. Roberts, 291 Ark. 84, 722 S.W.2d 829 (1987).

     The Arkansas Supreme Court is affirmatively charged with the duty of making and, by implication, of enforcing rules governing the practice of law and the conduct of lawyers. Sexton v. Ark.

     Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct did not exceed its proper function, or become a court in its own right, by suspending an attorney's license. Sexton v. Ark. Supreme Court Comm. on Prof'l Conduct, 299 Ark. 439, 774 S.W.2d 114 (1989), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">494 U.S. 1066</cite>, <cite class="s_court">110 S.

     Attorneys practicing in the bankruptcy courts in Arkansas are subject to the Uniform Federal Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, but that fact in no way divests the State Committee on Professional Conduct or the Supreme Court of the authority to discipline lawyers for incompetent practice and abuse of process, and inherent in this authority is the power to admit or disbar lawyers. Dodrill v. Executive Dir., 308 Ark. 301, 824 S.W.2d 383 (1992).

     The adequacy of an attorney's fee falls well within the ambit of the practice of law over which the Supreme Court has general supervisory authority. Price v. State, 313 Ark. 96, 313 Ark. 98A, 856 S.W.2d 10 (1993).

     The Arkansas Supreme Court derives its power through this section to establish and maintain, through its committee on professional conduct, jurisdiction over a lawyer's person by virtue of the issuance of his license to practice law. McCullough v. Neal, 314 Ark. 372, 862 S.W.2d 279 (1993); Mays v. Neal, 327 Ark. 302, 938 S.W.2d 830 (1997).

     Circuit court erred in finding that an arbitrator, rather than the court, should decide who could represent a party in arbitration proceedings because the issue falls squarely within the ambit of the state supreme court's constitutional powers and cannot be decided by an arbitration body.

     Section 16-22-310 does not usurp the Supreme Court's authority to regulate the practice of law as the statute enunciates the parameters for litigation by clients against attorneys and does not conflict with any rule or decision by the Supreme Court.

     Circuit court did not err in dismissing a company's tax assessment appeal for lack of jurisdiction when its tax manager, a nonlawyer, initiated the appeal on its behalf because the company invoked the legal process and its nonattorney representative engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.

       Circuit court properly rejected plaintiff's claim that there was an illegal exaction from public funds when the county treasurer sent the funds from the county hospital tax approved by Ark. Const. Amend. 32 to the state to be used to obtain Medicaid matching funds from the federal government before the funds were returned to the county children's hospital; the hospital directed that the money be sent to the state, and the hospital's direction of the funds was tantamount to its receiving the funds, and plaintiff cited no authority for the argument that funds from the hospital tax could not be commingled with other funds.

      <p>
       Circuit court properly rejected plaintiff's claim that there was an illegal exaction from public funds as a matter of law because the county children's hospital treated children from outside Pulaski County; the plain language of the ordinance did not restrict use of the hospital tax approved by Ark. Const. Amend. 32 to the treatment of Pulaski County residents. Also, plaintiff failed to challenge the lower court's conclusion that adequate medical care was made available to all children residing in the county.

       The use of the word “affiliate” is not used in the same sense as the word “join,” otherwise, the General Assembly would not have used the two words in the same sentence. Kaiser v. Price-Fewell, Inc., 235 Ark. 295, 359 S.W.2d 449 (1962), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">371 U.S. 955</cite>, <cite class="s_court">83 S. Ct. 511</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">9 L.

        Closed Shop.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where miners strike for a closed shop, and thereafter an agreement is entered into between miners and operators providing for a closed shop and for the establishment of a pension fund, no suit could be maintained on agreement to recover amounts due pension fund from defendant operators as closed shop agreements are illegal under the Constitution, and since closed shop feature was an essential part of the agreement, the entire contract was void and unenforceable. Lewis v. Jackson & Squire, Inc., 86 F. Supp. 354 (W.D. Ark. 1949), appeal dismissed, 181 F.2d 1011 (8th Cir. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       A provision in a collective bargaining agreement that a union would furnish the employer with such workers as necessary to complete work contracted for by the employer was not a provision for a closed shop and was not illegal. Ketcher v. Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n, 115 F. Supp. 802 (E.D. Ark. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where picketing is for the purpose of forcing an employer to agree to a closed shop provision, which is in violation of state law, the National Labor Relations Act does not apply. Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Goff-McNair Motor Co., 223 Ark. 30, 264 S.W.2d 48 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Record justified chancellor's decision that labor union established picket line to force employment of only union men contrary to the provisions of this amendment. Burgess v. Daniel Plumbing & Gas Co., 225 Ark. 792, 285 S.W.2d 517 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute making any person who is a member of a union ineligible to serve on the police department was unconstitutional in violation of this amendment. Potts v. Hay, 229 Ark. 830, 318 S.W.2d 826 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where requirement contained in wage agreement that as a condition of employment all employees should be or become members of the union was followed by the phrase “to the extent and in the manner permitted by law,” such phrase negated the possibility of a union shop; thus, making the agreement acceptable under the right to work laws. Lewis v. Hixson, 174 F. Supp. 241 (W.D. Ark. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement providing that the local union will be bargaining agent for employees, but does not require that employees be or become union members, nor that the contractor must request workmen from the union, is not a violation of this amendment. Williams v. Arthur J. Arney Co., 240 Ark. 157, 398 S.W.2d 515 (1966).

        Hiring Halls.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The hiring hall arrangement sought by the union is prohibited by the Constitution and the laws of this state in that such arrangement, which made register of applicants maintained at the hall the exclusive source of employees, had the effect of excluding persons from employment who failed to join or affiliate with a union, thus, accomplishing by indirection what they were prohibited by law from doing directly. Kaiser v. Price-Fewell, Inc., 235 Ark. 295, 359 S.W.2d 449 (1962), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">371 U.S. 955</cite>, <cite class="s_court">83 S. Ct. 511</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">9 L.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A demand by a union that a collective bargaining agreement contain a provision in violation of this section, coupled with picketing in an attempt to enforce such demand, is grounds for the issuance of an injunction prohibiting such picketing. Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Goff-McNair Motor Co., 223 Ark. 30, 264 S.W.2d 48 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Peaceful picketing as a protest against substandard wages was not prohibited by this amendment. Self v. Wisener, 226 Ark. 58, 287 S.W.2d 890 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that labor dispute did not exist between employer and employees did not of itself render picketing unlawful. Self v. Wisener, 226 Ark. 58, 287 S.W.2d 890 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was not sufficient to establish that picketing was for purpose of forcing employees to join union. Self v. Wisener, 226 Ark. 58, 287 S.W.2d 890 (1956); McDaniel Bros. Constr. Co. v. Tolbert, 228 Ark. 555, 309 S.W.2d 326 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Peaceful picketing to protest the hiring of nonunion labor cannot be restrained by a state court under authority of this amendment if the parties are subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. Mitcham v. Ark-La Constr. Co., 239 Ark. 1162, 397 S.W.2d 789 (1965).

       The commission has been given full and complete administrative power and authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the conservation and preservation of all wildlife including not only the power to establish a bag limit, set the seasons in which to hunt and fish, and the penalty for violations but also the power to levy a license fee on all hunting dogs just so long as such license fees are not unreasonable or arbitrary and are for regulatory purposes and not for revenue. Ark. State Game & Fish Comm'n v. W.R. Wrape Stave Co., 76 F. Supp. 323 (E.D. Ark. 1948); W.R. Wrape Stave Co. v. Ark. State Game & Fish Comm'n, 215 Ark. 229, 219 S.W.2d 948 (1949); State ex rel.

      </p>
      <p>
       This amendment, adopted in 1944, created the Game and Fish Commission as an independent constitutional agency with the clear power to control, manage, restore, conserve, and regulate the birds, fish, game, and wildlife resources of the state; and the commission has broad discretion in carrying out this purpose. Chaffin v. Ark. Game & Fish Comm'n, 296 Ark. 431, 757 S.W.2d 950 (1988).

       Authority granted to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission under Ark. Const. Amend. 35, § 1, is not exclusive because the language of the section does not include words of exclusivity and because such an interpretation would lead to absurd results that would potentially invalidate the authority of many state agencies.

       Circuit court properly denied the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's (AGFC) motion to dismiss because property owners'
   claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity; the essence of the claims was that AGFC illegally blocked the owners'
   access to the road that was their only access to their property and the complaint alleged that AGFC acted illegally or in an ultra vires manner.

       The commission has full and complete administrative power and authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the conservation and preservation of all wildlife including not only the power to establish a bag limit, set the seasons in which to hunt and fish, and the penalty for violations, but also the power to levy a license fee on all hunting dogs, just so long as such license fees are not unreasonable and arbitrary and are for regulatory purposes and not for revenue.

       Although Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 31, provides that no appropriation shall be made except for “defraying the necessary expenses of government what is necessary,” there is no conflict between Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 31, and this amendment where the legislature is attempting to substitute its judgment for that of the Game and Fish Commission on a question of management of resources, something it cannot do. Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 31, and this amendment are not irreconcilable; this amendment gave the commission more power to act independently than other state agencies that are not independent constitutional agencies.

       Although the Game and Fish Commission has broad discretion in carrying out its power, its power to regulate the manner of taking game does not translate into a general power to regulate the general possession of all firearms on city, county, state, or federally maintained roads or rights-of way.

     This amendment was proposed by H.J.R. No. 3 (see Acts 1951, p. 970) and filed in the office of the Secretary of State on March 20, 1951. It was approved at the general election on Nov. 4, 1952, by a vote of 178,278 for and 123,245 against.
    </p>
    <p>
     The amendment contained a preliminary paragraph which read “That the Constitution of the State of Arkansas be amended modifying Section 19 of Article 7 and Section 3 of Amendment No. 24 of said Constitution, so as to provide for the election of a County Clerk in all of the said counties of the State, as follow: ….”
    </p>
    <p>
     Amendment 80 to the Arkansas Constitution, effective July 1, 2001, established circuit courts as the trial courts of original jurisdiction of all justiciable matters not otherwise assigned pursuant to the Constitution and specifically provided that “jurisdiction conferred on Circuit Courts established by this Amendment includes all matter previously cognizable by Circuit, Chancery, Probate and Juvenile Courts…”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ark. Const. Amend. 95, which amended this amendment effective January 1, 2017, was proposed by H.J.R. 1027 during the 2015 Regular Session and adopted at the November 2016 general election by a vote of 747,856 for and 317,093 against.

      <p>
       This section did not “freeze” the congressional districts as they existed in 1951, but rather it reflected a method and desire of the framers to insure equal representation of the Highway Commission from all parts of the state with an odd number (to avoid tie votes) constituting that membership.

      </p>
      <p>
       Since this state presently has four Congressional Districts and five Highway Commissioners, it would be impossible to comply strictly with this section requiring that no two members be from the same district, inasmuch as two members of the Commission would certainly have to be residents of the same district.

     An ad valorem tax is on property that may be found in the state and it is immaterial that the property may not be moved on any regular route or schedule. There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States or its laws which prevents a state from taxing personal property employed in interstate of foreign commerce like other personal property within its jurisdiction.

     This section does not prohibit the state from adopting revenue measures, nor does it does not prohibit the state from giving financial assistance to political subdivisions or agencies or from assisting them in collecting taxes that they are lawfully entitled to collect.

     Because the returns of after-tax contributions to a retirement plan were property, and not income, the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration's attempted tax of the returns under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c51s26-51-307" target="_blank">26-51-307</a></cite> was unconstitutional, given the prohibition in this amendment that prohibited an ad valorem tax being levied on property; thus, the trial court properly granted partial summary judgment in favor of the taxpayers. Weiss v. McFadden, 353 Ark. 868, 120 S.W.3d 545 (2003).

     In a dispute over the state's attempt to recoup from certain school districts and redistribute twenty-five-mill uniform rate of tax (URT) revenues that were in excess of the foundation-funding amount, the circuit court erred by finding that the URT revenues were state-tax revenues. School taxes were a breed of their own that were neither state nor local; the URT was not converted into a state tax solely because the revenues were remitted to the state treasurer and then back to the school districts.

      <p>
       Verifying voter registration as set out in Acts 2017, No. 633 is germane to Ark. Const. Amend. 51; providing a system of verifying that a person attempting to cast a ballot is registered to vote is relevant and pertinent, or has a close relationship, to a constitutional amendment establishing a system of voter registration.
   Martin v. Haas, 2018 Ark. 283, 556 S.W.3d 509 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Providing a method of enforcement—verification of voter identity by photo identification or by affirmation—is consistent with the policy and purpose of Ark. Const. Amend. 51. Ark. Const. Amend. 51, § 3, itself contemplates some enforcement mechanism, and Acts 2017, No. 633 provides a method of ensuring that no person is permitted to vote who is not registered.
   Martin v. Haas, 2018 Ark. 283, 556 S.W.3d 509 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2017, No. 633, which amended Const. Amend. 51, §§ 6, 13 (adding subdivision (a)(2)(F) of this section and subsection (b) of § 13), met the requirements of Const. Amend. 51, § 19 and was a valid constitutional amendment. The appellate court could not say that Act 633's constitutional amendment was
       <i>
        clearly
       </i>
       not germane to Amendment 51 and not consistent with its policy and purposes; therefore, the preliminary injunction entered by the circuit court was reversed.

       Where defendant was convicted of a felony in federal court of filing fraudulent income tax returns in an attempt to evade taxes and of making and subscribing false tax returns, the action of the registrar in canceling defendant's name from the voter registration list of county was lawful and proper because the offense committed was a felony within the purpose of this amendment. Merritt v. Jones, 259 Ark. 380, 533 S.W.2d 497 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, under this amendment, a felon who has discharged his or her sentence is able to vote, where it was unclear whether or not one voter had discharged her sentence at the time of the election, it was not error for the trial court to invalidate the votes of four absentee voters, including hers, because they were convicted felons. Womack v. Foster, 340 Ark. 124, 8 S.W.3d 854 (2000).

       The requirement of this section that it is the duty of the circuit clerk of each county upon conviction of any person of a felony to notify the registrar of the county of residence of such felon is not an absolute prerequisite to cancellation of a registration but is one method by which the registrar may obtain information concerning disqualification of a voter.

      <p>
       Acts 2017, No. 633, which amended Const. Amend. 51, §§ 6, 13 (adding subsection (b) of this section), met the requirements of Const. Amend. 51, § 19 and was a valid constitutional amendment. The appellate court could not say that Act 633's constitutional amendment was
       <i>
        clearly
       </i>
       not germane to Amendment 51 and not consistent with its policy and purposes; therefore, the preliminary injunction entered by the circuit court was reversed.
   Martin v. Haas, 2018 Ark. 283, 556 S.W.3d 509 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Verifying voter registration as set out in Acts 2017, No. 633 is germane to Ark. Const.

       The county judge, as an executive officer of the county, is vested exclusively with the responsibility for hiring county employees and with respect to salaries, wages, and other forms of compensation. McCuen v. Jackson, 265 Ark. 819, 581 S.W.2d 326 (1979); Horton v. Taylor, 585 F. Supp. 224 (W.D. Ark. 1984), rev'd on other grounds, 767 F.2d 471 (8th Cir. 1985).

      <p>
       When a county judge entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the union, the judge exercised his executive responsibility to provide county employees with other forms of compensation; therefore, the judge acted within his capacity to bind the county to the CBA and the county had an obligation to pay the insurance premiums for the county employees' dependents.

       County judges in Arkansas are given the executive power to make discretionary decisions regarding the operation of the system of county roads. Reding v. Wagner, 350 Ark. 322, 86 S.W.3d 386 (2002).
      </p>

       Where a county judge served as the principal executive officer of the county and his powers included operating the system of county roads and presiding over (but not voting in) the body that fixed the compensation of county officers, including the sheriff, but his position had no judicial duties and he had no authority, discretionary or otherwise, to order a person arrested, he could not directly participate in an unlawful arrest and, thus, was entitled to qualified immunity when he directed the county sheriff to arrest a truck driver after the driver's truck had caused a bridge to collapse under the truck's weight. Robinson v. White County, 452 F.3d 706 (8th Cir. 2006), aff'd in part, vac'd in part on reh'g, 459 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2006).

       Trial court properly awarded an injunction to a partnership in its action for the removal of a large flower box that homeowners placed on the eastern end of a road in a subdivision because nothing that the trial court did invaded the county judge's province; the trial court declared, as it had the authority to do, that the homeowners could not obstruct a public road and interfere with the partnership's access to its property.

      <p>
       Where a county judge refused to pay the salaries of certain court personnel when ordered to do so by a circuit judge, he was not subject to a contempt procedure since, under this section, the county judge was an administrative officer who simply executed the appropriations made by the quorum court; therefore, the county judge would have acted illegally if he had paid out funds that had not been appropriated for those salaries by the quorum court. Beaumont v. Adkisson, 267 Ark. 511, 593 S.W.2d 11 (1980).

       Where land for jail construction was to be purchased with existing funds and the construction costs were to be paid from a combination of existing funds and millage increases, an election was necessary before jail construction could begin, hence, the purchase of the land was merely the first step in the building of the new jail, not a separate, unrelated act; since the overall project of building a county jail necessitated a millage increase, it came squarely within the provisions of this section and an election was mandatory.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution states that no city or county shall ever issue interest-bearing evidences of indebtedness without the consent of the electors; the mandate is binding and it includes transparent evasions by which a token commission or other body is created to sign the bonds while disclaiming any responsibility on the part of its creator.

       The requirement of the former section that “each building” be listed separately on the ballot merely means that a courthouse cannot be combined with a jail or hospital or a jail with a hospital and a proposal for a county hospital to consist of two separate units in two separate towns may be voted upon as a single proposal.

       The Constitution states that no city or county shall ever issue interest-bearing evidences of indebtedness without the consent of the electors; the mandate is binding and it includes transparent evasions by which a token commission or other body is created to sign the bonds while disclaiming any responsibility on the part of its creator.

       The section of this amendment providing for the suspension of the collection of the annual tax levy when it is not required for the payment of bonds was intended to give the amendment flexibility and to take care of situations where sufficient funds might become available from other sources which could be applied on the payment of principal and interest.

       The former section provided for the payment of revenue bonds issued by a city to obtain money with which to purchase land and construct manufacturing facilities to lease to a company in an attempt to alleviate unemployment; the municipality or county may levy a special tax but does not say that a tax must be levied but is permissible. If the people of the state are willing to burden themselves with a tax, then it is reasonable to think they intended and are willing to pledge surplus revenues. Wayland v.

      <p>
       A city cannot use the surplus revenue derived from a tax levied to pay principal and interest on bonds for the construction of a city hall and fire house because the whole of the tax is pledged for that purpose and, since this is a maximum levy, the city must retire these bonds before another can be issued. City of West Memphis v. Jordan, 212 Ark. 739, 208 S.W.2d 164 (1948) (decision under prior Constitutional provision).

       Use of surplus funds for any purpose except to retire the bonds or to pay the interest thereon together with necessary expenses directly connected with such bond issue and proceedings thereof was contrary to this section. City of Stuttgart v. McCuing, 218 Ark. 34, 234 S.W.2d 209 (1950) (decision under prior Constitutional provision).
      </p>
      <p>
       An act violates this section insofar as applied to surplus funds collected in the form of tax assessments from property owners since neither the city nor the legislature has authority to divert such funds to another purpose without the consent of the property owners.

      <p>
       Surplus left in the bond account after the bonds issued by the industrial development commission created for the purpose of attracting industry to the area had been paid in full was properly ordered paid into the county general fund, rather than turned over to the commission, since the tax was levied for the purpose of paying bonds, not for the broad purpose of developing industry, and there was no evidence that the commission needed money. Morton v. Baker, 254 Ark. 444, 494 S.W.2d 122 (1973) (decision under prior Constitutional provision).

     City of Searcy, Arkansas, did not violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, this amendment, or Ark. Const., Art. 12, § 5 when it created a housing facilities board under the Arkansas Public Facilities Board Act (PFBA), § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.14.html#t14c137s14-137-101" target="_blank">14-137-101</a></cite> et seq., and issued bonds so a university that was associated with the Churches of Christ could fund building projects. The PFBA allowed the housing facilities board to issue bonds to finance projects that had a public purpose, education was a public purpose, and neither the city nor the board acted with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion.

    <p>
     Where user fees are pledged as repayment of revenue bonds, those fees need not be generated by the particular project being funded; user fees pledged to repay the bonds are revenues from the operation of any governmental unit. Harris v. City of Little Rock, 344 Ark. 95, 40 S.W.3d 214 (2001).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because this Amendment forbids repaying revenue bonds with assessments from local improvements or taxes, it correspondingly forbids pledging tax revenues to fill the gaps left by using other sources of monies to repay the bonds; in short, using tax revenues to offset losses caused by pledging revenues from user fees to cover bond indebtedness is indirectly using tax revenues to secure repayment of the bonds, which is prohibited conduct. Harris v. City of Little Rock, 344 Ark. 95, 40 S.W.3d 214 (2001).
    </p>
    <p>
     An ordinance complied with the repayment provisions of this Amendment where it reflected that the city “will pledge the fees from the park and recreational facilities owned or operated by the City more specifically defined hereinafter to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.” Harris v. City of Little Rock, 344 Ark. 95, 40 S.W.3d 214 (2001).

      Under the judicial power of the State, a Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission is established and shall be comprised of nine persons: three justices or judges, appointed by the Supreme Court; three licensed attorneys in good standing who are not justices or judges, one appointed by the Attorney General, one by the President of the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House; and three members appointed by the Governor. The members appointed by the Governor shall not be justices or judges, retired justices or judges, or attorneys. Alternate members shall be selected and vacancies filled in the same manner.

      The Commission may initiate, and shall receive and investigate, complaints concerning misconduct of all justices and judges, and requests and suggestions for leave or involuntary disability retirement. Any judge or justice may voluntarily request that the Commission recommend suspension because of pending disciplinary action or leave because of a mental or physical disability. Grounds for sanctions imposed by the Commission or recommendations made by the Commission shall be violations of the professional and ethical standards governing judicial officers, conviction of a felony, or physical or mental disability that prevents the proper performance of judicial duties. Grounds for suspension, leave, or removal from office shall be determined by legislative enactment.

      If, after notice and hearing, the Commission by majority vote of the membership determines that grounds exist for the discipline of a judge or justice, it may reprimand or censure the judge or justice, who may appeal to the Supreme Court. The Commission may, if it determines that grounds exist, after notice and hearing, and by majority vote of the membership, recommend to the Supreme Court that a judge or justice be suspended, with or without pay, or be removed, and the Supreme court, en banc, may take such action. Under this amendment, a judge who also has executive or legislative responsibilities shall be suspended or removed only from judicial duties. In any hearing involving a Supreme Court justice, all Supreme Court justices shall be disqualified from participation.

      If, after notice and hearing, the Commission by majority vote of the membership determines that a judge or justice is unable because of physical or mental disability to perform the duties of office, the Commission may recommend to the Supreme Court that the judge or justice be granted leave with pay or be retired, and the Supreme Court, en banc, may take such action. A judge or justice retired by the Supreme Court shall be considered to have retired voluntarily as provided by law.

     This amendment, effective December 8, 1988, was proposed by initiative petition and adopted at the 1988, general election by a vote of 398,107 for and 368,117 against.
    </p>
    <p>
     Enforcement of Amendment 68 is enjoined to the extent it prohibits the use of state funds to pay for abortions for Medicaid-eligible victims of rape or incest, for so long as federal law mandates Medicaid funding for abortions for Medicaid-eligible victims of rape or incest.

     District court concluded that the Arkansas Supreme Court would extend its decision in Aka v. Jefferson Hosp. Ass'n, 344 Ark. 627 (2001), which held that wrongful death suits could be brought on behalf of unborn, viable fetuses, to allow a negligence suit to be filed on a child's behalf, seeking to recover for alleged negligently-inflicted injuries that the child sustained in utero. The district court noted that the Arkansas Supreme Court had stated that Ark. Const. Amend. 68, § 2, continued to be a compelling expression of Arkansas'
   public policy to protect the lives of unborn children from the time of their conception until birth.

       It hardly seems possible that any other language could be used to explain more plainly or unambiguously the purpose or meaning of the phrase “to pay for any abortion”; very simply, in order for any entity to be in violation of this section, the following proof would have to be presented: (1) abortions were performed at the entity that were paid for with public funds; or (2) the entity paid for, with public funds, abortions that were performed elsewhere.

      In addition to the three amendments to the Constitution allowed pursuant to Article 19, § 22, either branch of the General Assembly at a regular session thereof may propose an amendment to the Constitution to change the salaries for the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Treasurer of State, Commissioner of State Lands, and Auditor of State and for members of the General Assembly. If the same be agreed to by a majority of all members elected to each house, such proposed amendment shall be entered on the journals with the yeas and nays, and published in at least one newspaper in each county, where a newspaper is published, for six months immediately preceding the next general election for Senators and Representatives, at which time the same shall be submitted to the electors of the State for approval or rejection. If a majority of the electors voting at such election adopt the amendment the same shall become a part of this Constitution. Only one amendment to the Constitution may be referred pursuant to this section.

     Preamble: The people of Arkansas find and declare that elected officials who remain in office too long become preoccupied with reelection and ignore their duties as representatives of the people. Entrenched incumbency has reduced voter participation and has led to an electoral system that is less free, less competitive, and less representative than the system established by the Founding Fathers. Therefore, the people of Arkansas, exercising their reserved powers, herein limit the terms of elected officials.

     The omission of the enacting clause was not fatal to this amendment because Ark. Const.

     A reading of Ark. Const. Amend. 73, §§ 1, 2, and 3, shows that they are grammatically independent and functionally independent; although what the people voted for in adopting this amendment was a theme or concept — the limitation of service terms for persons in public office — the fact that one category of persons is eliminated from that adopted amendment does not mean that the voters did not intend it to apply to the remaining two categories, and the striking of Ark. Const. Amend. 73, § 3, does not invalidate the rest of this amendment. United States Term Limits, Inc. v. Hill, 316 Ark. 251, 872 S.W.2d 349 (1994), aff'd, sub nom. United States Term Limits, Inc. v.

     The state has a rational basis for preserving the staggered term provisions which have been a part of our constitutions for more than 150 years; there is nothing in the record to suggest there was any intention on the part of the drafters of this amendment or of the voters in adopting it to discriminate against either the candidates or the electorate of any district. The fact that the amendment, when construed in connection with Ark. Const., Art. 8, as amended, will bring about modest and temporary differences in the total time a senator in a particular district may serve compared to senators of some other districts is simply incidental to the combination of constitutional provisions.

       The qualification clauses fix the sole requirements for congressional service, which is not a power left to the states under U.S. Const. Amend. 10; the attempt by this section to add an additional criterion based on length of service is in direct conflict with the qualification clauses, and, therefore, this section is stricken from this amendment. United States Term Limits, Inc. v. Hill, 316 Ark. 251, 872 S.W.2d 349 (1994), aff'd, sub nom. United States Term Limits, Inc. v.

       An additional qualification has been added to congressional eligibility by this section: the list now reads age, nationality, residency, and prior service. Term limitations for congressional representation may well have come of age, but to institute such a change, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution is required, ratified by three-fourths of the states. United States Term Limits, Inc. v. Hill, 316 Ark. 251, 872 S.W.2d 349 (1994), aff'd, sub nom. United States Term Limits, Inc. v.

     This amendment contained a preamble which read:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas career politicians dominating Congress have a conflict of interest that prevents them from enacting meaningful term limits and making Congress what the founders intended, the branch of government most responsive to the electorate; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas career politicians, while refusing to heed the desire of the people for meaningful term limits, amassed a nearly five trillion dollar national debt by not only voting year after year to spend far more than they have taken in, but also by voting to increase dramatically their own pay, and also providing lavish pensions from themselves and granting themselves numerous other privileges at the expense of the people; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas such irresponsible actions on the part of career politicians have mortgaged the future of not only every American citizen, but also their children and grandchildren; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas the abuse of power, the corruption, and the appearance of corruption brought about by political careerism is ultimately destructive to representative government by making Congress increasingly distant from the people; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas the President of the United States is limited to two terms in office by the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution, and governors in forty (40) states are limited by those states' laws to two terms or less; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas voters have established term limits for more than 2,000 state legislators, as well as more than 17,000 local officials across the nation, including state legislators and statewide elective officeholders in Arkansas; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas in 1992, the people of the State of Arkansas enacted, by an overwhelming majority, an amendment to the State Constitution limiting service in the United States House of Representatives to three terms and in the United States Senate to two terms, and which state-imposed Congressional Term Limits were ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas the United States Congress has ignored the desire of the people for meaningful term limits by refusing to submit to the states for ratification and amendment instituting Congressional Term Limits, and by proposing exceedingly long limits for its own members; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas it is the people themselves, not the United States Congress, who have in the past by majority vote, and should in the future set limits for the terms of Congressional offices; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas the people have a sovereign right and a compelling interest in the creation and preservation of a citizen Congress that will more effectively protect the freedom and prosperity of the people, which interest and right may not be as effectively served in any way other than that proposed by this amendment to the Arkansas State Constitution; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas with foresight and wisdom our founders, under Article V of the United States Constitution, did provide the people with a procedure by which to overcome Congressional self-interest, by which procedure the people of the several states may call a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution when two-thirds or thirty-four (34) states expressly call for a convention; and

     “Whereas amendments proposed by such a convention would become a part of the United States Constitution upon the ratification of three-fourths of the states (38); and

       This Amendment is nothing more than a coercive attempt to compel the Arkansas General Assembly to do as the alleged majority of the people wish, without any intellectual debate, deliberation, or consideration of whether such action is in the best interest of all the people of this state. Donovan v. Priest, 326 Ark. 353, 931 S.W.2d 119 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1149</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1081</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 216 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The intent is clear from the language of this Amendment that the legislators are hereby instructed to do as told and, although this Amendment does not compel such action by the legislature on threat of loss of salary, it is nonetheless binding on the legislators in an extortive manner as failure to heed the amendment's instructions will result in their threatened potential political deaths; the Amendment would virtually tie the hands of the individual members of the General Assembly such that they would no longer be part of a deliberative body acting independently in exercising their individual best judgments on every issue, and, consequently, the measure is an impermissible use of the initiative power reserved to the people of this state in Ark. Const. Amend. 7. Donovan v. Priest, 326 Ark. 353, 931 S.W.2d 119 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1149</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1081</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 216 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The proposed duties to be given to the Secretary of State are not merely ministerial, rather, they amount to substantive penalties that are equivalent to an officially sanctioned recommendation by the State of Arkansas not to vote for such candidates because they disregarded the instructions and wishes of the voters; if the proposed measure were merely a nonbinding attempt to communicate the desire of the people for term limits, then their remedy is to voice their desires at the polls by voting for candidates who share these beliefs. Donovan v. Priest, 326 Ark. 353, 931 S.W.2d 119 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1149</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1081</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L.

      <p>
       This amendment is clearly violative of the provision in U.S. Const., Art. V, that all proposals of amendments to that Constitution must come either from Congress or state legislatures, not from the people; it is an indirect attempt to propose an amendment to the United States Constitution and, as such, violates the narrow, specific grants of authority provided in U.S. Const., Art. V. Donovan v. Priest, 326 Ark. 353, 931 S.W.2d 119 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1149</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1081</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L.

     In a city's challenge to the county assessor's allocation of millage rates, Ark. Const. Amend. 78 did not repeal the uniform rate of 25 mills to be used for maintenance and operation of the schools as provided under Ark. Const. Amend. 74 as the voters were never put on notice that redevelopment projects would be funded with a portion of the uniform rate of 25 mills that had previously been designated solely for the maintenance and operation of the public school. Furthermore, an invincible repugnancy between the amendments did not exist so as to cause a repeal by implication.

      </b>
      For the purpose of acquiring, constructing, installing or renting real property or tangible personal property having an expected useful life of more than one (1) year, municipalities and counties may incur short-term financing obligations maturing over a period of, or having a term, not to exceed five (5) years. Such obligations may bear interest at either:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      a fixed rate throughout the term thereof, including a fixed interest rate which is to be determined by reference to an index or other formula, but not to exceed the maximum lawful rate of interest for fixed rate obligations, or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      a rate which may vary at such times and under such circumstances as the parties may agree, whether or not the interest rate in fact varies, but not to exceed the maximum lawful rate of interest for variable rate obligations. The maximum lawful rate of interest for fixed rate obligations is the formula rate in effect on the date the obligation is incurred, regardless of when such interest is to begin to accrue. The maximum lawful rate of interest for variable rate obligations is the formula rate in effect on the date such interest accrues. The aggregate principal amount of short-term financing obligations incurred by a municipality or a county pursuant to this section shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the assessed value of taxable property located within the municipality or two and one half percent (2.5%) of the assessed value of taxable property located within the county, as determined by the last tax assessment completed before the last obligation was incurred by the city or county. The total annual principal and interest payments in each fiscal year on all outstanding obligations of a municipality or a county pursuant to this section shall be charged against and paid from the general revenues for such fiscal year, which may include road fund revenues.

      ‘Short-term financing obligation’ means a debt, a note, an installment purchase agreement, a lease, a lease-purchase contract, or any other similar agreement, whether secured or unsecured; provided, that the obligation shall mature over a period of, or have a term, not to exceed five (5) years;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      ‘Formula rate’ means that rate of interest which is five percentage points (5%) above the equivalent bond yield of one year United States Treasury Bills offered by the United States Treasury at the last auction during the immediately preceding calendar quarter, calculated by rounding up to the nearest one-fourth of one percentage point (0.25%) (unless the equivalent bond yield is already by a multiple of one-fourth of one percentage point), and announced by the State Bank Commissioner (or such successor official who may be performing substantially the same duties) from information available from the Federal Reserve System of the United States. The calculation of the formula rate shall be made on or before the tenth (10th) day of each calendar quarter. The formula rate so calculated shall be effective on the eleventh (11th) day of the calendar quarter and shall continue in effect until the formula rate for the succeeding calendar quarter shall have been calculated and becomes effective. If, for any reason, the United States ceases to issue one year Treasury Bills, such calculation shall be made using a debt instrument of the United States having substantially the same general character and maturity. The calculation and announcement of the formula rate by the State Bank Commissioner shall be final.

       Tax assessor did not err in disregarding a freeze and assessing a taxpayer's property at a higher amount based on a change in “location factor” because pursuant to § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c34s26-34-101" target="_blank">26-34-101</a></cite>, changes in assessment were valued as of the first Monday in January of the year in which the changes are made, so the assessment value that the taxpayer was notified of in July 2005 was effective as of January 3, 2005, prior to his sixty-fifth birthday.

       Circuit court did not err in finding that improvements made to a taxpayer's property prior to his sixty-fifth birthday were “substantial improvements” within the meaning of section 1 of this amendment because the definition of “substantial improvements” under Assessment Coordination Department Rules, 177-01-001 Ark. Code R. 4.08.1, included renovation, reconstruction, and refurbishment such as that done by the taxpayer; whether improvements constituted a twenty-five percent increase in value is not definitive of whether the improvements were substantial.

     Court granted plaintiff's motion challenging the Arkansas Civil Justice Reform Act of 2003, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c55s16-55-212ol1b" target="_blank">16-55-212(b)</a></cite>, and allowed plaintiff to introduce evidence of the amounts billed to her for medical services necessitated by the injuries that were the subject of her lawsuit, regardless of any discount that she had received on those amounts because (1) if the Arkansas Supreme Court were considering the constitutionality of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c55s16-55-212ol1b" target="_blank">16-55-212(b)</a></cite>, it would hold that § 16-55-212(b) infringed on its constitutional prerogative to prescribe rules of evidence under Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 3, and was, therefore, unconstitutional because § 16-55-212(b) would, if enforced, work a reversal of the collateral source rule that had been recognized and approved by the Arkansas Supreme Court, yet the Arkansas Supreme Court did not “prescribe” § 16-55-212(b), and (2) the Arkansas Supreme Court would, if presented with the instant motion, find that § 16-55-212(b) violated Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 32 as the Arkansas Supreme Court had held that a personal injury plaintiff was entitled, assuming a successful showing of liability, to recover the payments made (or written off) on her behalf by a collateral source, but § 16-55-212(b) would prevent her from doing that.

Const., Art. 2, §§ 8 and 21, was rejected because the federal judicial power clause had never before been construed to limit courts in the manner in which they conduct their business, and the same could be said for Arkansas's judicial article.

     Since this amendment states that circuit courts assume the jurisdiction of chancery courts, circuit courts have only the jurisdiction that chancery courts had prior to the amendment; thus, the trial court erred when it found that it had the jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to prevent the Arkansas Professional Bailbondsman Licensing Board from holding a hearing on bail bond company's alleged violations due to insufficient notice.

     After petitioner special prosecutors of Division 3 filed a report regarding their investigation into possible criminal conduct involving the death of a civilian by a police officer, Division 6 did not have authority to call a special grand jury to investigate the incident as Division 3 had exclusive jurisdiction because it had already acted by appointing special prosecutors to investigate before Division 6 issued its order to call a special grand jury. Under its superintending control, the supreme court could not allow coordinate divisions of a single circuit to compete for control of processes investigating possible criminal acts; Division 3 assumed jurisdiction first and thus held exclusive jurisdiction.

     In a wrongful death action filed by the decedent's son against the hospital and doctors, summary judgment in favor of the doctors and hospital was improper as the circuit court usurped the authority of the probate court under this amendment by its ruling that the son's appointment as personal representative of his father's estate was void.

     This amendment, which was in effect when the circuit court ruled on the matters at issue, merged circuit and chancery courts into circuit courts so that circuit courts would have jurisdiction over all matters previously cognizable in circuit, chancery, probate, and juvenile courts; the circuit judge was empowered to hear all matters within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, which included probate matters.

     Writ of prohibition was not available where the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction, even though it was alleged that the plaintiffs in the underlying action lacked standing, because the issue of standing was not a question of subject matter jurisdiction, and § 6(A) of this amendment did not alter the jurisdiction of law and equity.

       Prior case law did not preclude the Supreme Court of Arkansas from considering a second petition for habeas corpus relief where defendant's first petition, alleging that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment of conviction against defendant for rape because the crime had occurred in another county, had been rejected because defendant had not provided an adequate abstract of the proceedings in the trial court; the Court's prior opinion in McAdams v. Automotive Rentals, Inc., 324 Ark. 332, 924 S.W.2d. 464 (1966), was overruled to the extent that it was in conflict with the present decision. Cloird v. State, 352 Ark. 190, 99 S.W.3d 419 (2003).

       Arkansas Supreme Court Rules determine the Court of Appeals'
   jurisdiction and caseload, whereas the Arkansas Constitution establishes the Supreme Court's jurisdiction and authority to establish rules governing which cases it will review; for federal habeas purposes, the Arkansas Supreme Court (not the Court of Appeals) is the “court of last resort” in Arkansas.

       Order denying adoption petitions, treating the matter as a custody issue, and awarding custody of a child to appellees was upheld as the trial court had the power to determine custody after it dismissed the adoption petitions; the issue of custody was before the trial court because appellees had requested custody of the child, as well as the right to adopt her.

      <p>
       In a case in which two insurance companies sought a writ of prohibition ordering a circuit court to dismiss the claims alleged against them in a proposed nationwide class action against numerous insurance companies, they unsuccessfully argued that subdivision (A) of this section of this amendment granted circuit courts jurisdiction over only justiciable matters, and that following the removal of plaintiff insured's claims to bankruptcy court and the dismissal of those claims due to his death, there remained no plaintiffs who had an insurance contract with them who could assert a justiciable matter against it in the circuit court. Standing was not a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, and this amendment did not change that.

      </p>
      <p>
       Writ of prohibition was not available where the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction, even though it was alleged that the plaintiffs in the underlying action lacked standing, because the issue of standing was not a question of subject matter jurisdiction, and § 6(A) of this amendment did not alter the jurisdiction of law and equity.

      <p>
       As the criminal division of the circuit court lost its exclusive jurisdiction over a juvenile's case when it transferred the case to the juvenile division pursuant to § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.09.html#t09c27s9-27-318" target="_blank">9-27-318</a></cite>, the criminal division lacked authority to later set aside its transfer order, and that order was a nullity.
   C.H. v. State, 2010 Ark. 279, 365 S.W.3d 879 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court had jurisdiction to hear the case even though it concerned child-custody law and was outside the subject of proceedings in the juvenile division, because the designation of divisions was for the purpose of judicial administration and not for the purpose of subject matter jurisdiction, and the creation of divisions would in no way limit the powers and duties of the judges to hear all matters within the jurisdiction of the circuit court; once the juvenile division of the circuit court ordered that the child be placed in the permanent custody of the third parties, the child was no longer dependent-neglected and she came into dependency-neglect proceedings due to parental neglect and parental unfitness.

       In a termination of parental rights case, a circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case because it had original jurisdiction of all justiciable matters not otherwise assigned; the creation of divisions did not limit the power to hear the case.
   Russell v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 2014 Ark. App. 734 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the circuit court might have erred in allowing a prior, closed dependency-neglect case to be reopened, it had subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the petition and enter the termination order, the parents failed to raise any argument to the circuit court concerning the reopening of the closed dependency-neglect case, and any error in that regard on the part of the circuit court was waived and not preserved for appeal.
   Ward v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 2015 Ark. App. 106 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly dismissed an individual's complaint for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and mandamus against the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission, stemming from the Commission's decision not to file formal charges against a judge, because the circuit court properly concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Review of the Commission's decisions lies exclusively with the Supreme Court of Arkansas. Since the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, appellate jurisdiction was lacking.

      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court, juvenile division, had subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the guardianship proceeding, which arose out of dependency-neglect proceedings. While the circuit court might have erred in retaining jurisdiction in the absence of a formal request, a failure to follow statutory procedure does not oust the subject-matter jurisdiction of the court. Section 9-27-306(a)(1)(B)(i) contemplates that the circuit court's juvenile division may exercise jurisdiction over a juvenile up to 21 years of age; because the mother did not object to the irregularity in the proceedings below, her argument was not preserved.

      <p>
       In creditor's action to set aside an alleged fraudulent conveyance arising from a transfer-on-death (TOD) beneficiary designation, the circuit court erroneously ruled that the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction and that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction; under Ark. Const.

       The right to a jury trial set out in Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 7 is unaffected by Ark. Const. Amend. 80 as section 7 does not assure the right to a jury trial in all possible instances, but rather in those cases where the right to a jury trial existed when the constitution was framed; further, the right to a jury trial does not apply to new rights created by the legislature since the adoption of the Arkansas Constitution.

       Although the right to a jury trial does not extend to foreclosure claims, the claims in the borrower’s counterclaim and third-party complaint were legal in na- ture, and thus the circuit court erred in finding that the borrower did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial on those claims.

       In litigation involving the administration of several family trusts, the chief justice did not lack jurisdiction to appoint a special judge under the circumstances presented, even though all the judges in the judicial circuit had not recused. Plaintiff's focus on Admin. Order No. 16, § III, ignored the broad language of Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 13, and Admin. Order No. 16, § II, which provide the chief justice with the authority to assign a special judge if the chief justice determines there is “other need” for a special judge.

      Ark. Const. Amend. 94, which amended this section effective November 5, 2014, was proposed by H.J.R. 1009 during the 2013 Regular Session and adopted at the November 2014 general election by a vote of 428,206 for and 388,459 against.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before amendment, subsection (E) read: “The General Assembly shall by law determine the amount and method of payment of Justices and Judges. Such salaries and expenses may be increased, but not diminished, during the term for which such Justices or Judges are selected or elected. Salaries of Circuit Judges shall be uniform throughout the state.”

   <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c13s16-13-104" target="_blank">16-13-104</a></cite> [repealed] was unconstitutional, as it conflicted with Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 16, which governs judicial qualifications; thus, a circuit court judge cannot run for election for another judicial position. Daniels v. Dennis, 365 Ark. 338, 229 S.W.3d 880 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly denied a voter's disqualification petition and granted a judicial candidate's third-party complaint because she was an eligible candidate under the Arkansas Constitution where the alleged administrative suspension of her as a delinquent lawyer was done without notice or a hearing in violation of her state and federal due process rights.
   Williams v. Martin, 2014 Ark. 210 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Candidate's appeal from an order granting a declaratory judgment and issuing a writ of mandamus in favor of a circuit judge on the basis that the candidate was not qualified or eligible for the office of circuit judge was moot because the supreme court could provide no relief; the circuit judge initiated a proper pre-election challenge to the candidate's qualification to stand for the office.
   Bailey v. Martin, 2014 Ark. 213, 433 S.W.3d 904 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial candidate was a licensed attorney for six years before the date of taking office, as subsection (B) of this section required, because, inter alia, Ark. Bar. Admis. R. VII(E), requiring the Clerk to keep a list of attorneys no longer licensed and the reasons therefor, including delinquency of fee, did not show the candidate was no longer licensed because (1) the candidate's privilege to practice law was not terminated, and (2) the more specific Ark. Bar. Admis. R. VII(C) governed.
   Kelly v. Martin, 2014 Ark. 217, 433 S.W.3d 896 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial candidate was a licensed attorney for six years before the date of taking office, as subsection (B) of this section required, because, inter alia, the candidate's nonpayment of an annual license fee for 45 days, automatically suspending the candidate under Ark. Bar. Admis. R. VII, did not terminate the candidate's license or remove the candidate from the list of licensed attorneys.
   Kelly v. Martin, 2014 Ark. 217, 433 S.W.3d 896 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial candidate's occasional failure to pay an annual attorney licensing fee, causing automatic suspension under Ark. Bar. Admis. R. VII(C), did not make the candidate ineligible for office due to not being licensed to practice law for the six years preceding taking office, because the candidate remained licensed when suspended, since the candidate's license was not terminated and the candidate's name was not removed from the list of licensed attorneys.
   Chandler v. Martin, 2014 Ark. 219, 433 S.W.3d 884 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court Justice, having been duly elected by the people of Arkansas and having begun her eight-year term as a justice on the Arkansas Supreme Court on January 1, 2015, was the qualified justice invested with the judicial power to participate in Case No. CV-14-427; a Special Justice's constitutional authority to participate in Case No. CV-14-427 expired December 31, 2014.
   Smith v. Wright, 2015 Ark. 189, 461 S.W.3d 687 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Distinction between “residence” and “domicile” is not contemplated by Ark. Const. Amend. 80; it simply requires that justices and judges be qualified electors within the geographical area from which they are chosen.
   Barrett v. Thurston, 2020 Ark. 36, 593 S.W.3d 1 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not clearly err in determining that an appointed district court judge was a qualified elector of a specific district, thereby qualifying her as a candidate for a position on the Court of Appeals; Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 16(D) simply requires that justices and judges be qualified electors within the geographical area from which they are chosen, and the appointed judge had established her physical presence in the district by purchasing a home, registering to vote, and assessing personal property there (even though she still owned another home outside the district).

       Eligibility for benefits demonstrably is not the equivalent of a qualification for holding judicial office, and §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.24.html#t24c08s24-8-215" target="_blank">24-8-215</a></cite> and <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.24.html#t24c08s24-8-710" target="_blank">24-8-710</a></cite> do not constitute an additional qualification in contravention of the constitution; accordingly, the statutes do not violate the constitution.
   Landers v. Stone, 2016 Ark. 272, 496 S.W.3d 370 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 24-8-215 and 24-8-710 impose neither a direct nor an indirect qualification for holding judicial office and do not prohibit any judge from holding office past age 70; if elected past age 70, no judge is subject to being ousted from his or her position as a result of the statutes, but instead, the laws pertain only to a judge's eligibility to receive retirement benefits, which are, after all, a matter of grace bestowed by the General Assembly.

       Circuit court erred to the extent that it based its decision to grant the dismissal on the failure of the claimant to prove specifically how each challenged voter voted, because without question, the claimant should not have been required to present tracing evidence of how each challenged voter voted when he was foreclosed from doing so by this amendment. While this amendment protected the secrecy of ballots, its intent was to protect an honest voter, not an illegal one, and in election contests in which there was evidence of an illegal ballot, the person who illegally voted could be forced to testify as to whom they voted and such was permissible under this amendment.

     Acts 2019, No. 694, § 8: Apr. 4, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that under current law the Arkansas Code Revision Commission does not have the authority to correct conflicts occurring when multiple acts amend the same provision of the Arkansas Constitution as expressly permitted by the Arkansas Constitution; that this inability to resolve conflicts makes the law unclear and impossible to publish for review and study by the citizens of the state; and that this act should become effective at the earliest opportunity so that it may be applied to acts enacted by the Ninety-Second General Assembly. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

     Ballot title for a proposed constitutional amendment, now codified as this amendment, complied with Ark. Const., Art. 19, § 22 in that it identified and distinguished the amendment and was not worded in some way as to constitute a manifest fraud upon the public.

     This amendment, which concerned public and private debt obligation, did not violate the separate-issue requirement under Ark. Const., Art. 19, § 22 because each relevant section related to the general subject of the amendment and was reasonably germane to the other sections.

    (A)

     Acts 2017, No. 1023, §§ 2 and 3, imposed additional requirements on both the Department of Health and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Department of Finance and Administration regarding labeling and testing of usable marijuana to ensure that food or drink that has been combined with usable marijuana does not exceed ten milligrams (10 mg) of active tetrahydrocannabinol per portion.

    <p>
     Acts 2017, No. 4, §
   9: Jan. 23, 2017. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the dates set for rulemaking within the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment of 2016 are impractical to encompass the magnitude of the medical marijuana program; that the Department of Health, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Department of Finance and Administration, and the Medical Marijuana Commission need additional time to properly establish a medical marijuana program to fulfill the policies and purposes of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment of 2016; and that this act is immediately necessary because the citizens of Arkansas need certainty about the law and rules creating the medical marijuana program before fully investing time, funds, personnel, and other resources into the development of dispensaries and cultivation facilities and because public participation in and transparency of the rulemaking process must be ensured. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the Medical Marijuana Commission will begin accepting applications for the licensing of cultivation facilities and dispensaries on July 1, 2017, which will begin the implementation of the use of medical marijuana in the state; that additional funding is needed to ensure that the implementation of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment of 2016 is revenue neutral; and that this act is necessary because it is in the best interests of the state to increase Arkansas's ability to impose a special privilege tax on cultivation facilities and dispensaries to relieve the burden on the state of implementing the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment of 2016. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2017.”

     Acts 2017, No. 1099, §
   2: Apr. 7, 2017. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that public schools need additional guidance and clarity concerning the effect of Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 98, also known as the ‘Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment of 2016’; that the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment of 2016 became effective on and after November 9, 2016; and that this act is immediately necessary because the public schools of the State of Arkansas need certainty about the law and rules concerning the use of medical marijuana by public school students. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

   as the majority of the thirteen (13) acts. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 31, 2017.”

    <p>
     Acts 2019, No. 694, § 8: Apr. 4, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that under current law the Arkansas Code Revision Commission does not have the authority to correct conflicts occurring when multiple acts amend the same provision of the Arkansas Constitution as expressly permitted by the Arkansas Constitution; that this inability to resolve conflicts makes the law unclear and impossible to publish for review and study by the citizens of the state; and that this act should become effective at the earliest opportunity so that it may be applied to acts enacted by the Ninety-Second General Assembly. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

       Circuit court had no subject-matter jurisdiction to review the licensing decision of the Medical Marijuana Commission (MMC) concerning cultivation facilities because (1) under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.25.html#t25c15s25-15-212" target="_blank">25-15-212</a></cite>, no “adjudication” as defined by statute occurred at the agency level and the MMC's decision was not quasi-judicial, and (2) under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.25.html#t25c15s25-15-207" target="_blank">25-15-207</a></cite>, the court only had jurisdiction to resolve a rule's validity or applicability, but the invalidity of a MMC rule was not pled, the “applicability” of a rule was not contested, and no declaration of whether a rule should have been applied was sought; instead, the complaints sought a declaration that the “application” of the MMC rules was improper, unfair, and arbitrary.

      <p>
       Supreme Court of Akansas did not address whether Rule 19 of the Medical Marijuana Commission conveyed subject-matter jurisdiction to the circuit court; although that rule provided that a denial of a cultivation license may be appealed to the circuit court, the issue was not ripe because the appellees had not been issued denial letters subsequent to an adjudication.
