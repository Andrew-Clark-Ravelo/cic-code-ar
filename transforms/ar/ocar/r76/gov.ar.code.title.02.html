      <b>
       (a)(1)
      </b>
      The bylaws or the marketing or participation contract of any association existing under this subchapter may fix specific sums as liquidated damages to be paid by the member or stockholder to the association upon the breach or threatened breach by him or her of any provision of the participation agreement or upon the breach or threatened breach by him or her of any provision of the marketing contract regarding the sale or delivery or withholding of products.

      <b>
       (b)(1)
      </b>
      In the event of any breach or threatened breach of the marketing contract by a member or other person, the association shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent the breach or further breach of the contract and to a decree of specific performance of the contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)(A)
      </b>

      <b>
       (c)

      In any civil action, upon any marketing contract of any member with any association existing under this subchapter, it shall be conclusively presumed that the products produced by any person, firm, or corporation during the period of time covered by the marketing contract, on the land of the member, however and by whomsoever produced, are the products of the member. As such, the products of the member are subject to the marketing contract if the products have been grown or acquired under any contract between the member and the other person, firm, or corporation entered into after the execution of the marketing contract. In such actions, the remedies for nondelivery or breach shall lie and be enforceable against the persons, firms, or corporations.

     <p>
      It is the declared policy of the state to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural and forest lands and other facilities for the production of food, fiber, and other agricultural and silvicultural products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural areas, agricultural operations often become the subject of nuisance suits. As a result, agricultural operations are sometimes forced to cease operations. Many are discouraged from making investments in farm or other agricultural improvements. It is the purpose of this chapter to reduce the loss to the state of its agricultural resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to be a nuisance.

       (1)
      </b>
      The processor may deliver to the producer or his or her authorized representative and any secured parties the full amount of the purchase price on the same day the catfish product is purchased and possession is transferred;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)(A)
      </b>
      Before the close of the fourteenth calendar day following the purchase of the catfish products and transfer or possession of the catfish products, the processor may deliver to the producer or his or her authorized representative and any secured parties the full amount of the purchase price.

      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      If the producer or his or her authorized representative or secured parties are not present to receive payment at the point of transfer or possession, as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section, the processor shall wire transfer funds or place a check in the United States mail for the full amount of the purchase price, properly addressed to the producer and any secured parties, within the time limits specified in this subsection. This action shall be deemed in compliance with the requirement for prompt payment under this subdivision (a)(2); or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      The parties to the purchase and sale of catfish products may expressly agree in writing before the purchase or sale to effect payment in a manner other than that required in subdivision (a)(1) or (2) of this section if the manner of payment does not interfere with the rights of secured parties. Any agreement shall be disclosed in the records of any producer selling the catfish and in the processors' records and on the accounts or other documents issued by the processors relating to the transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)(1)

      Regardless of the method elected under subdivision (a)(2) of this section to purchase catfish products, a Class A registrant, before the transaction, shall be required to:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      Be bonded in the amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) or in an amount which may be determined by the State Plant Board;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)

      Provide cash security, letters of credit, and such other evidences of security as shall be authorized by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)

      However, if a Class A registrant purchases catfish solely and exclusively from producers that are also the owners of the processor, then the Class A registrant is exempt from the bonding or security requirements imposed under subdivision (b)(1) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      Any delay or attempt to delay, by a processor purchasing catfish products, the collection of funds as provided in this chapter or otherwise for the purpose of or resulting in extending the normal period of payment for the catfish shall be considered an unfair practice in violation of this chapter.

     <p>
      <b>
       (d)(1)
      </b>
      At the time catfish are delivered to a processor and unloaded from a live-haul truck, the processor shall weigh the catfish using a device that is of a type suitable for the weighing of catfish.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)

      Deductions for trash fish, turtles, and other foreign material except water shall be determined by a separate weighing of the same.

      Processors are responsible for draining water from weighing baskets.

       (e)(1)
      </b>
      Scales used to weigh catfish and foreign material under this section must be capable of electronically printing a ticket that provides an exact duplicate of the weight indicated.

      </b>
      Any additional information as the board deems necessary for the lawful and accurate recording of the weight of the catfish.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (f)
      </b>
      Processors who process less than seventeen thousand five hundred pounds (17,500 lbs.) of catfish per week are not required to use the electronic printing scales otherwise required by this section.
      <b>
       (g)
      </b>
      The board shall be responsible for the enforcement of this section, and its agents shall perform periodic inspections of processing plants to ensure that the provisions of this section are being carried out and that all deductions for foreign material are legitimate and fair to the producer.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer [sic], it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 317, § 8: Mar. 3, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 10 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1995 abolished the Joint Interim Committee on Agriculture and Economic Development and in its place established separate House and Senate Committees; that various sections of the Arkansas Code refer to the Joint Interim Committee on Agriculture and Economic Development and should be corrected to refer to the House and Senate Interim Committees; that this act so provides; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to make the laws compatible as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act includes technical corrects to Act 923 of 2003 which establishes the classification and compensation levels of state employees covered by the provisions of the Uniform Classification and Compensation Act; that Act 923 of 2003 will become effective on July 1, 2003; and that to avoid confusion this act must also [become] effective on July 1, 2003. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2003.”

      Acts 2019, No. 423, § 2: Mar. 11, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that delay in implementation of this act would hinder the State Plant Board from enforcing egregious violations during the 2019 growing season, which could have a detrimental impact on the state's agricultural economy. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

       (a)
      </b>
      The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate in the public interest the labeling, distribution, storage, transportation, and disposal of pesticides as defined in this subchapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Pesticides are valuable to our state's agricultural production and to the protection of man and the environment from insects, rodents, weeds, and other forms of life which may be pests; but it is essential to the public health and welfare that they be regulated to prevent adverse effects on human life and the environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      New pesticides are continually being discovered, synthesized, or developed which are valuable for the control of pests and for use as defoliants, desiccants, plant regulators, spray adjuvants, and related purposes. However, such pesticides may be ineffective, may cause injury to man, or may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for regulation of pesticides.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)(1)
      </b>
      A cotton grower who fails to pay when due and upon reasonable notice any assessment levied under this subchapter shall be subject to a per-acre penalty as established in the State Plant Board's rules in addition to the assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      A cotton grower who fails to pay all assessments, including penalties, within thirty (30) days' notice of penalty shall destroy any cotton plants growing on his or her acreage which is subject to the assessment. Any such cotton plants which are not destroyed shall be deemed to be a public nuisance, and the public nuisance may be abated in the same manner as any public nuisance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      The board may petition the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the public nuisance is located to have the nuisance condemned and destroyed, with all costs of destroying to be levied against the grower. This injunctive relief shall be available to the board notwithstanding the existence of any other legal remedy, and the board shall not be required to file a bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)(1)
      </b>
      In addition to any other remedies for the collection of assessments, including penalties, the board may secure a lien upon cotton subject to the assessments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)(A)
      </b>
      If the cotton was grown on a cost-share basis, the lien may be perfected on the landowner's share and the grower's share of the cotton.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      Any buyer of cotton shall take free of the lien if he or she has not received written notice of the lien from the board or if he or she has paid for the cotton by a check in which the board is named as joint payee.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      The amount of the lien on the cotton shall reflect the landowner's and grower's proportionate share of the assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)(1)(A)
      </b>
      No gins in the State of Arkansas shall gin any cotton for any cotton grower from Arkansas or from any other state unless and until that grower files with the respective gin a certificate of compliance issued by the board certifying that the grower has paid all fees, assessments, penalties, and costs imposed and required under this subchapter, unless a grower has been granted an extension by the board in compliance with subsection (e) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      It is the responsibility of each grower to procure a certificate of compliance or proof that an exemption for compliance has been granted from the board by September 1 of each successive crop year and to file same with a gin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)(A)
      </b>
      Any gin that gins cotton for any cotton grower who has not filed a current valid certificate of compliance issued by the board shall be assessed a penalty to be established by board rules.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      Any cotton grower will be subject to having a lien placed on the following year's crop for any unpaid assessments or penalties incurred in the previous year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)(1)
      </b>
      The board shall by rule establish a procedure in which a cotton grower can apply for exemption from payment of any assessment or penalty imposed in this section, on the basis that the payment of the assessment or the penalty will impose undue financial hardship on the grower, and shall prescribe the criteria to be used in determining undue financial hardship.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)(A)
      </b>
      Any cotton grower who wishes to request an exemption from payment of the assessment, or the penalty, or both, shall apply for the exemption on forms prescribed by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      A separate application must be filed for each calendar year for which the cotton grower seeks an exemption, and each such application shall contain information on which the grower relies to justify an exemption on the basis of undue financial hardship.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      The application form shall include an oath or affirmation of the applicant as to the truth of all information contained in or accompanying the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (3)(A)
   
   The board shall forward each completed exemption application form and any information accompanying the form to the cotton growers' organization certified under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t02c16s2-16-612" target="_self">2-16-612</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      The certified cotton growers' organization shall determine whether each applicant qualifies for a hardship exemption based on the information contained in or accompanying the application form.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      If the certified organization determines that the payment of the assessment or the penalty, or both, would impose undue financial hardship on a cotton grower who has applied for an exemption, the organization may:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      Exempt the cotton grower from payment of the assessment or the penalty, or both; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      Permit the cotton grower to pay the assessment or penalty, or both, on an installment payment plan and prescribe the payment schedule.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      Upon making a determination on any application for exemption, the certified organization shall notify the board of its determination, which shall be binding on the applicant.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      Upon receipt of notice of a determination by the organization, the board shall promptly notify the affected cotton grower of the determination.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (7)
      </b>
      If an exemption is denied, the assessment and penalties for the year in which the application is made will be due at the time they would otherwise have been due if the application had not been filed or within thirty (30) days after the date the notice of the adverse determination is received by the cotton grower, whichever is later.

       2-16-901. Pest Control Compact.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Pest Control Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IFindings
     </p>
     <p>
      The party states find that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this Compact, the annual loss of approximately 137 billion dollars from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Because of the varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another, to complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crops and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an Insurance Fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interest, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.

       (a)
      </b>
      Each party state pledges to each other party state that it will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the strictest practicable limits, any and all pests. It is recognized that performance of this responsibility involves:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      The maintenance of pest control and eradication activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level that would be reasonable for its own protection in the absence of this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been done in the absence of this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present within its borders but present within another party state, or whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may request the Governing Board to authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent, or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or reinfestation of the requesting state. Upon such authorization the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use moneys available from the Insurance Fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      In order to apply for expenditures from the Insurance Fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      A detailed statement of the circumstances which occasion the request for the invoking of the Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      Evidence that the pest on account of whose eradication or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass, or other plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      A statement of the extent of the present and projected program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefore, in connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of introduction of the pest concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       4.
      </b>
      Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3 constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       5.
      </b>
      A declaration as to whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the invoking of the Compact in the particular instance can be abated by a program undertaken with the aid of moneys from the Insurance Fund in one year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time.

      Upon the submission as required by paragraph (c) of this Article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes of this Compact and justified thereby, the Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize support of the program. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and all determinations of the Governing Board or Executive Committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefore shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.

      Article VIIAdvisory and Technical Committees
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board may establish advisory and technical committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its functions. Any such advisory or technical committee, or any member or members thereof may meet with and participate in its deliberations upon request of the Governing Board or Executive Committee. An advisory or technical committee may furnish information and recommendations with respect to any application for assistance from the Insurance Fund being considered by such Board or Committee and the Board or Committee may receive and consider the same: provided that any participant in a meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of the Compact shall be entitled to know the substance of any such information and recommendations, at the time of the meeting if made prior thereto or as a part thereof or, if made thereafter, no later than the time at which the Governing Board or Executive Committee makes its disposition of the application.

The request for appropriations shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-tenth of the total budget in equal shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products, produced in each party state. In determining the value of such crops and products the Insurance Fund may employ such source or sources of information as in its judgment present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the budgets and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of products.

At any time when the Claims Account has reached its maximum limit or would reach its maximum limit by the addition of moneys requested for appropriation by the party states, the Governing Board shall reduce its budget requests on a pro rata basis in such manner as to keep the Claims Account within such maximum limit. Any moneys in the Claims Account by virtue of conditional donations, grants, or gifts shall be included in calculations made pursuant to this paragraph only to the extent that such moneys are available to meet demands arising out of the claims.

     Acts 1997, No. 317, § 8: Mar. 3, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 10 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1995 abolished the Joint Interim Committee on Agriculture and Economic Development and in its place established separate House and Senate Committees; that various sections of the Arkansas Code refer to the Joint Interim Committee on Agriculture and Economic Development and should be corrected to refer to the House and Senate Interim Committees; that this act so provides; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to make the laws compatible as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

      “Whereas, the neglect of proper labeling as to actual contents of packaged peaches, tomatoes, strawberries, Irish potatoes, and apples grown in Arkansas; and the attendant unfair and unethical practices of selling inferior products misrepresented as high grade perishables, has resulted in lower prices received by Arkansas producers than are received by growers in competing states, and a generally poor reputation for Arkansas grown products; and

      Notwithstanding subdivision (b)(1) of this section, if an assessment is made under the Soybean Promotion, Research and Consumer Information Act of 1990 upon soybeans grown within the State of Arkansas, then, for so long as such assessment is effective, the assessment imposed and levied under this section shall be twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.25%) of the net market price of all soybeans grown within the State of Arkansas. The assessment of twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.25%) shall not be in addition to the national assessment, but is intended to correspond to the state credit for assessments paid to a qualified state soybean board under the Soybean Promotion, Research and Consumer Information Act of 1990. If an assessment under the Soybean Promotion, Research and Consumer Information Act of 1990 shall cease to be effective, then, for so long as no such assessment is made, the assessment imposed and levied under this section shall be as provided in subdivision (b)(1) of this section.

      <b>
       (3)(A)
      </b>
      So long as the assessment on soybeans provided for in this section is two cents (2¢) per bushel, the question of the levy of the two-cents-per-bushel assessment on soybeans may be referred to a vote of the soybean producers of the state by the filing of petitions with the Arkansas Soybean Promotion Board containing signatures of Arkansas soybean producers equal in number to fifteen percent (15%) of all soybean producers in the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      If the petitions are filed and at the referendum election a majority of the Arkansas soybean producers voting on the question vote against the levy of two cents (2¢) per bushel on soybeans, the assessment shall not thereafter be levied.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      Only those soybean producers who produce soybeans in Arkansas in the crop year immediately preceding the referendum election shall be eligible to vote in the election.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)(1)
      </b>
      The proceeds of the assessment shall be deposited with the Treasurer of State into a special fund to be established for the Arkansas Soybean Promotion Board; provided, that the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration may deduct not more than three percent (3%) to cover the cost of collections.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Disbursement shall be made only upon motion duly passed by the Arkansas Soybean Promotion Board and presented to the Treasurer of State and only for the purposes prescribed in this subchapter.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the Arkansas Rice Research and Promotion Act of 1985 is currently subject to litigation; if the assessment levied under that act is ruled invalid substantial damage to the efforts of marketing Arkansas produced rice will result; that this act provides an assessment which is less subject to attack and will assure the continued funding for the program to promote the sale of Arkansas produced rice; and this act should therefore go into effect at the time the existing assessment is ruled invalid if that occurs. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor.

If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto. However if the occurrences just described occur prior to a court of competent jurisdiction invalidating the current assessment for Rice Research and Promotion, this act shall become effective at the time of that court decision unless the decision occurs later than ninety-one (91) days after adjournment of this regular session in which case this case will become effective ninety-one (91) days after adjournment of the session.”

     Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer [sic], it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

       Complaint to the plant board filed within ten days after defectiveness of seeds became apparent was a condition precedent to legal action against the seed manufacturer and farmer's failure to comply with the mandatory notice requirements precluded his or her legal action for damages; farmer knew as early as July 1998 that the seeds were not germinating properly but did not file a complaint with the board until more than five months later.

      Acts 2015, No. 1169, § 3: Emergency clause failed to pass. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that agriculture is an essential element of Arkansas's economy; that protecting the members of the agricultural community in Arkansas is in the best interests of the state; that the failure of some contractors to notify growers in advance that additional investments may be required under a production contract has resulted in some growers being forced to close their businesses; and that this act is immediately necessary because the unexpected closure of these businesses is harmful to the state's agricultural community and overall economy. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      It is found and determined by the General Assembly that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The Arkansas law which creates the Arkansas Beef Council authorizes an assessment of twenty-five cents (25¢) per head on all cattle sold in the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Since the enactment of the Arkansas law, the United States Congress and the United States Department of Agriculture have established a national beef promotion and research program under which there is an assessment of one dollar ($1.00) per head on all cattle sold;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      Under the national program, a qualified state beef council is authorized to retain fifty cents (50¢) of each one dollar ($1.00) per head assessment for financing a state beef promotion and research program if authorized by state law;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      The one dollar ($1.00) per head national assessment is currently required to be collected but is subject to a referendum within twenty-two (22) months after the issuance of the beef promotion and research order by the United States Secretary of Agriculture;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      It is essential that appropriate legislation be enacted in Arkansas to provide for the collection of the one dollar ($1.00) per head assessment and the retention by the state of fifty cents (50¢) of each one dollar ($1.00) assessment during the interim from the date of the order until the referendum process is completed and thereafter in the event the producers voting at the referendum approve a continuation of the assessment; to further assure that in the event the producers voting at the referendum vote against continuing the one dollar ($1.00) per head assessment, the present Arkansas law providing for an assessment of twenty-five cents (25¢) per head will be automatically reactivated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (b)
   
   Therefore, it is the intent and purpose of this subchapter to suspend the collection of the twenty-five cents (25¢) per head assessment provided for in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t02c35s2-35-301" target="_self">2-35-301</a></cite> et seq. and to provide for the collection of the one dollar ($1.00) per head national assessment levied for beef promotion and research so long as the national program continues in effect, with fifty cents (50¢) of the assessment to be retained for the Arkansas Beef Council, and to provide that if the producers voting at the referendum provided for in the Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 and the administrative order issued pursuant thereto vote to discontinue the one dollar ($1.00) per head national assessment, then the provisions of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t02c35s2-35-301" target="_self">2-35-301</a></cite> et seq. and the assessment of twenty-five cents (25¢) per head of cattle sold in this state will be reactivated the same as if the national program had never existed.

     <p>
      Subdivision (a)(1) was amended by both Acts 2011, No. 116, § 1, and No. 131, § 1. While the amendment by Acts 2011, No. 131, § 1, only concerned the removal of Independence County from the Northeast Arkansas District Fair Advisory Board, the amendment by Acts 2011, No. 116, § 1, made the same removal of Independence County from the Northeast Arkansas District Fair Advisory Board but also made other substantive changes to (a)(1). Given that the only substantive change made to subdivision (a)(1) by Acts 2011, No. 131, § 1, was also made by Acts 2011, No. 116, § 1, but Acts 2011, No. 116, § 1, made additional substantive changes, subdivision (a)(1) is set out above as amended by Acts 2011, No. 116, § 1, effective July 27, 2011.

       (1)(A)
      </b>
      When the State Plant Board or its authorized agent has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or any of the prescribed rules under this chapter, the board may issue and enforce a written or printed “withdrawal from distribution” order, warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of commercial feed in any manner until written permission is given by the board or the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      The board shall release the lot of commercial feed so withdrawn when the provisions and rules have been complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      If compliance is not obtained the board may begin, or upon request of the distributor or registrant, shall begin proceedings for condemnation.

      <b>
       (2)

      </b>
      Any lot of commercial feed not in compliance with the provisions and rules shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the board to a court of competent jurisdiction in the area in which the commercial feed is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)(A)
      </b>
      In the event the court finds the commercial feed to be in violation of this chapter and orders the condemnation of the commercial feed, it shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with the quality of the commercial feed and the laws of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      However, in no instance shall the disposition of the commercial feed be ordered by the court without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of the commercial feed or for permission to process or re-label the commercial feed to bring it into compliance with this chapter.

      In all counties of this state where there has been or may be submitted to the people by initiative petition a proposed act prohibiting horses, mules, cattle, hogs, sheep, and goats, or any of them, from running at large in the county and at an election held pursuant thereto, the electors voting thereon have enacted or shall enact such an act, it shall be unlawful from the effective date of the act for any animals, at any time during the year, to run at large and enter in and upon the fields and lands of the county, either enclosed or unenclosed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)(1)
      </b>
      In every case of trespass by an animal described and prohibited by the initiated act, the owner of the animal shall be liable, for all damages it may do, to the person owning crops, to be established and recovered in a civil action.

      A lien shall exist against the animal in favor of the person whose crops may have been damaged or destroyed, and they may be sold under an order of the court rendering judgment for damages, to which shall be added any and all costs of taking up, feeding, and caring for the animal, and other costs.

       2-38-303. Notice to owners of hogs and goats.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Hogs and goats when permitted to run at large are especially destructive of growing and unharvested crops of corn, oats, other small grains, and of winter cover crops; they are especially difficult and often practically impossible to catch and take up when preying upon these crops. To protect these crops, the animals must be removed or their destructiveness stopped without long delay. Therefore, a notice of twenty-four (24) hours shall be deemed sufficient to enable the owners of these animals to take up and confine them, the notice being sufficient if given verbally or otherwise to the owner, his or her agent, or his or her servant. If these animals are not taken up and confined, any person interested in the preservation of the crops either as landlord, tenant, cropper, or the agent or servant of either of them, may kill and destroy any offending hogs or goats and shall not be liable in damages for, or for the value of, the destroyed animals to any person because of having done so.
