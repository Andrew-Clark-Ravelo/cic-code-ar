     <p>
      (1)The bylaws or the marketing or participation contract of any association existing under this subchapter may fix specific sums as liquidated damages to be paid by the member or stockholder to the association upon the breach or threatened breach by him or her of any provision of the participation agreement or upon the breach or threatened breach by him or her of any provision of the marketing contract regarding the sale or delivery or withholding of products.
     </p>
     <p>
      These instruments may further provide that the member will pay all costs, premiums for bonds, expenses, and fees in case any action is brought upon the contract by the association.
     </p>
     <p>
      These provisions shall be valid and enforceable in the courts of this state, and the clauses providing for liquidated damages shall be enforceable as such and shall not be regarded as penalties.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)In the event of any breach or threatened breach of the marketing contract by a member or other person, the association shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent the breach or further breach of the contract and to a decree of specific performance of the contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)Pending the adjudication of the action and upon filing a verified complaint showing the breach or threatened breach and upon filing a bond in the sum of one hundred dollars ($100), the association shall be entitled to an injunction against the member or other person.
     </p>
     <p>
      The judge, in his or her discretion, may increase the bond to five hundred dollars ($500), after a hearing on five (5) days' notice to the parties if justice demands an increase in the amount of the bond.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the declared policy of the state to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural and forest lands and other facilities for the production of food, fiber, and other agricultural and silvicultural products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural areas, agricultural operations often become the subject of nuisance suits. As a result, agricultural operations are sometimes forced to cease operations. Many are discouraged from making investments in farm or other agricultural improvements. It is the purpose of this chapter to reduce the loss to the state of its agricultural resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to be a nuisance.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that a burden on and an obstruction to intrastate commerce in the catfish farming industry is caused when payment is not made for the catfish and that these arrangements are contrary to the public interest. This chapter is intended to remedy this burden on and obstruction to intrastate commerce in catfish and to protect the public interest.

   Trial court did not err in refusing to apply the Arkansas Farm Mediation Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t02c07s2-7-101" target="_self">2-7-101</a></cite> et seq., to an action relating to a writ of execution where a debtor failed to show that this proceeding was in connection with a secured indebtedness. Moreover, he did not make it clear that the loans were secured by real estate, crops, livestock, farm machinery, or other agricultural supplies, as required in the definition of a “farmer.”

     <p>
      (1)Within a reasonable time after July 30, 1999, the Arkansas Catfish Promotion Board shall cause an election to be held on the question of the levy of an assessment on the sale of catfish feed within the State of Arkansas to commercial catfish producers at a rate determined by the board, such rate of assessment not to exceed five dollars ($5.00) per ton of catfish feed sold.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a majority of the commercial catfish producers voting at the election vote for the levy of the assessment, the assessment shall be applicable to all sales of catfish feed made on and after a date specified by the board, which date shall not be later than ninety (90) calendar days after certification of the results of the election.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessment shall be a continuing levy until either terminated by the board or until another election is held at which a majority of the commercial catfish producers voting at an election vote against the levy. The rate of assessment approved at an election shall not be increased except under the majority vote of the commercial catfish producers voting at a subsequent election.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)When petitions containing the signatures of thirty percent (30%) of the commercial catfish producers in the state, as determined by the latest available agricultural census data, are filed with the board requesting that the question of continuing the assessment be submitted to a vote of the catfish producers, the board shall cause an election to be held within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing of the petitions, to be conducted in the same manner as the initial election held on the question of the levy of the assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a majority of the commercial catfish producers voting at the election vote against the levy of the assessment, the assessment shall not be levied as of the date ten (10) calendar days after the date of the election. The levy may be reapproved, in the same manner as the initial election and subject to the same vote requirements, at an election called by the board not earlier than twelve (12) months after the date of the previous election suspending the levy of the assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)The assessment imposed and levied by this section shall be collected by the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration from each seller of catfish feed, who shall add the assessment to the purchase price of catfish feed sold in this state to commercial catfish producers.
     </p>
     <p>

      The State Plant Board is empowered to recover any identifiable expenses from the owner or other person in possession or control of the property upon which it enforces, maintains, and administers any quarantine that is imposed due to infestations or infections of insect pests, diseases, or noxious weeds. Whenever the owner or other person cannot be found or shall fail, neglect, or refuse to reimburse the board for incurred quarantine expenses, the board shall have and enforce a lien for such expenses upon the property upon which it enforces, maintains, or administers any quarantine, in the same manner as liens are had and enforced upon property for labor and materials furnished by virtue of contract with the owner.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer [sic], it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     Acts 1997, No. 317, § 8: Mar. 3, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 10 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1995 abolished the Joint Interim Committee on Agriculture and Economic Development and in its place established separate House and Senate Committees; that various sections of the Arkansas Code refer to the Joint Interim Committee on Agriculture and Economic Development and should be corrected to refer to the House and Senate Interim Committees; that this act so provides; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to make the laws compatible as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

     Acts 2019, No. 423, § 2: Mar. 11, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that delay in implementation of this act would hinder the State Plant Board from enforcing egregious violations during the 2019 growing season, which could have a detrimental impact on the state's agricultural economy. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

     Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer [sic], it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      <li id="t02c16s2-16-402ol1a">
       The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate in the public interest the labeling, distribution, storage, transportation, and disposal of pesticides as defined in this subchapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c16s2-16-402ol1b">
       Pesticides are valuable to our state's agricultural production and to the protection of man and the environment from insects, rodents, weeds, and other forms of life which may be pests; but it is essential to the public health and welfare that they be regulated to prevent adverse effects on human life and the environment.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c16s2-16-402ol1c">
       New pesticides are continually being discovered, synthesized, or developed which are valuable for the control of pests and for use as defoliants, desiccants, plant regulators, spray adjuvants, and related purposes. However, such pesticides may be ineffective, may cause injury to man, or may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c16s2-16-402ol1d">
       Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for regulation of pesticides.

      (1)The sampling and examination of pesticides or devices shall be made by the State Plant Board for the purpose of determining whether they comply with the requirements of this subchapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board is authorized to enter any distributor's premises, including any vehicle of transport, at all reasonable times in order to have access to pesticides or devices packaged or labeled for distribution and to collect samples of the contents, containers, or labeling for the pesticides or devices.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an analysis is made of the samples, a copy of the results of the analysis shall be furnished promptly to the owner, operator, or agent in charge.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it appears from the examination that a pesticide or device fails to comply with the provisions of this subchapter or rules adopted hereunder and the board contemplates instituting criminal proceedings against any person, the board shall cause appropriate notice to be given to that person.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person so notified shall be given an opportunity within a reasonable time to present his or her views, either orally or in writing, with regard to the contemplated proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      If thereafter, in the opinion of the board, it appears that the provisions of this subchapter or rules adopted hereunder have been violated by the person, the board shall refer a copy of the results of the analysis or the examination of the pesticide or device to the prosecuting attorney for the county in which the violation occurred.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this subchapter, the board may enter upon any public or private premises at reasonable times in order to inspect storage or disposal areas or sample pesticides being applied or to be applied.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should the board be denied access to any premises or other areas where access was sought for the purposes set forth in this subchapter, it may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a search warrant authorizing access to those premises or other areas for the purposes set forth in this subchapter. The court may, upon such application, issue the search warrant for the purposes requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board, with or without the aid and advice of the prosecuting attorney, is charged with the duty of enforcing the requirements of this subchapter and any rules issued thereunder. In the event a prosecuting attorney refuses to act on behalf of the board, the Attorney General may so act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board is authorized to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for, and the court upon hearing and for cause shown may grant, a temporary or permanent injunction. This injunction shall restrain any person from violating any provisions of this subchapter or of the rules made under authority of this subchapter and shall be without bond.

     </p>
     <p>
      The court in the action may issue temporary or permanent injunctions, mandatory or restraining orders, and such intermediate orders as it deems necessary or advisable.

     <p>
      The pesticide or device shall not be sold contrary to the provisions of this subchapter or rules adopted hereunder.

     <p>
      Upon payment of costs and execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that the pesticide or device shall not be disposed of unlawfully, the court may direct that the pesticide or device be delivered to its owner for relabeling, reprocessing, removing from the state, or otherwise bringing the product into compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a decree of condemnation is entered against the pesticide or device, court costs, fees, storage, and other proper expenses shall be awarded against the person, if any, appearing as claimant of the pesticide.

     <p>
      No state court shall allow the recovery of damages from administrative action taken or for stop-sale, use, or removal if the court finds that there was probable cause for such action.

       2-16-614. Referendum — Assessments.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      (1)At the request of the certified cotton growers' organization, the State Plant Board shall authorize a referendum among cotton growers in a designated region on the question of whether an assessment shall be levied upon cotton growers in that region to offset, in whole or in part, the cost of boll weevil suppression, preeradication, eradication, or maintenance programs authorized by this subchapter or any other law of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The program shall be designed on a regional basis to reflect the differences in boll weevil infestation and the relative costs of financing boll weevil suppression and eradication programs in the respective regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)The assessment levied under this subchapter shall be based upon the number of acres of cotton planted in the eradication area.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount of the assessment, the period of time for which it shall be levied, how it shall be levied, when it shall be paid, and the geographical area to be covered by the assessment shall be determined by the board and established by rules under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The annual assessment shall not exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) per acre.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)All affected cotton growers shall be entitled to vote in any such referendum; provided, however, that the affected cotton growers produced a cotton crop for harvest, or had an interest therein, in the designated region conducting the referendum in the crop year immediately preceding the year in which the referendum is conducted.
     </p>
     <p>
      A cotton grower may vote through a power of attorney evidenced in writing, including, but not limited to, a power of attorney recognized by the United States Farm Service Agency or its successor. The board or its cooperators shall determine any questions of eligibility to vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each person who is eligible to vote in the referendum shall be mailed a ballot upon which to cast a vote for or against the boll weevil suppression and eradication program.
     </p>
     <p>
      Passage of the referendum shall require an affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of those voting in the referendum.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)The assessments approved under this subchapter shall be collected by the certified cotton growers' organization or such other agency or entity designated by the board from the affected cotton growers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessments collected by the board or such other agency or entity designated by the board under this subchapter shall be promptly remitted to the certified cotton growers' organization under such terms and conditions as the board shall deem necessary to ensure that the assessments are used in a sound program of eradication or suppression of the boll weevil.
     </p>
     <p>
      The certified organization shall provide to the board an annual audit of its accounts performed by a certified public accountant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessments collected by the board under this subchapter shall not be state funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)In addition to the authority granted in this section for a referendum among cotton growers, the board may conduct a separate referendum among cotton growers in the southwest corner of the state, within boundaries to be defined by the board, on the question of whether an assessment shall be levied upon cotton growers in the defined area to provide funds to fund in whole or in part the cost of a boll weevil suppression or eradication program.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any such regional referendum shall be conducted in the same manner as any other referendum authorized in this section, and any assessments levied under such a referendum shall be subject to the same uses and limitations and shall be made, collected, and remitted in the same manner as assessments levied under any other referenda conducted under this subchapter.

       2-16-617. Failure to pay assessments — Extensions — Exemption.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      (1)A cotton grower who fails to pay when due and upon reasonable notice any assessment levied under this subchapter shall be subject to a per-acre penalty as established in the State Plant Board's rules in addition to the assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      A cotton grower who fails to pay all assessments, including penalties, within thirty (30) days' notice of penalty shall destroy any cotton plants growing on his or her acreage which is subject to the assessment. Any such cotton plants which are not destroyed shall be deemed to be a public nuisance, and the public nuisance may be abated in the same manner as any public nuisance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may petition the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the public nuisance is located to have the nuisance condemned and destroyed, with all costs of destroying to be levied against the grower. This injunctive relief shall be available to the board notwithstanding the existence of any other legal remedy, and the board shall not be required to file a bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)In addition to any other remedies for the collection of assessments, including penalties, the board may secure a lien upon cotton subject to the assessments.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)If the cotton was grown on a cost-share basis, the lien may be perfected on the landowner's share and the grower's share of the cotton.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any buyer of cotton shall take free of the lien if he or she has not received written notice of the lien from the board or if he or she has paid for the cotton by a check in which the board is named as joint payee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount of the lien on the cotton shall reflect the landowner's and grower's proportionate share of the assessment.

       2-16-901. Pest Control Compact.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Pest Control Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IFindings
     </p>
     <p>
      The party states find that:
     </p>
     <ol class="alpha">
      <li id="t02c16s2-16-901ol1a">
       In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this Compact, the annual loss of approximately 137 billion dollars from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c16s2-16-901ol1b">
       Because of the varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c16s2-16-901ol1c">
       The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another, to complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c16s2-16-901ol1d">
       While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crops and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an Insurance Fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interest, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.

        Article IIIThe Insurance Fund
       </p>
       <p>
        There is hereby established a Pest Control Insurance Fund for the purpose of financing other than normal pest control operations which states may be called upon to engage in pursuant to this Compact. The Insurance Fund shall contain moneys appropriated to it by the party states and any donations and grants accepted by it. All appropriations, except as conditioned by the rights and obligations of party states expressly set forth in this Compact, shall be unconditional and may not be restricted by the appropriating state to use in the control of any specified pest or pests. Donations and grants may be conditional or unconditional, provided that the Insurance Fund shall not accept any donation or grant whose terms are inconsistent with any provision of this Compact.

       The Governing Board shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of the business of the Insurance Fund and shall have the power to amend and to rescind these bylaws.

      </li>
      <li id="t02c16s2-16-901ol1i">
       The Insurance Fund annually shall make to the Governor and legislature of each party state a report covering its activities for the preceding year. The Insurance Fund may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.

     </p>
     <p>
      The members of the Governing Board shall be entitled to one vote on such board. No action of the Governing Board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the Governing Board is cast in favor thereof.

The Governing Board in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, or corporation.

     <p>
      The Insurance Fund may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this Compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. Any donation, gift, or grant accepted by the Governing Board pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Article shall be reported in the annual report of the Insurance Fund.

     </p>
     <p>
      If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefore within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the Governing Board of the Insurance Fund by not to exceed three representatives. Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, but no such representative shall have a vote on the Governing Board or the Executive Committee thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board shall meet at least once each year for the purpose of determining policies and procedures in the administration of the Insurance Fund and, consistent with the provisions of the Compact, supervising and giving direction to the expenditure of moneys from the Insurance Fund. Additional meetings of the Governing Board shall be held on call of the chairman, the Executive Committee, or a majority of the membership of the Governing Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      At such times as it may be meeting, the Governing Board shall pass upon applications for assistance from the Insurance Fund and authorize disbursements therefrom. When the Governing Board is not in session, the Executive Committee thereof shall act as agent of the Governing Board, with full authority to act for it in passing upon such applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Executive Committee shall be composed of the chairman of the Governing Board and four additional members of the Governing Board chosen by it so that there shall be one member representing each of four geographic groupings of party states. The Governing Board shall make such geographic groupings. If there is representation of the United States on the Governing Board, one such representative may meet with the Executive Committee. The chairman of the Governing Board shall be chairman of the Executive Committee. No action of the Executive Committee shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which at least four members of such Committee are present and vote in favor thereof. Necessary expenses of each of the five members of the Executive Committee incurred in attending meetings of such Committee, when not held at the same time and place as a meeting of the Governing Board, shall be charges against the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each party state pledges to each other party state that it will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the strictest practicable limits, any and all pests. It is recognized that performance of this responsibility involves:
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present within its borders but present within another party state, or whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may request the Governing Board to authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent, or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or reinfestation of the requesting state. Upon such authorization the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use moneys available from the Insurance Fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to apply for expenditures from the Insurance Fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall give due notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the Insurance Fund is to be considered. Such notice shall be given to the Compact administrator of each party state and to such other officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party states. The requesting state and any other party state shall be entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the submission as required by paragraph (c) of this Article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes of this Compact and justified thereby, the Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize support of the program. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and all determinations of the Governing Board or Executive Committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefore shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a determination of the Executive Committee shall upon notice in writing given within twenty days of the determination with which it is dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next meeting of the Governing Board. Determinations of the Executive Committee shall be reviewable only by the Governing Board at one of its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as the Governing Board may authorize.
     </p>
     <p>
      Responding states required to undertake or increase measures pursuant to this Compact may receive moneys from the Insurance Fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for expenses incurred and chargeable to the Insurance Fund. The Governing Board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before authorizing the expenditure of moneys from the Insurance Fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the Insurance Fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely assistance or participation which may be available from the federal government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of the federal government for such assistance and participation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent and degree of assistance or participation between and among the Insurance Fund, cooperating federal agencies, states, and any other entities concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      A party state may make application for assistance from the Insurance Fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state. Such application shall be considered and disposed of by the Governing Board or Executive Committee in the same manner as an application with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in this Article.
     </p>
     <p>
      At or in connection with any meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI (d) of this Compact a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate, and receive information only to such extent as the Governing Board or Executive Committee may provide. A nonparty state shall not be entitled to review of any determination made by the Executive Committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund to be made in a nonparty state only after determining that the conditions in such state and the value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify them. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may set any conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure of moneys from the Insurance Fund in a nonparty state and may enter into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the Insurance Fund with respect to expenditures and activities outside of party states.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget for the Insurance Fund for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for a presentation to the legislature thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each of the budgets shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The request for appropriations shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-tenth of the total budget in equal shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products, produced in each party state. In determining the value of such crops and products the Insurance Fund may employ such source or sources of information as in its judgment present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the budgets and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of products.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial assets of the Insurance Fund shall be maintained in two accounts to be designated respectively as the “Operating Account” and the “Claims Account.” The Operating Account shall consist only of those assets necessary for the administration of the Insurance Fund during the next ensuing two-year period. The Claims Account shall contain all moneys not included in the Operating Account and shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be sufficient to pay all legitimate claims on the Insurance Fund for a period of three years. At any time when the Claims Account has reached its maximum limit or would reach its maximum limit by the addition of moneys requested for appropriation by the party states, the Governing Board shall reduce its budget requests on a pro rata basis in such manner as to keep the Claims Account within such maximum limit. Any moneys in the Claims Account by virtue of conditional donations, grants, or gifts shall be included in calculations made pursuant to this paragraph only to the extent that such moneys are available to meet demands arising out of the claims.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The Insurance Fund may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with moneys available to it under Article IV (g) of this Compact, provided that the Governing Board take specific action setting aside such moneys prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Insurance Fund makes use of moneys available to it under Article IV (g) hereof, the Insurance Fund shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of moneys by the party states adequate to meet the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Insurance Fund shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Insurance Fund shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The accounts of the Insurance Fund shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly authorized officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any five or more states. Thereafter, this Compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until two years after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.

      (1)Applications for licenses under this subchapter are to be made on forms prescribed by the Public Grain Warehouse Commissioner for each warehouse.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every application is to be accompanied by an application fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150) and a certified financial statement in a form prescribed by the commissioner and any further information the commissioner may by rule require.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)If a warehouseman operates one (1) or more warehouses in the same city or town in conjunction with each other, if only one (1) set of books is kept for all the warehouses and scale tickets, and if warehouse receipts and checks of but one (1) series are issued for grain received or stored therein, then only one (1) license and bond shall be required for the operation of all the warehouses. In these cases, the license fee prescribed in this section shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate capacity of all warehouses operated by the licensee.

      (1)(A)(i)Before any license is issued to any warehouseman, the warehouseman shall file with the Public Grain Warehouse Commissioner a surety bond executed by the public grain warehouseman as principal and by a corporate surety licensed to do business in this state as surety.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bond shall run to the State of Arkansas and be for the benefit of all depositors or storers of grain, their legal representatives, attorneys, or assigns.
     </p>
     <p>
      (i)No bond shall be accepted for the purposes of this subchapter until it has been approved by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bond shall be conditioned upon the warehouseman delivering all stored grain or payment of the value thereof upon the surrender of the warehouse receipt.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may require the increases in the amount of the bond, from time to time, as he or she may deem necessary for the protection of the storage receipt holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)The aggregate liability of the surety to all depositors or storers of grain shall not exceed the sum of the bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bond may be cancelled at any time by the surety by giving written notice to the commissioner of its intention to cancel the bond. All liability thereunder shall terminate thirty (30) days after the receipt of the notice by the commissioner, except that the notice shall not affect any claims arising under the bond, whether presented or not, before the effective date of the cancellation notice.

   In lieu of the bond required in subsection (a) of this section, an applicant for a license may be a self-insurer by posting with the commissioner cash or any combination of securities, the market value of which is readily ascertainable and, if negotiable, by delivery or assignment, of the kinds described in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.23.html#t23c63s23-63-806" target="_blank">23-63-806</a></cite>, United States Government obligations, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.23.html#t23c63s23-63-809" target="_blank">23-63-809</a></cite>, municipal or county utilities, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.23.html#t23c63s23-63-813" target="_blank">23-63-813</a></cite>, international banks, and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.23.html#t23c63s23-63-814" target="_blank">23-63-814</a></cite>, corporate bonds and debentures.

    <p>
     “Whereas, the necessity for high grade planting seed for agricultural crops is hereby recognized, the purpose of this act shall be to enable farmers to secure pure bred agricultural seeds true to variety, free from noxious weed seeds and free from plant diseases transmittable through the agency of planting seed and free from insect infestation … .”

      Effective Dates.
     </b>
     Acts 1997, No. 317, § 8: Mar. 3, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 10 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1995 abolished the Joint Interim Committee on Agriculture and Economic Development and in its place established separate House and Senate Committees; that various sections of the Arkansas Code refer to the Joint Interim Committee on Agriculture and Economic Development and should be corrected to refer to the House and Senate Interim Committees; that this act so provides; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to make the laws compatible as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

       (1)If any commercial fertilizer or fertilizer material offered for sale in this state shall, upon official analysis, prove deficient from its guarantee as stated on the bag or other container, to the extent of three percent (3%) and not over five percent (5%), then the manufacturer of the commercial fertilizer or fertilizer materials or his or her agent shall be liable for the actual deficiency as shown by the official analysis.

     </b>
     Acts 1947, No. 343 contained a preamble which read:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas, the neglect of proper labeling as to actual contents of packaged peaches, tomatoes, strawberries, Irish potatoes, and apples grown in Arkansas; and the attendant unfair and unethical practices of selling inferior products misrepresented as high grade perishables, has resulted in lower prices received by Arkansas producers than are received by growers in competing states, and a generally poor reputation for Arkansas grown products; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whereas, reputable producers of these products in this state have suffered unfairly a consumer reaction against their products, the following act is proposed for their protection against such unfair marketing practices and in order that an improved and recognized quality of Arkansas packaged peaches, tomatoes, strawberries, Irish potatoes, and apples may be sold in competition with such products grown in other states … .”

The assessment of twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.25%) shall not be in addition to the national assessment, but is intended to correspond to the state credit for assessments paid to a qualified state soybean board under the Soybean Promotion, Research and Consumer Information Act of 1990. If an assessment under the Soybean Promotion, Research and Consumer Information Act of 1990 shall cease to be effective, then, for so long as no such assessment is made, the assessment imposed and levied under this section shall be as provided in subdivision (b)(1) of this section.

     <p>
      (A)So long as the assessment on soybeans provided for in this section is two cents (2¢) per bushel, the question of the levy of the two-cents-per-bushel assessment on soybeans may be referred to a vote of the soybean producers of the state by the filing of petitions with the Arkansas Soybean Promotion Board containing signatures of Arkansas soybean producers equal in number to fifteen percent (15%) of all soybean producers in the state.

    A.C.R.C. Notes.
   
   On July 15, 1999, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the chancery court decree which invalidated the buyer's asessment levied under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t02c20s2-20-511" target="_self">2-20-511</a></cite>. Tim Leathers, Comm'r of Revenues, et al v. Gulf Rice Arkansas, Inc. and Gulf Pacific Rice Co., Inc., No. 98-737 (Ark. Sup. Ct. July 15, 1999). Accordingly, pursuant to Acts 1999, No. 16, § 10, the effective date of 1999, No. 16, is July 15, 1999.

    <p>
     Acts 1999, No. 16, § 10: July 15, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the Arkansas Rice Research and Promotion Act of 1985 is currently subject to litigation; if the assessment levied under that act is ruled invalid substantial damage to the efforts of marketing Arkansas produced rice will result; that this act provides an assessment which is less subject to attack and will assure the continued funding for the program to promote the sale of Arkansas produced rice; and this act should therefore go into effect at the time the existing assessment is ruled invalid if that occurs. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto. However if the occurrences just described occur prior to a court of competent jurisdiction invalidating the current assessment for Rice Research and Promotion, this act shall become effective at the time of that court decision unless the decision occurs later than ninety-one (91) days after adjournment of this regular session in which case this case will become effective ninety-one (91) days after adjournment of the session.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 2005, No. 852, § 3: Mar. 15, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act clarifies the use of funds from assessments on grown rice; and that this act is immediately necessary in order to avoid future controversies and to ensure the proper use of the funds. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

     <p>
      (1)The Arkansas Corn and Grain Sorghum Promotion Board shall appoint three (3) corn or grain sorghum producers from each county who will be responsible for holding a referendum in the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board will set the dates for the referendum and prescribe procedures to be followed in conducting the referendum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Voting shall be in farm service agency offices under supervision of the three (3) producers appointed to hold the referendum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ballots will be furnished by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The results shall be certified not more than three (3) days after election on forms furnished by the board by registered mail to the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall be reimbursed from funds collected for costs of holding the referendum.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)There is imposed and levied an assessment at the rate of one cent (1¢) per bushel on all corn and grain sorghum grown within the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      This assessment is to be deducted from the amount paid the producer at the first point of sale, whether within or without the state or at the point the corn or grain sorghum enters into the United States Department of Agriculture loan program. However, the assessment shall not be imposed unless and until:
     </p>
     <p>
      The question of its imposition has been submitted to and approved by sixty percent (60%) of the corn and grain sorghum producers who vote in the referendum to be called and held within nine (9) months following July 1, 1997; and
     </p>
     <p>
      A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the total corn and grain sorghum producers in this state as determined by latest available agricultural census data shall have voted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The corn and grain sorghum producers shall be notified by the board of the results of the referendum.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessment imposed in this section shall be effective beginning July 1, 1998.
     </p>
     <p>
      This assessment may be extended for an indefinite period of time or until twenty percent (20%) of the producers shall petition the board to hold a referendum on whether the program should be continued, then another referendum shall be called by the board in the manner set forth in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      In all such referenda, in order to be eligible to vote, the producer must have produced corn or grain sorghum in the crop year immediately preceding the referendum.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)The assessment imposed and levied by this section shall be collected by the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration from the buyer of corn or grain sorghum at the first point of sale or when the corn or grain sorghum enters the United States Department of Agriculture loan program.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceeds of the assessment, less not more than three percent (3%) to cover the cost of collections, shall be deposited with the Treasurer of State in a special fund to be established for the board to the credit of the board. Disbursement from the special fund shall be made only upon a motion duly passed by the board and presented to the Treasurer of State and only for a purpose prescribed in this subchapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Amendments.
      </b>
      The 2019 amendment substituted “Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration” for “Director of the Department of Finance and Administration” in (c)(1); and substituted “secretary” for “director” throughout (d)(3) through (d)(5).

      (1)For the enforcement of this chapter, the apiary inspector shall have, where any apiary is located or any bees, combs, or apiary appliances are kept, the authority to enter upon any private or public premises with right of access, ingress, and egress for the purpose of ascertaining the existence of the disease known as American foulbrood or European foulbrood or any other disease which is infectious or contagious and injurious to bees in their egg, larval, pupal, or adult stages.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)Before exercising that authority, the inspector must afford the beekeeper the opportunity to be present during the inspection by serving notice of the date and time of inspection at least five (5) days before the inspection.
     </p>
     <p>
      The five-day period may be abbreviated upon the mutual consent of the inspector and the beekeeper.

     </p>
     <p>
      The application shall set forth the exact location by legal description of the premises, together with the name of the owner or possessor of the apiary, the number of colonies of bees in each apiary owned by him or her or in his or her possession or under his or her control, together with such other information as may be required by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The beekeeper may register one (1) location for each ten (10) colonies for the first one thousand (1,000) colonies and may register one (1) location for each twenty (20) colonies thereafter.

     <p>
      A new registration is required when any significant change occurs in the location or operation of the beekeeper.

      (1)No person can place bees on property other than his or her own within three (3) miles of a previously registered area without the written permission of the registrant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon written complaint made to the board by any beekeeper or any landowner whose land is in the registered area that the registrant or any other person claiming prior bee pasturage rights is not properly covering the area so registered, then the board shall be authorized to permit the placing in such area of other bees or bee yards as, in its judgment, shall be sufficient.

     Acts 2015, No. 601, § 2: Mar. 23, 2015. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that agriculture is an essential part of Arkansas's economy; that protecting Arkansas farmers is in the best interests of the state; that grain dealers must be regulated to protect Arkansas farmers and the state's economy from the devastating financial impact that the failure of one (1) or more of these grain dealers could have on the farmers' financial well-being and the state's economy; and that this act is immediately necessary because failure to adequately regulate these grain dealers could have immediate and far-reaching effects on Arkansas's economy and the financial stability of the state's agriculture community. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     Acts 2015, No. 1169, § 3: Emergency clause failed to pass. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that agriculture is an essential element of Arkansas's economy; that protecting the members of the agricultural community in Arkansas is in the best interests of the state; that the failure of some contractors to notify growers in advance that additional investments may be required under a production contract has resulted in some growers being forced to close their businesses; and that this act is immediately necessary because the unexpected closure of these businesses is harmful to the state's agricultural community and overall economy. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1989.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019.

       (1)Within ninety (90) days after February 14, 1983, the Arkansas Beef Council shall cause an election to be held on the question of the levy of an assessment of twenty-five cents (25¢) per head on all cattle sold in the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election shall be held at the offices of the United States Farm Service Agency in each county in the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The council shall set the date for conducting the election in each county, shall furnish ballots for the election, and shall prescribe voting procedures for the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each cattle owner or producer who owned or produced cattle in the year immediately preceding the election may vote in the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1)If a majority of the cattle owners and producers in the state voting at the election vote for the levy of an assessment of twenty-five cents (25¢) per head on cattle sold in the state, the assessment shall be applicable to all sales made on and after a date specified by the council. The date shall not be later than ninety (90) days after certification of the results of the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assessment shall be a continuing levy until either terminated by the council or until another election is held at which a majority of the cattle owners and producers in the state vote against the levy.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1)When petitions containing the signatures of twenty percent (20%) of the cattle owners and producers in the state, as determined by the latest available agricultural census, are filed with the council requesting that the question of continuing the per-head assessment be submitted to a vote of the cattle owners and producers, the council shall cause an election to be held within ninety (90) days after the filing of the petitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election shall be conducted in the same manner as the initial election held on the question of the levy of the assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a majority of the owners and producers voting at the election vote against the levy of the assessment, the assessment shall not be levied unless and until the levy is thereafter approved at an election called by the council.

Given that the only substantive change made to subdivision (a)(1) by Acts 2011, No. 131, § 1, was also made by Acts 2011, No. 116, § 1, but Acts 2011, No. 116, § 1, made additional substantive changes, subdivision (a)(1) is set out above as amended by Acts 2011, No. 116, § 1, effective July 27, 2011. The amendment made to subdivision (a)(1) by Acts 2011, No. 131, § 1, read as follows:

     <p>
      An inspection fee at the rate of thirty cents ($.30) per ton shall be paid on commercial feeds distributed in this state by the person whose name appears on the label as the manufacturer, guarantor or distributor, except that a person other than the manufacturer, guarantor or distributor may assume liability for the inspection fee, subject to the following:

      Each person who is liable for the payment of such fee shall:

     <p>
      File, not later than the last day in January, April, July, and October of each year, quarterly statement, setting forth the number of net tons of commercial feeds distributed in this state during the preceding three (3) months; and upon filing such statement shall pay the inspection fee at the rate stated in subsection (a) of this section. Inspection fees which are due and owing and have not been remitted to the State Plant Board within fifteen (15) days following the date due shall have a penalty fee of fifteen percent (15%) or twenty-five dollars ($25.00), whichever is the higher, added to the amount due when payment is finally made. The assessment of this penalty fee shall not prevent the board from taking other actions as provided in this chapter.
     </p>

Failure to make an accurate statement of tonnage or to pay the inspection fee or comply as provided herein shall constitute sufficient cause for the cancellation of the license of a distributor.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Hogs and goats when permitted to run at large are especially destructive of growing and unharvested crops of corn, oats, other small grains, and of winter cover crops; they are especially difficult and often practically impossible to catch and take up when preying upon these crops. To protect these crops, the animals must be removed or their destructiveness stopped without long delay. Therefore, a notice of twenty-four (24) hours shall be deemed sufficient to enable the owners of these animals to take up and confine them, the notice being sufficient if given verbally or otherwise to the owner, his or her agent, or his or her servant. If these animals are not taken up and confined, any person interested in the preservation of the crops either as landlord, tenant, cropper, or the agent or servant of either of them, may kill and destroy any offending hogs or goats and shall not be liable in damages for, or for the value of, the destroyed animals to any person because of having done so.

Emergency clause provided: “It has been found and is declared by the General Assembly of Arkansas that animals running at large along and on the public highways of the State of Arkansas constitute a hazard to travelers upon said highways and have caused numerous highway accidents which have resulted in serious and painful injury and death to travelers upon the highway, and that the penalties provided for any person permitting animals to run at large upon the highway have been ineffective to eliminate this traffic hazard, and that there is urgent need for immediate action to render travel upon the highways less hazardous, and the enactment of this bill will reduce the hazards of highway travel. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety it shall take effect and be in force from the date of its approval.”

Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer [sic], it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.
