       A.C.R.C. Notes.
      </b>
      Acts 2013, No. 724, § 1, provided: “Legislative intent.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Article 5, § 9, of the Constitution of the State of Arkansas states that ‘[n]o person hereafter convicted of embezzlement of public money, bribery, forgery or other infamous crime, shall be eligible to the General Assembly or capable of holding any office of trust or profit in this State’.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      In interpreting that constitutional provision, the Supreme Court of Arkansas has ‘consistently recognized that a person convicted of a felony or one of the specifically enumerated offenses is disqualified from holding public office under Article 5, Section 9, of the Arkansas Constitution.’ State v. Oldner, 361 Ark. 316, 206 S.W.3d 818 (2005). However, while the Court has expounded on what constitutes an ‘infamous crime’, such as when it spoke of an offense ‘indicative of great moral turpitude’, State v. Irby, 190 Ark. 786, 81 S.W.2d 419 (1935), it has not until very recently attempted to define the term.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      In 2005, the Supreme Court determined that, aside from the specifically named crimes in Article 5, § 9, an ‘infamous crime’ involved dishonesty. Oldner, 361 Ark. at 327, 206 S.W.3d at 822. In 2010, the Supreme Court specifically held that theft constituted an ‘infamous crime’. Edwards v. Campbell, 2010 Ark. 398, 370 S.W.3d 250 (2010). This, however, is as specific as the Supreme Court has gotten, as it further noted that ‘a crime is not considered infamous based on the available punishment but rather is considered infamous based on the underlying nature of that crime.’ Id.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      Because of the uncertainty associated with the term ‘infamous crime’, and in the interests of educating the general public and potential office holders about who is or is not eligible to hold public office in this state, it is the intent of the General Assembly to define the term ‘infamous crime’ for the purpose of assisting the judiciary in its further definitional refinements.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2013, No. 724, § 2, provided: “Legislative findings.
     </p>
<p>
      “The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Article 5, § 9, of the Constitution of the State of Arkansas states that ‘[n]o person hereafter convicted of embezzlement of public money, bribery, forgery or other infamous crime, shall be eligible to the General Assembly or capable of holding any office of trust or profit in this State';
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      A definition of ‘infamous crime' should also encompass those criminal offenses that lead to a loss of public confidence as well as offenses in the nature of perjury or subornation of perjury, false statement, criminal fraud, embezzlement, false pretense, or any other offense that involves some element of deceitfulness, untruthfulness, or falsification; and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      A reviewing court should also measure certain variables when determining what constitutes an ‘infamous crime', such as the attendant mental state of the offense, the particular circumstances surrounding the charged offense, the age and education of the person committing the offense, and, if the offense occurred before the person has assumed public office, the age of the person at the time of the conviction itself.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2017, No. 787, § 3, as amended by Acts 2019, No. 222, § 1, provided: “Applicability. A candidate running for election to any public office who possesses or creates a campaign sign, campaign literature, or other printed campaign material that does not comply with this act is exempt from compliance with this act if the campaign sign, campaign literature, or other printed campaign material was created before the effective date of this act”.
     </p>
<p>
      It is unclear when the exemption described in Acts 2019, No. 222 takes effect. The Uncodified Section 3 of Acts 2017, No. 787, which is being amended by Act 222, was in effect August 2017.

   Deadlines for filing seven percent petitions previously required by this section and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c07s7-7-203" target="_self">7-7-203</a></cite> were unconstitutional as the petition provisions were too vague and indefinite to be enforced, and to judicially supply the needed definiteness would have improperly involved the court in exercising legislative prerogatives.

<p>
       Definition of “political party” in this section, which decertified for ballot access purposes political parties that failed to obtain 3% of the vote in gubernatorial and presidential races, did not impose a severe burden on a political organization's First Amendment associational rights; the organization was free to nominate and endorse candidates of its choice, convey its message to voters, and determine its own structure, and Arkansas provided many alternative paths to the ballot. The state's regulatory interests in preventing ballot overcrowding, frivolous candidacies, and voter confusion justified the decertification requirement.

       The Secretary of State, as the chief elections official for the State of Arkansas, is empowered by this section with the exclusive authority to recognize the formation of new political parties; however, this also means that the former definition of “political party” in this section permitted the Secretary of State to exercise unbridled and unreviewable discretion in her determination of the sufficiency of a new political party petition.

<p>
       Because the presidential candidate for the Independent Party of Arkansas (IPA) garnered 10.43% of the votes in Arkansas's 1992 November General Election, the IPA was a qualified political party under the definition of “political party” in this section. Lewis v. West, 318 Ark. 334, 885 S.W.2d 663 (1994).
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   State official's motion for summary judgment was granted because a statutory scheme like Arkansas's that discriminated between parties with substantial community support and those without it, based on election performance and a viable petition option, was neither unreasonable nor invidiously discriminatory. The definition of “political party” in this section, as tempered by §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c07s7-7-205" target="_self">7-7-205</a></cite>, was reasonable, not invidiously discriminatory, and justified by Arkansas's important regulatory interests in being a good steward of its elections.

<b>
        Vacancy in Nomination.
       </b>
</h4>
<p>
       Subdivision (25) [now (37)] of this section only defines the term “vacancy in nomination” — it in no way empowers political committees with a procedure to cause or create a vacancy. Ivy v. Republican Party, 318 Ark. 50, 883 S.W.2d 805 (1994).
      </p>
<p>
       The General Assembly has provided no procedure for state and county party committees or conventions to make a judicial determination concerning whether a party nominee should be certified; to do so means the party officials would investigate, make factual determinations and determine whether those factual findings constitute “other good and legal cause” under subdivision (25) [now (37)] of this section, an undertaking which requires a judicial tribunal, not a political one. Ivy v. Republican Party, 318 Ark. 50, 883 S.W.2d 805 (1994).
      </p>
<p>
       Because the reason (good and legal cause) for vacating a nomination is defined by state law, it is compelling that a judicial, rather than a political, determination be made as to whether the facts correctly invoke subdivision (25) [now (37)] of this section and its definitional standard. Ivy v. Republican Party, 318 Ark. 50, 883 S.W.2d 805 (1994).
      </p>

   A prosecuting attorney investigating a suspected election law violation was not allowed to subpoena the bank records of a political party's checking account and thereby ascertain the identity of all contributors to the party's campaign and amounts of their contributions without a showing that the information was reasonably relevant to the investigation or that public interest in the disclosure of the information was sufficiently cogent and compelling to outweigh the legitimate and constitutionally protected interests of the political party and its contributors in keeping that information private.

       Former law outlawing the Communist Party was constitutional against contention that it denied the right of suffrage to a person or group of persons and denied them their right of freedom of the speech and freedom of the press.

</h4>
<p>
       Under former law outlawing the Communist Party and imposing the duty upon the Secretary of State to determine whether a political party advocated the overthrow of the government by force or violence or carried on a program of sedition or treason, the discretion of the Secretary of State was subject to control by the courts if exercised arbitrarily and without information to justify his act. Field v. Hall, 201 Ark. 77, 143 S.W.2d 567 (1940) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
<p>
       Reviewing court could not say, as a matter of law, that the Secretary of State acted arbitrarily or abused his discretion in refusing to place the names of nominees of the Communist Party on the ballot without giving them a trial. Field v. Hall, 201 Ark. 77, 143 S.W.2d 567 (1940) (decision under prior law).

<p>
       In mandamus proceeding to compel Secretary of State to accept the certificates of nomination of the nominees of the Communist Party of Arkansas, evidence that it had adopted the constitution of the Communist Party of the United States which supported revolutionary movement against existing social and political order was sufficient to sustain finding that the party advocated the overthrow of local, state or national government. Field v. Hall, 201 Ark. 77, 143 S.W.2d 567 (1940) (decision under prior law).

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the present per diem prescribed by law for the county board of election commissioners was established in 1969 and there has been some difference of opinion concerning whether the per diem prescribed in Section 7 of Article 5 of Act 465 of 1969 was intended as a fixed per diem or merely a minimum per diem to be paid members of the county board of election commissioners; that it is the purpose of this act to permit the increase of the per diem prescribed by law for members of the county board of election commissioners and to ratify and confirm the payment of a per diem in excess of fifteen dollars ($15.00) per day to county boards of election commissioners prior to the effective date of this act, and that this act should be given effect immediately to accomplish this purpose.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that by law the county chairman of the county committee of the majority party and the minority party are members of the county board of election commissioners; that in some instances these persons are also elected officials; that it constitutes at least the appearance of a conflict of interest for the county chairmen, when also elected officials, to serve on the county board of election commissioners; that this Act will prohibit them from serving and therefore avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest; and that until this Act becomes effective the possibility of the conflict of interest will continue.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that present law does not allow a member of the County Board of Election Commissioners to fill a vacancy in an elective office without vacating his seat on the commission; that such law is inequitable and denies the citizens of this state the service of highly qualified people; that this act corrects the inequity; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to allow the citizens the service of qualified people who are otherwise unable to serve.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1995.”

<p>
      Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer [sic], it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

<p>
      Acts 2001, No. 1174, § 2: Mar. 29, 2001. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly that four of the terms will expire prior to the implementation of this act and as a result the State Board of Election Commissioners will lose a majority of its current membership, resulting in a loss of continuity and experience. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2019, No. 376, § 14: Mar. 8, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act amends the process for circulating initiative petitions and referendum petitions; and that the provisions of this act should become effective immediately so that its provisions apply to all petitions circulated after the passage of the act to avoid confusion in petition circulation. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”. The emergency clause for Acts 2019, No. 376 was held to be defective in Safe Surgery Ark. v. Thurston, 2019 Ark. 403.

       Emergency clause of Acts 2019, No. 376 was defective where the stated basis was “to avoid confusion in petition circulation”; Act 376 added additional requirements for getting a referendum on the election ballot, and the prospect of affording those who seek to file a ballot petition additional notice of new requirements for that petition, especially when the people would not be voting on any such initiatives or referenda for at least another 15 months, did not amount to an emergency under Ark.

       The position of county election commissioners being a public office with a fixed term, and there being no power of removal conferred by statute, the State Board of Election Commissioners had no authority to remove county election commissioners after their appointment and qualification.

       The proper legal proceeding to challenge eligibility of a candidate and seek his removal is by writ of mandamus coupled with a declaratory judgment action; the same rings true to disqualify a person who is serving as an election commissioner under this section.

</p><p>
   Due to the United States Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Jones v. Conway County, Arkansas, 143 F.3d 417 (8th Cir. 1998), the status of county election commissioners as either county officials or state officials has become unclear. Because of this lack of clarity, there has been much confusion as to whether or not county election commissioners should have been or currently are immune from suit under the state's policy of tort immunity. It is the intent of the General Assembly to clarify the official status of county election commissioners. Prior to July 30, 1999, county election commissioners were state officials and, as such, were immune from suit pursuant to Arkansas Constitution, Article 5, § 20, and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.19.html#t19c10s19-10-305" target="_blank">19-10-305</a></cite>. Upon July 30, 1999, county election commissioners are hereby deemed to be county officials and are immune from suit pursuant to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.21.html#t21c09s21-9-301" target="_blank">21-9-301</a></cite>.

        Lack of Formal Order.
       </b>
</h4>
<p>
       Where the challenged election precinct had existed in fact through at least three elections, its boundaries had not been questioned by anyone, and it had been recognized by the election officials and voters as a valid precinct, the lack of a formal order approving the creation of the new precinct was a mere technicality, and the precinct was a valid legal precinct. Goodall v. Adams, 277 Ark. 261, 640 S.W.2d 803 (1982).
      </p>
<p>
       Because the complainants did not seek to remedy a precinct boundary problem until after the election, the requirement of filing an order describing precinct's boundaries became directory, not mandatory. Spires v. Compton, 310 Ark. 431, 837 S.W.2d 459 (1992).

<h4 id="t07c05s7-5-101-SchoolDistricts.">
<b>
        School Districts.
       </b>
</h4>
<p>
       School districts being political townships for the purpose of school elections, general election law governed conduct of such elections and required the county board of election commissioners to lay out and designate the voting precincts in the school districts. Christenson v. Felton, 226 Ark. 985, 295 S.W.2d 361 (1956) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
<p>
       The designation of voting precincts in a school district election, mandatory before election, became directory after the election so that voters otherwise qualified would not be disfranchised by failure of the election commissioners to perform their duties and so that votes of such voters would be counted. Christenson v. Felton, 226 Ark. 985, 295 S.W.2d 361 (1956) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
<p>
       Although as a general rule a voter must vote in the ward or precinct in which he resides, votes of otherwise qualified voters in a school district election in which the election commissioners failed to designate voting precincts are not void because cast in the wrong precinct for in the absence of designated precincts there could be no showing of voting in the wrong precincts. Christenson v. Felton, 226 Ark. 985, 295 S.W.2d 361 (1956) (decision under prior law).

       Publisher's Notes.
      </b>
      Acts 1969, No. 465, Art. 7, § 7, originally required that to be qualified to vote a person was to have been a resident of the state for one year, of the county for six months, and of the precinct for thirty days. The one year and the six months requirements were held unconstitutional in Smith v. Climer, 341 F. Supp. 123 (1972), and the thirty-day requirement was held unconstitutional in Meyers v. Jackson, 390 F. Supp 37 (1975). Acts 1987, No. 248 removed the statutory residency requirements.

       Amendments.
      </b>
      The 2007 amendment deleted the second sentence in (a).
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The 2013 amendment inserted (d) and redesignated former (d) as (e); substituted “(e)(1)” for “(d)(1)” twice in (e)(2); added “Act, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1973</cite>ff et seq.” at the end of (e)(2)(B); and added “<cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1973</cite>ee et seq.” at the end of (e)(2)(C).
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The 2017 amendment substituted “Present verification of voter registration” for “Present proof of identity” in (d)(1)(A); substituted “verification of voter registration” for “a copy of a current and valid photo identification or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter” in the introductory language of (d)(1)(B); rewrote (d)(1)(B)(i); substituted “United States Merchant Marine” for “merchant marine” twice in (d)(1)(A)(ii); substituted “present verification of voter registration” for “provide proof of identity” in (d)(2)(A) and (d)(2)(B); substituted “A person” for “Any person” in the introductory language of (e)(1); inserted present (e)(2) and redesignated former (e)(2) as (e)(3); substituted “<cite class="us_code">52 U.S.C. § 20301</cite> et seq.” for “<cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1973</cite>ff et seq.” in (e)(3)(B); substituted “<cite class="us_code">52 U.S.C. § 20101</cite> et seq.” for “<cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1973</cite>ee et seq.” in (e)(3)(C); and made a stylistic change.

<p>
       The requirements of one year's residence in state and at least six months' residence in the county which formerly appeared in this section were violative of the U.S. Const., Amend. 14, were unconstitutional and could not be enforced. Smith v. Climer, 341 F. Supp. 123 (E.D. Ark. 1972).
      </p>
<p>
       The 30-day precinct residency requirement which formerly appeared in this section was unconstitutionally discriminatory in that it did not promote any compelling state interest, unreasonably restricted the right of suffrage and was overbroad. Meyers v. Jackson, 390 F. Supp. 37 (E.D. Ark. 1975).
      </p>
<p>
       Proof-of-identity requirement formerly set forth in subdivision (d)(1)(A) of this section was unconstitutional on its face as it imposed a requirement that fell outside the ambit of Ark. Const. art. 3, § 1.

<p>
       Where named voters in the instant case did not vote in person for the first time, but registered by mail to vote by absentee ballot and voted by absentee ballot for the first time, that practice was in clear violation of former subdivision (d)(1) and the trial court did not err in ruling that their ballots were disqualified and that their votes would not count in the subsequent runoff election. Tate-Smith v. Cupples, 355 Ark. 230, 134 S.W.3d 535 (2003) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
<p>
       Under the separation of powers doctrine, the State Board of Election Commissioners lacked authority to establish a procedure for absentee voters where the General Assembly had provided a method by which an in-person voter could have cured any failure to provide proof of identity, did not provide a similar method for absentee voters, and although the Board had authority to promulgate rules to assure fair and orderly election procedures, it lacked authority to create election procedures.

<p>
       Circuit court did not clearly err in determining that an appointed district court judge was a qualified elector of a specific district, thereby qualifying her as a candidate for a position on the Court of Appeals; Ark. Const. Amend. 80, § 16(D) simply requires that justices and judges be qualified electors within the geographical area from which they are chosen and does not contemplate a distinction between “residence” and “domicile”. The appointed judge had established her physical presence in the district by purchasing a home, registering to vote, and assessing personal property there (even though she still owned another home outside the district).

       Appeal by an inmate in an election-related matter was moot because an election had already been held, and the deadlines for placing the inmate's name on the ballot and for registering to vote had already passed; the issue was not capable of repetition, yet evading review, since the inmate did not indicate that he intended to run for President of the United States again in 2016 or later, there was nothing to suggest that, were he to run again, he would have been subjected to the same action, and there were adequate procedures in place for accelerated consideration of election matters. Moreover, there was no substantial public interest shown.

       7-5-204. Certification of measures and questions submitted to voters.
      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      Whenever a proposed amendment to the Arkansas Constitution or other measure or question is to be submitted to a vote of the people, the Secretary of State shall not certify the amendment, measure, or question to the county board of election commissioners of each county in the state less than seventy-five (75) days before each general election day.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The county board of election commissioners shall include the amendment, measure, or question in the posting that it is required to make under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c05s7-5-206" target="_self">7-5-206</a></cite>.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)If the Secretary of State has not determined the sufficiency of a petition for an amendment or a measure by the seventy-fifth day before the general election or if an amendment or a measure has been challenged for any reason in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Secretary of State shall nonetheless transmit the amendment or measure and the ballot title of each amendment and measure to the county election commissions to make any required posting and to place the amendment or measure on the ballot.
     </p>
<p>
      If the petition for the amendment or measure is subsequently declared insufficient by the Secretary of State or a court of competent jurisdiction or if held to be invalid for any other reason, no votes regarding the amendment or measure shall be counted or certified.
     </p>
<p>

Ivy v. Republican Party, 318 Ark. 50, 883 S.W.2d 805 (1994).
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The General Assembly has provided no procedure for state and county party committees or conventions to make a judicial determination concerning whether a party nominee should be certified; to do so means the party officials would investigate, make factual determinations and determine whether those factual findings constitute “other good and legal cause” under former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c01s7-1-101ol14" target="_self">7-1-101(4)</a></cite>, an undertaking which requires a judicial tribunal, not a political one. Ivy v. Republican Party, 318 Ark. 50, 883 S.W.2d 805 (1994).

<p>
       Statutory right to challenge the eligibility of a candidate before the election is provided by this section; however, this statutory procedure only allows pre-election challenges to a candidate's eligibility. Pederson v. Stracener, 354 Ark. 716, 128 S.W.3d 818 (2003).
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   Candidate's post-election challenge to a state senate runoff election was properly brought within the circuit or district in which alleged voter fraud occurred; further, the Secretary of State and the state democratic committee were not indispensable parties for complete relief under Ark. R. Civ. P. 19 because the office of state senator was not a “state office” as that term had been differentiated in §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c07s7-7-401" target="_self">7-7-401</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c05s7-5-804" target="_self">7-5-804</a></cite>, and Ark.

       Because a candidate did not comply with Ark. R. Civ. P. 78(d) and Ark. Sup. Ct. &amp; Ct. App. R. 6-1(b) in contesting a declaration that the candidate was ineligible to hold office under subsection (b) of this section, the lapse of time and the fact that the election had already been held rendered moot the issues presented on appeal.
   Fite v. Grulkey, 2011 Ark. 188 (2011).
      </p>
<p>
       Issue raised by appellant regarding appellee's eligibility as a candidate in a mayoral election under subsection (b) of this section was moot because the record demonstrated that the election was held. Appellant failed to address the mootness doctrine and whether the exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied to this case.

       Former section permitted assistance to be given to a voter who could not operate a voting machine and allowed assistance to be given to a voter who wished to vote for a write-in candidate but was unable to do so without assistance. Smith v. Arkansas, 385 F. Supp. 703 (E.D. Ark. 1974).

<p>
       Former provision was constitutional that required write-in candidate to be written on the ballot in the handwriting of the person casting the vote; when properly interpreted, the provision applied only to those who could handwrite and where persons with disabilities were concerned, the handwriting requirement had to be construed as including handwriting of person assisting the voter.

<p>
       An elector who gives as his reason for voting by absentee ballot the words “out of town” is in substantial compliance with the law as he would obviously be unavoidably absent from his voting precinct. Lehigh v. Wooley, 240 Ark. 976, 403 S.W.2d 79 (1966) (decision under prior law).

       Evidence sufficient to show unavoidable absence warranting vote by absentee ballot. Simonetti v. Brick, 266 Ark. 551, 587 S.W.2d 16 (1979).

       It is not essential that the voter give more than the primary reason he will be unavoidably absent from his voting place. Forrest v. Baker, 287 Ark. 239, 698 S.W.2d 497 (1985).
      </p>
<p>
       “Unable to get to poll,” “work,” “my age, I cannot get there,” “will not be able to get to the poll before 6:30,” “my husband doesn't get home from work in time,” and “sickness in the family” are all valid reasons given on the absentee ballot application, when there is no allegation that any of the applications are false or that any of the voters can get to their polling places. Forrest v. Baker, 287 Ark. 239, 698 S.W.2d 497 (1985).
      </p>
<p>
       The court properly invalidated the ballots of 495 absentee voters for failure to indicate on their absentee-ballot applications a statutory reason for voting absentee. Womack v. Foster, 340 Ark. 124, 8 S.W.3d 854 (2000).

       Circuit court abused its discretion in ruling that the claimant was attempting to amend his complaint with a new cause of action by offering proof of absentee-ballot irregularities under the miscellaneous other category in the claimant's exhibit, because the claimant was perfectly within his rights to make his allegations of absentee-ballot irregularities for nursing home residents, in particular, more definite and certain by offering proof of those violations. The claimant alleged a valid cause of action and set out a prima facie case with sufficient facts to give reasonable information as to the grounds of the contest, and he proffered absentee applications and voter statements to show why and how the ballots were illegal.

   Pursuant to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.01.html#t01c02s1-2-207" target="_blank">1-2-207</a></cite>, this section is set out above as amended by Acts 2003, No. 994. This section was also amended by Acts 2003, No. 131, § 2, to read as follows:
     </p>
<p>
      “Vote certification — Report. (a) At the time that the county board of election commissioners certifies the vote to the Secretary of State, the county board shall report to the State Board of Election Commissioners the total number of: (1) Ballots cast; (2) Ballots printed and delivered to the polls; (3) Challenged ballots that were disqualified; (4) Spoiled ballots; and (5) Unused ballots.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      Within thirty (30) calendar days after any election, the county board shall report to the state board the number of over-votes and under-votes cast in the election.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(c)(1)
      </b>
      Certified results for each polling place shall be entered and transmitted to the Secretary of State through the Internet website interface provided by the Secretary of State for all state and federal elections.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      If it is not possible for the county board to transmit the results via the Internet website interface, then the county board may transmit the results by facsimile transmission.”
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       Amendments.
      </b>
      The 2009 amendment inserted (b)(10) and made related changes; and substituted “a statement ... county election commissioner” for “an affidavit, under the signature of all three (3) commissioners or individually, with the state board in a form approved by the state board to the effect that all duties and responsibilities of the county election commissioner have been complied with” in (e).
     </p>
<p>
      The 2011 amendment rewrote (b) and deleted former (c) through (e).
     </p>
<p>
      The 2013 amendment by No. 1058, in (a), substituted “precinct to the Secretary of State through the election night reporting interface provided by the Secretary of State” for “polling place to the county clerk, who shall immediately transmit the results to the Secretary of State through the Internet website interface provided by the Secretary of State”; inserted (b) and redesignated former (b) as (c).
     </p>
<p>
      The 2013 amendment by No. 1126 deleted “Internet” following “State through the” in (a).

     </p>
<p>
      The action shall be brought in the circuit court of the county in which the certification of nomination or certificate of vote is made when a county or city or township office, including the office of county delegate or county committee member, is involved, and except as provided in this subchapter, within any county in the circuit or district wherein any of the wrongful acts occurred when any circuit or district office is involved, and except as provided in this subchapter, in the Pulaski County Circuit Court when the office of United States Senator or any state office is involved.

       This section provides a right of action to contest the certification of the nomination or the certificate of vote after an election; thus, the 20-day period for such an action is not applicable to an action brought before a primary election to determine the eligibility of a candidate.

<p>
       Voter's filing of election contest in Pulaski County was in error as jurisdiction under subsection (b) of this section was in Phillips County, as that was the county of District 16 where wrongful acts were alleged to have occurred; there was no jurisdiction under the statute to hear a post-election contest in Pulaski County.

<p>
       In an election contest, the circuit court erred in dismissing a complaint by a candidate for failure to join the Secretary of State as a party; the complaint was properly filed in the correct county and was timely filed, timely served, and timely answered by the electoral winner; although the specific procedure was provided by this section, it did not supplant the rules of civil procedure.

      </p>
<p>
       Appellee candidate's petition for writ of mandamus and declaratory judgment, which sought to have appellant candidate declared ineligible, was dismissed because (1) appellee filed the petition postelection rather than preelection, (2) the petition did not institute a postelection contest under this section because appellee alleged a right to a postelection challenge of appellant's eligibility, and the parties stipulated that appellant obtained the most votes; and (3) a circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear a postelection challenge to eligibility, and the remedy for usurpation of office lay with the state under quo warranto.

   School district residents attempted to state a cause of action in illegal exaction, Ark. Const., Art. 16, § 13, and the circuit court erred in finding that they alleged a cause of action contesting the school district election, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.06.html#t06c14s6-14-116" target="_blank">6-14-116</a></cite>; the circuit court had to determine whether the residents had stated a cause of action in illegal exaction on remand.

</p><p>
   Petition of candidate, who brought a preelection attack on the eligibility of a competing Court of Appeals candidate, was compliant with Arkansas law despite lacking an affidavit. This section is a postelection procedure; preelection attacks are governed by §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c05s7-5-207ol1b" target="_self">7-5-207(b)</a></cite>, and that section does not have a verification requirement.

       Circuit court abused its discretion in ruling that the claimant was attempting to amend his complaint with a new cause of action by offering proof of absentee-ballot irregularities under the miscellaneous other category in the claimant's exhibit, because the claimant was perfectly within his rights to make his allegations of absentee-ballot irregularities for nursing home residents, in particular, more definite and certain by offering proof of those violations. The claimant alleged a valid cause of action and set out a prima facie case with sufficient facts to give reasonable information as to the grounds of the contest, and he proffered absentee applications and voter statements to show why and how the ballots were illegal.

       A duly qualified candidate for a municipal office can properly contest an election, where under the facts, although he cannot honestly allege that he received a sufficient number of votes to entitle him to certificate of nomination, he can allege that when the election returns are purged of the enumerated illegal votes it will be shown that such candidate should be certified as a candidate in the run-off or general primary election.

      In the event that there are more election contests brought under this section than the circuit court judge can dispose of prior to ten (10) days before any election to be held, either of the parties to the contest may so report to the circuit judge in vacation or otherwise, who shall have full and complete authority to appoint an attorney with the qualifications of circuit judge to hear any contest and render a final judgment in such contest.

In the event that the first two (2) committee members do not agree within five (5) days on the third member, then the third member shall be chosen by lot from the respective choices of the two committee members.

<p>
      All proceedings shall be conducted as in the case of any regular judge trying any such case, including the right of appeal. The judge so appointed shall have full power and authority in the trial of election contests in all respects as are now conferred by the Arkansas Constitution upon circuit judges in this state. The judgment rendered by the attorney so appointed shall be binding with full force and effect as if the regular circuit judge had heard the cause.
     </p>
<p>
      In the appointment of the attorney, the circuit judge shall not be confined in the selection of the attorney to the judicial circuit in which the contest is pending. However, the hearing of the contest shall be had in the county in which the contest has been filed.

     </p>
<p>
      The stay of the suspension shall continue until the appeal is complete or until the House of Representatives takes final action on the conviction.

<p>
      For eligibility contests for the House of Representatives pursuant to Arkansas Constitution, Article 5, § 9, a complaint shall be filed at any time after the election of the individual to a seat in the House of Representatives. For action for expulsion from the House of Representatives pursuant to Arkansas Constitution, Article 5, § 12, the complaint shall be filed at any time permitted by law. A responsive pleading shall be filed within twenty (20) days after receipt of the complaint unless an earlier or later date is set by the commission for good cause shown.

       7-5-807. Election illegalities — Complaint — Grand jury investigation — Indictment — Trial.
      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      If ten (10) reputable citizens of any county shall file a complaint with the circuit judge within twenty (20) days after any election alleging that illegal or fraudulent votes were cast, that fraudulent returns or certifications were made, or that the Political Practices Act was violated, the circuit judge, if in his or her opinion there is good ground to believe the charges to be true, shall convene a special term at once unless the regular term is in session or will convene within thirty (30) days.
     </p>
<p>
      If the charges come in a regular term, the judge shall specially charge the grand jury as to them.
     </p>
<p>
      Should a special term be called, it shall in all respects be as if convened by law. The circuit judge shall cause to be summoned grand and petit jurors, either on lists selected by the sheriff or by disinterested persons selected by him or her for that purpose, according to his or her opinion as to the best method to select unbiased jurors.
     </p>
<p>
      Should indictments be returned, either at a special or regular term, for violating the general, primary, or special election laws, the defendants shall be given a speedy trial at the term, and the court may adjourn terms of other courts in order that they may be tried, unless for good cause shown or in the interests of justice a continuance or change of venue is granted. No change of venue shall be granted in such cases except after a hearing and a finding by the court that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in the district of the county where the indictment is pending.

       The purpose of former law for determining guilt after an election and providing for ouster from office was to prevent one illegally nominated from holding the office, but not to entitle the contestant to the office. Cain v. CarlLee, 169 Ark. 887, 277 S.W. 551 (1925) (decision under prior law).

<p>
       If either party to a primary contest is placed on the ticket and elected, and later it is determined that he was not entitled to the nomination, the judgment should operate as an ouster, in which case there would be a vacancy to be filled according to law. Robinson v. Knowlton, 183 Ark. 1127, 40 S.W.2d 450 (1931); Parish v. Nelson, 186 Ark. 786, 55 S.W.2d 922 (1933) (decisions under prior law).

<p>
       The general time frame for appeals, i.e., 30 days, did not trump the seven-day time limit set out in the statute because the statutory rule was based on a fixed public policy which had been legislatively adopted and had as its basis something other than court administration.

      Acts 1969, No. 465, Art. 13, § 10: approved Apr. 17, 1969. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and declared by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the present election laws are ancient and outdated in part and have caused and are causing much confusion and controversy, that there are particular problem areas in the present law which need immediate legislation in order to resolve same, that elections are and will continue to be held and conducted in this atmosphere of confusion and controversy until these problem areas are resolved and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act shall be in force and effect from and after its passage.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 1970 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 27, § 3: approved Mar. 13, 1970. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and declared by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the new election code contains no provision for the filing of political practice pledges for certain candidates; that it is necessary that all candidates file such pledge; that elections are and will continue to be held and conducted while this conflict exists and this act is necessary to protect peace, health, safety and welfare and, therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 1972 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 37, § 6: Feb. 16, 1972. Emergency clause provided: “The General Assembly finds that the dates of the 1972 national nominating conventions and primary elections are fast approaching, that the people of the state are in immediate need of a resolution of uncertainties that have arisen with respect to the selection of delegates and alternates thereto, and that the effective administration of the election laws of this state requires that the dates of the primary elections now fixed by law be advanced. Accordingly, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act, being necessary for the preservation of the public health, interest, safety, and welfare, shall be effective immediately upon its passage and approval.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 1972 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 42, § 5: Feb. 18, 1972. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas the great majority of municipalities elect their municipal officials as independents and do not have political primaries for municipal office and whereas the great majority of municipal officials in small towns and cities receive no compensation or very nominal compensation and it would result in a real hardship to force candidates for municipal office in these small towns and cities to run in primaries and to file for municipal office seven (7) months before the general election and nine (9) months before the taking of office on January 1; and this act is immediately necessary to correct this situation. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall take effect immediately on its passage and approval.”

       Because the reference in subsection (d) is to a “certificate of expunction” from Arkansas or another state, a federal certificate may be regarded as the equivalent of such a document. Tyler v. Shackleford, 303 Ark. 662, 799 S.W.2d 789 (1990).

   The setting aside of the conviction of a youthful offender under former <cite class="us_code">18 U.S.C. § 5201(b)</cite> meant that it were as if the conviction had never been, and a judge who had had a conviction set aside was never obligated under this section to produce his federal Certificate of Vacation of Conviction with his political practices pledges because, legally, his conviction never occurred and the documentation was “a ministerial act” that simply certified what had already been accomplished.

State for use and benefit of Independence County v. Baker, 197 Ark. 1075, 126 S.W.2d 937 (1939) (decision under prior law).

       Candidates for board of directors or municipal judge in cities operating under the city manager form of government are not required to file a political practice pledge as provided in this section. Williams v. Pulaski County Election Comm'n, 249 Ark. 309, 459 S.W.2d 52 (1970).

   Although, contrary to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c10s7-10-103" target="_self">7-10-103</a></cite>, an appointed district court judge who had filed as a candidate for the Court of Appeals erroneously used the title “Judge” in her signature of the political practices pledge, section<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c10s7-10-103" target="_self">7-10-103</a></cite> did not restrict courts from ordering a change on the ballot and curent law only sanctioned those who did not sign the pledge; there was no penalty for those found to have included inaccurate information on the pledge.

        Independent Candidates.
       </b>
</h4>
<p>
       The concept of “independent candidates” does not include candidates for board of directors or municipal judge in a city having a city manager form of government, since all such candidates run without political affiliation. Williams v. Pulaski County Election Comm'n, 249 Ark. 309, 459 S.W.2d 52 (1970).
      </p>
<h4 id="t07c06s7-6-102-SubstantialCompliance.">
<b>
        Substantial Compliance.
       </b>
</h4>
<p>
       A candidate's pledge that he was familiar with former corrupt practices laws, without more, was substantial compliance with former similar statute especially where it was not contended that the corrupt practices laws had been violated. Taaffe v. Sanderson, 173 Ark. 970, 294 S.W. 74 (1927) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
<p>
       Where a candidate for state senator, in good faith, intended to comply with prior law, and by mistake filed his pledge with the secretary of the Democratic Central Committee instead of with the Secretary of State, he should not be denied the right to have his name placed on the ticket. Spence v. Whittaker, 178 Ark. 51, 9 S.W.2d 769 (1928) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
<h4 id="t07c06s7-6-102-Surname.">
<b>
        Surname.
       </b>
</h4>
<p>
       Appointed district court judge who had filed as a candidate for the Court of Appeals was not disqualified because she used her maiden surname on the political practices pledge rather than her married surname. The record indicated that the candidate was known professionally by her maiden name, and her use of her maiden name on the ballot title did not serve to undermine the spirit of the political practices pledge by obfuscating her true identity, nor did it run afoul of this section, which requires only that a candidate use their “surname”.
   Barrett v. Thurston, 2020 Ark. 36 (2020).
      </p>
<h4 id="t07c06s7-6-102-TimeofFiling.">
<b>
        Time of Filing.
       </b>
</h4>
<p>
       Although the filing of the pledge was only two days late and might have been considered a substantial compliance with former similar statute if no objection had been raised until after the election, where enforcement of the provisions of the law was sought before the election, the provision in the law as to the time for filing was considered mandatory. Wright v. Sullivan, 229 Ark. 378, 314 S.W.2d 700 (1958) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
<p>
       This section is mandatory and not directory where enforcement is sought before the election, and it was error for the trial court to direct the commissioners to place on the general election ballots the names of candidates who filed their political practices pledges after the filing deadline. Stillinger v. Rector, 253 Ark. 982, 490 S.W.2d 109 (1973).
      </p>
<p>
       Failure to timely file a political practice pledge with the Secretary of State as required by subdivision (e)(2)(B) of this section is reason enough to prevent a candidate's name from appearing on the ballot. Lewis v. West, 318 Ark. 334, 885 S.W.2d 663 (1994).

       A heavier burden on the rights, under U.S. Const., Amend. 1, of approved political action committees (PACs), than on the rights of small donor PACs, is justified by the state's compelling interest in avoiding actual or apparent corruption. Russell v. Burris, 978 F. Supp. 1211 (E.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 146 F.3d 563 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Limit of $200 on contributions to approved political action committees has not prevented political committees from amassing the necessary resources for effective advocacy, and does not appreciably infringe on their rights to free speech and association. Russell v. Burris, 978 F. Supp. 1211 (E.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 146 F.3d 563 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Substantial disparity between small donor political action committees' (PACs) and approved PACs' abilities to raise money and contribute to candidates is balanced by the facts small donor PACs may only receive contributions from individuals, and approved PACs are not limited in the amount they can contribute overall; this disparity does not violate the approved PACs equal protection rights. Russell v. Burris, 978 F. Supp. 1211 (E.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 146 F.3d 563 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Whether the $200 limit in subdivision (1) is narrowly tailored to serve the state's interest in preventing corruption held a question of fact; summary judgment on the issue of constitutionality was therefore denied. Ark. Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 983 F. Supp. 1209 (W.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd, 146 F.3d 558 (8th Cir. 1998).

<p>
       Contributions of $1000 to candidates for statewide races are not large, and the state lacks the compelling interest necessary to justify further limiting contributions in statewide races; therefore, $300 limits in former subdivisions (a)(2) and (b)(2) were unconstitutional. Russell v. Burris, 978 F. Supp. 1211 (E.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 146 F.3d 563 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Limitations in former subdivisions (a)(1) and (b)(1) on contributions to candidates in non-statewide races to $100 were not unconstitutionally low (except in races for Supreme Court Justice and Court of Appeals Judge). Russell v. Burris, 978 F. Supp. 1211 (E.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 146 F.3d 563 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Limit of $100 on contributions to Supreme Court Justices and Court of Appeals Judges was unconstitutionally low, because these judges are elected in statewide races, and under Canon 5C(2) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, candidates for these offices may not personally solicit or accept contributions. Russell v. Burris, 978 F. Supp. 1211 (E.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 146 F.3d 563 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Substantial disparity between small donor political action committees' (PACs) and approved PACs' abilities to raise money and contribute to candidates is balanced by the facts small donor PACs may only receive contributions from individuals, and approved PACs are not limited in the amount they can contribute overall; this disparity does not violate the approved PACs equal protection rights. Russell v. Burris, 978 F. Supp. 1211 (E.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 146 F.3d 563 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Whether the $100 limit in former subsection (a) is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest was a question of fact; summary judgment on the issue of constitutionality was therefore denied. Ark. Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 983 F. Supp. 1209 (W.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd, 146 F.3d 558 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Whether the $500 limit in former subsection (k) was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in preventing an exchange of political services from current and potential office holders was a question of fact; summary judgment on the issue of constitutionality was therefore denied. Ark. Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 983 F. Supp. 1209 (W.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd, 146 F.3d 558 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Whether the blackout period in former subsection (g) was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in preventing corruption was a question of fact; summary judgment on the issue of constitutionality was therefore denied. Ark. Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 983 F. Supp. 1209 (W.D. Ark. 1997), aff'd, 146 F.3d 558 (8th Cir. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       The black out period provided for in former subsection (g) was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and, therefore, was unconstitutional. Ark. Right to Life State Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 29 F. Supp. 2d 540 (W.D. Ark. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       The $500 limit on contributions to independent expenditure committees is unconstitutional as a matter of law because it is too low to allow meaningful participation in the political process and, thus, is not narrowly tailored to serve the state's alleged compelling interest. Ark. Right to Life State Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 29 F. Supp. 2d 540 (W.D. Ark. 1998).
      </p>
<p>
       Political activist had standing to assert a First Amendment challenge to the prohibition in this section against soliciting or accepting campaign contributions more than two years before an election; the activist alleged a desire to donate in a future election cycle, submitted an affidavit, and alleged a credible threat of prosecution. A likelihood of success supported a preliminary injunction because no evidence showed restricting early contributions furthered the state's anti-corruption interest more than contribution limits alone.

       The commission has no power whatever to make any orders, much less to enforce them; the only “disciplinary action” it can take under this section is to make public a letter declaring what it has found in the way of a violation.

      The 2013 amendment substituted “Except as provided in subdivision (b)(3)(B)(ii) of this section, all” for “All” in (b)(3)(B)(i); redesignated former (b)(3)(B)(ii) as present (b)(3)(B)(ii)

   The commission has no power whatever to make any orders, much less to enforce them; the only “disciplinary action” it can take under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c06s7-6-217ol1h2" target="_self">7-6-217(h)(2)</a></cite> (now (g)(3)) is to make public a letter declaring what it has found in the way of a violation.

       While the commission may impose fines for violations, it has no power to prosecute under this subchapter; instead, the commission must refer the violations to the “proper law enforcement authorities ” who would then pursue a prosecution.

<p>
       State Attorney, as the government official charged with administering and enforcing Init. Meas. 1996, No. 1, and as the proper law enforcement authority to handle violations of the Act, was properly named as a defendant in action challenging the validity of the Act. Ark. Right to Life State Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 972 F. Supp. 1187 (W.D. Ark. 1997).
      </p>
<p>
       Plaintiffs had standing to pursue a pre-enforcement challenge of Init. Meas. 1996, No. 1 because the Act has been recently enacted, it facially restricted the plaintiffs, and violation of the statute could subject the plaintiffs to criminal prosecution. Ark. Right to Life State Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 972 F. Supp. 1187 (W.D. Ark. 1997).
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   Plaintiffs were not required to subject themselves to either the fine or term of imprisonment found in former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c06s7-6-202" target="_self">7-6-202</a></cite> or the penalties outlined in this section in order to challenge the constitutionality of the new restrictions; it is not required that a party expose herself to arrest or prosecution under a criminal statute in order to challenge the statute in federal court. Ark. Right to Life State Political Action Comm. v. Butler, 972 F. Supp. 1187 (W.D. Ark. 1997).
      </p>
<p>
       Because the Arkansas Ethics Commission investigates campaign-finance violations, levies fines against candidates, and makes referrals to law enforcement, the commissioners had a strong enough connection to a campaign finance law to make them proper defendants in a suit asserting a constitutional challenge.

      Acts 1969, No. 465, Art. 13, § 10: approved Apr. 17, 1969. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and declared by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the present election laws are ancient and outdated in part and have caused and are causing much confusion and controversy, that there are particular problem areas in the present law which need immediate legislation in order to resolve same, that elections are and will continue to be held and conducted in this atmosphere of confusion and controversy until these problem areas are resolved and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act shall be in force and effect from and after its passage.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 1972 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 42, § 5: Feb. 18, 1972. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas the great majority of municipalities elect their municipal officials as independents and do not have political primaries for municipal office and whereas the great majority of municipal officials in small towns and cities receive no compensation or very nominal compensation and it would result in a real hardship to force candidates for municipal office in these small towns and cities to run in primaries and to file for municipal office seven (7) months before the general election and nine (9) months before the taking of office on January 1; and this act is immediately necessary to correct this situation. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall take effect immediately on its passage and approval.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 1977, No. 731, § 3: Mar. 24, 1977. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby determined by the Seventy-First General Assembly that this act is necessary for the continued proper operation of the electoral process in the State of Arkansas, now therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2001, No. 1789, § 12: Emergency clause failed. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly that Amendment 80 to the Arkansas Constitution becomes effective on July 1, 2001; that this implements the nonpartisan election of justices and judges as mandated by Amendment 80; and that to effectively implement Amendment 80, this act should become effective on July 1, 2001. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2001.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2009, No. 1480, § 117: Apr. 10, 2009. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act makes various revisions to Arkansas election laws that are designed to improve the administration of elections and special elections and that these revisions should be implemented as soon as possible so that the citizens of this state may benefit from improved election procedures. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

<p>
      Acts 2011, No. 1185, §
   21: Oct. 2, 2011.
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2014, No. 210, §
   3: Feb. 28, 2014. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the current time allotted for special elections to fill vacancies in certain offices is often rendered impracticable by legal and practical considerations associated with holding a statewide special election. The General Assembly further finds that because statewide special elections cost in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000), the Governor should have the discretion to determine whether special elections to fill certain vacancies are impractical because of the timing of the vacancy and that this act should become effective at the earliest opportunity to allow the state to avoid election expenses that the Governor determines are impractical. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      (1)A person desiring to have his or her name placed upon the ballot as an independent candidate without political party affiliation for any United States office other than President of the United States or Vice President of the United States or state, county, township, or district office in any general election in this state shall file, during the party filing period for the year in which the election is to be held, a political practices pledge, an affidavit of eligibility, and a notice of candidacy stating the name and title the candidate proposes to appear on the ballot and identifying the elective office sought, including the position number, if any.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)An independent candidate shall state the same position, including the position number, if any, on his or her petition.
     </p>
<p>
      When a candidate has identified the position sought on the notice of candidacy, the candidate shall not be allowed to change the position but may withdraw a notice of candidacy and file a new notice of candidacy designating a different position before the deadline for filing.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)(A)The person shall furnish by 12:00 noon on May 1 of the year in which the general election is to be held petitions signed by not less than three percent (3%) of the qualified electors in the county, township, or district in which the person is seeking office, but in no event shall more than two thousand (2,000) signatures be required for a district, county, or township office.
     </p>
<p>
      If the person is a candidate for state office or for United States Senator in which a statewide race is required, the person shall file petitions signed by not less than three percent (3%) of the qualified electors of the state or which contain ten thousand (10,000) signatures of qualified electors, whichever is the lesser.
     </p>
<p>
      Each elector signing the petition shall be a registered voter, and the petition shall be directed to the official with whom the person is required by law to file the petition to qualify as a candidate and shall request that the name of the person be placed on the ballot for election to the office mentioned in the petition.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)A petition shall be on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State that includes without limitation a designated space for:
     </p>
<p>
      The signature of the qualified elector;
     </p>
<p>
      The printed name of the qualified elector;
     </p>
<p>
      The date of the signature of the qualified elector; and
     </p>
<p>
      The address of the qualified elector.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   A petition shall be circulated not earlier than ninety (90) calendar days before the deadline for filing petitions to qualify as an independent candidate unless the number of days is reduced by a proclamation, ordinance, resolution, order, or other authorized document for a special election under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c11s7-11-101" target="_self">7-11-101</a></cite> et seq.
     </p>
<p>
      (i)The person filing for office as an independent candidate shall submit with the petition an affidavit that swears:
     </p>
<p>
      The signatures were not collected for a period over ninety (90) days;
     </p>
<p>
      The beginning and ending dates for collection of signatures on the petition are those as indicated on the affidavit; and
     </p>
<p>
      The affidavit under subdivision (b)(3)(C)(i) of this section shall be on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
     </p>
<p>
      In determining the number of qualified electors in any county, township, or district or in the state, the total number of votes cast therein for all candidates in the preceding general election for the office of Governor shall be conclusive of the number of qualified electors therein for the purposes of this section.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   If the number of days in which the petition for independent candidacy may be circulated is reduced by a proclamation, ordinance, resolution, order, or other authorized document for a special election under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c11s7-11-101" target="_self">7-11-101</a></cite> et seq., the number of signatures required on the petition shall be reduced proportionately.
     </p>
<p>
      Signatures that are incorrectly obtained or submitted under this section shall not be counted.
     </p>

       Amendments.
      </b>
      The 2007 amendment by No. 1020 inserted “12:00 noon on” in (b)(1)(A); and substituted “the petition” for “nomination certificates” in (b)(2).
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The 2007 amendment by No. 1049, in (b), added “unless the number of days is reduced by a proclamation, ordinance, resolution, or order of special election under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c05s7-5-103" target="_self">7-5-103</a></cite>” in (3), and added (5); in (c)(2)(A), substituted “ninety (90)” for “eighty (80)” and “seventy (70)” for “sixty (60)”; and inserted “or she” in (e).

     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The 2009 amendment by No. 1480 rewrote (a); substituted “order, or other authorized document for a special election under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c11s7-11-101" target="_self">7-11-101</a></cite> et seq.” for “or order of special election under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c05s7-5-103" target="_self">7-5-103</a></cite>” or variants in (b)(3) and (b)(5); and deleted (c) through (f).

<p>
       Subsection (e) of this section, even if construed to apply to all petitions filed under the election laws rather than to those specifically mentioned in this section, would violate the constitutional provisions related to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Ark. Const., Art. 7, §§ 4 and 11. American Party v. Brandon, 253 Ark. 123, 484 S.W.2d 881 (1972) (decision prior to 1993 amendment).
      </p>
<p>
       The deadline provision and former 15% requirement of this section, taken together, were overbroad, excessively restricted access of independents to the ballot and were unconstitutional as applied to independent candidates for state, district, county and township offices. Lendall v. Bryant, 387 F. Supp. 397 (E.D. Ark. 1975) (decision prior to 1975 amendment).
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   Former requirement in this section that a person seeking to run as an independent candidate for a state, county, township, or district office file a 15% petition was unconstitutional since reasonably diligent candidates could not be expected to satisfy such a requirement within the period allowed and since such a high percentage was not necessary to protect any compelling state interest. Lendall v. Jernigan, 424 F. Supp. 951 (E.D. Ark.), aff'd, <cite class="us_code">433 U.S. 901</cite>, <cite class="s_court">97 S. Ct. 2963</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">53 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 1086 (1977).
      </p>
<p>
       Deadline provisions in this section are constitutional in view of administrative necessity, the state's interest in excluding frivolous candidates and achieving a manageable ballot and the fact that reasonably diligent candidates could be expected to satisfy the requirements with some regularity. Rock v. Byrant, 459 F. Supp. 64 (E.D. Ark.), aff'd without op., 590 F.2d 340 (8th Cir. 1978).
      </p>
<p>
       State may reasonably require independent candidates seriously seeking statewide office to have concluded their qualifying procedures by the time of the preferential primary, at which the political parties' nominees may be selected. Rock v. Byrant, 459 F. Supp. 64 (E.D. Ark.), aff'd without op., 590 F.2d 340 (8th Cir. 1978).

       To the extent that it fails to provide unrecognized political parties with a meaningful opportunity to participate in special elections, Arkansas' party recognition scheme, as set forth in this section, violates rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution of freedom of speech and association, due process, and equal protection.

   Requirement that a political party obtain signatures of a certain percentage of voters to obtain party certification is not narrowly drawn to serve a compelling state interest and unconstitutionally burdens the associational and equal protection rights of a party and its candidates; the legislature determined in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c07s7-7-103" target="_self">7-7-103</a></cite> that the set number of signatures for independent candidates is sufficient to demonstrate the required modicum of support, and there is no basis for requiring a larger number of signatures for a party.

       Appointed district court judge who had filed as a candidate for the Court of Appeals was not disqualified because she used her maiden surname on the political practices pledge rather than her married surname. The record indicated that the candidate was known professionally by her maiden name, and her use of her maiden name on the ballot title did not serve to undermine the spirit of the political practices pledge by obfuscating her true identity, nor did it run afoul of this section, which requires only that a candidate use their “surname”.

    A.C.R.C. Notes.
   
   The repeal of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c07s7-7-504" target="_self">7-7-504</a></cite> by Acts 1995, No. 901 has been deemed to supersede its amendment by Acts 1995, Nos. 946 and 963. Former §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t07c07s7-7-504" target="_self">7-7-504</a></cite> was amended by identical Acts 1995, Nos. 946 and 963, § 13, effective January 1, 1995, to read as follows:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      In voting machine counties where common polling places are established, the county clerk shall furnish each county committee represented at the polling place one (1) copy of the appropriate precinct voter registration list to determine each person's right to vote in any party primary being conducted at the common polling place.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      Where separate polling places are established, a copy of the appropriate precinct voter registration list shall be delivered to each county committee by the county clerk.”

       A.C.R.C. Notes.
      </b>
      Acts 2013, No. 1413, § 1, provided: “Legislative findings.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Through Amendment 7 to the Arkansas Constitution, the people of Arkansas have reserved to themselves the power to propose legislative measures, laws, and amendments to the Arkansas Constitution and to enact or reject the proposed measures, laws, and amendments at the polls independently of the General Assembly;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The citizens of this state have an expectation that their right of initiative and referendum will be respected and that the process of gathering signatures of registered voters will be free of fraud, forgery, and other illegal conduct by sponsors, canvassers, notaries, and petitioners;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Sponsors and paid canvassers may have an incentive to knowingly submit forged or otherwise invalid signatures in order to obtain additional time to gather signatures and submit supplemental petitions;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      In 2012, sponsors of four (4) separate initiative petitions submitted petitions to the Secretary of State containing over two hundred ninety-eight thousand (298,000) purported signatures of registered voters;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Of the four petitions submitted, none had an initial validity rate in excess of fifty-six percent (56%), and three (3) of the petitions had an initial validity rate below thirty-one percent (31%); and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Of the three petitions with the lowest initial validity rate, there were widespread instances of apparent fraud, forgery, and false statements in the signature-gathering process.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      It is further found and determined by the General Assembly that if an effort is not made to address these issues:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Untrained paid canvassers will continue to obtain and submit forged and otherwise facially invalid signatures; and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Unscrupulous sponsors and canvassers will continue to have an incentive to submit forged and otherwise facially invalid signatures and make false statements to the Secretary of State.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(c)
      </b>
      It is further found and determined by the General Assembly that if this act becomes law:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Sponsors and canvassers of proposed initiative measures will be held more accountable for their actions in gathering signatures from registered voters; and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The earlier determination of the insufficiency of petitions rife with false statements, forged signatures, and otherwise facially invalid signatures will result in less confusion and frustration with the initiative process.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(d)
      </b>
      For the reasons stated in this section, the General Assembly finds that passage of this act will make sponsors and canvassers more accountable to the people of this state, facilitate the initiative process, conserve state resources, and help to restore the confidence and trust of the people in the initiative process.”

     </p>
<p>
      Acts 1933, No. 71, § 3: approved Mar. 3, 1933. Emergency clause provided: “It being necessary for the welfare of the state that in all matters affecting amendments to the Constitution, and the measures to be voted on by the people, there should be definiteness and certainty with reference to the amendment or measure affected, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 1989, No. 280, § 10: Mar. 1, 1989.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this Act, being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
<p>

<p>
      Acts 2013, No. 1413, § 22: Apr. 22, 2013. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that existing procedures for initiating and referring state laws and ordinances pursuant to Amendment 7 to the Arkansas Constitution and state statutes are inadequate to prevent fraudulent practices by sponsors and canvassers in obtaining ballot access; that this act addresses these inadequacies; and that this act is immediately necessary to prevent fraudulent practices because petition campaigns are either being conducted at the present time or may be conducted immediately upon the adjournment of the General Assembly with respect to either initiated or referred measures. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2019, No. 898, § 16: July 1, 2019.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2019”.
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

       Arkansas had a legitimate state interest in making the signing of a ballot petition a crime in certain instances and core political speech was not impeded under this process, notwithstanding the argument that county registrars' voter registration lists should not be definitive evidence that a person is a registered voter because persons may consider themselves registered after completing a registration card but before the application is processed by the county; since the registered voter requirement seeks to exclude those signatures that are falsely obtained or forged and aims to protect the state's initiative process from abuse, this section's regulations of the initiative procedure did not restrict political speech.

       Where the election petitions circulated and signed did not contain the title and full text of the measure actually proposed to the voters at the general election, substantial compliance with the recommended form, including the ballot title and full text, is contemplated under the specific terms of this section, and the ballot title was sufficient because it alleged the general purpose of the act to be referred, and the details of the referred act are not required to be set out in the petition.

      The information provided by the person on the petition may be used as evidence of the validity or invalidity of the signature.

       Under this section it is necessary that a full and correct copy of a referred measure be attached to each referendum petition, but it is not necessary that it be attached to each sheet of a petition. Townsend v. McDonald, 184 Ark. 273, 42 S.W.2d 410 (1931).
      </p>
<p>
       Where the city did not have a local ordinance in place on the subject of attachment of the measure to the referendum petition, the clerk had to look to the statute for guidance; the purpose of attaching a copy of the measure to the petition was to inform the voter of what he or she was signing, regardless of whether the measure was a statewide act or a local ordinance, and asking the voters to sign a petition without an attached copy of the ordinance would defeat the purpose of the statute.

       This section in no way curtails the operation of Ark. Const., Amend. 7, which amended Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 1, but is in aid of that amendment and insures the giving to the signer of the petition as much information as is possible and practicable with regard to what he is being asked to sign.

       Former subdivisions (e)(B)(1)(i) and (ii) were unconstitutional because they purported permit this court to review a decision of the Secretary of State with respect to the ballot title portion of a petition, and the only authority given this court by Ark. Const. Amend. 7, which amended Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 1, is the authority to review the Secretary of State's certification of a “petition” which includes both the ballot title and the signatures.

<p>
       Action of the Attorney General in changing phrases in the popular name and ballot title of a proposed initiated act, where phrases, as originally submitted, amounted to partisan coloring and were clearly calculated to influence voters to support the proposed initiated act, was appropriate. Jackson v. Clark, 288 Ark. 192, 703 S.W.2d 454, 730 S.W.2d 454 (1986).
      </p>
<p>
       Ballot question committee's request to compel the Attorney General to certify an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution was moot as the Attorney General's certification would have no practical legal effect on the parties because, under the 2019 amendment of this section, sponsors of initiated amendments were no longer required to obtain the Attorney General's certification of popular names and ballot titles before circulation of an initiative petition.

       The ballot title should be complete enough to convey an intelligible idea of the scope and import of the proposed law. It must be free from misleading tendency and contain no partisan coloring. Westbrook v. McDonald, 184 Ark. 740, 43 S.W.2d 356 (1931); Shepard v. McDonald, 189 Ark. 29, 70 S.W.2d 566 (1934); Coleman v. Sherrill, 189 Ark. 843, 75 S.W.2d 248 (1934); Blocker v. Sewell, 189 Ark. 924, 75 S.W.2d 658 (1934); Walton v.

McCuen, 296 Ark. 504, 758 S.W.2d 398 (1988).
      </p>
<p>
       When the general subject of an initiated act or constitutional amendment is disclosed by the title thereof, no detailed matter need be mentioned. Newton v. Hall, 196 Ark. 929, 120 S.W.2d 364 (1938).
      </p>
<p>
       It was not necessary that the ballot title to a proposed constitutional amendment providing for the refunding of the state's bonded indebtedness should disclose the creation of a new office therein provided for. Newton v. Hall, 196 Ark. 929, 120 S.W.2d 364 (1938).
      </p>
<p>
       A ballot title for a proposed constitutional amendment is sufficient if it identifies the proposed act and fairly recites the general purpose, and it need not be so elaborate as to set forth the details of the act. However, a popular name and a ballot title must be free from catch phrases and slogans which tend to mislead and to color the merit of a proposal on one side or the other. Becker v. Riviere, 270 Ark. 219, 604 S.W.2d 555 (1980).
      </p>
<p>
       It is difficult to prepare a perfect ballot title; it is sufficient if it informs the voters with such clarity that they can cast their ballot with a fair understanding of the issue presented. Ferstl v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 504, 758 S.W.2d 398 (1988).
      </p>
<p>
       The ballot title must accurately reflect the general purposes and fundamental provisions of the proposed initiative, so that an elector does not vote for a proposal based on its description in the ballot title, when, in fact, the vote is for a position he might oppose. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).
      </p>
<p>
       The ballot title need not recite all of the details of the proposal; however, if the information would give the elector “serious ground for reflection” it is not a mere detail and must be disclosed. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).
      </p>
<p>
       The Supreme Court has declared popular names invalid because they were misleading or used biased language. However, because so little is required of a popular name, the court has never held a proposed measure invalid solely because of an incomplete description of the act by the popular name. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).

       Emergency clause of Acts 2019, No. 376 was defective where the stated basis was “to avoid confusion in petition circulation”; Act 376 added additional requirements for getting a referendum on the election ballot, and the prospect of affording those who seek to file a ballot petition additional notice of new requirements for that petition, especially when the people would not be voting on any such initiatives or referenda for at least another 15 months, did not amount to an emergency under Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 1.

<p>
       It is the duty of the Supreme Court in reviewing initiated proposed constitutional amendments to see that ballot titles and popular names are (1) intelligible, (2) honest, and (3) impartial. Ark. Women's Political Caucus v. Riviere, 283 Ark. 463, 677 S.W.2d 846 (1984); Ferstl v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 504, 758 S.W.2d 398 (1988); Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).
      </p>
<p>
       Whether the Attorney General has correctly determined the sufficiency of the popular name and ballot title is a matter of law to be decided by the Supreme Court. It is not at all comparable to a finding of fact by a trial court, which the court will set aside only if it is clearly erroneous. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).
      </p>
<p>
       In determining the sufficiency of a ballot title, the Supreme Court will give a liberal construction and interpretation of the requirements of Ark. Const. Amend. 7, which amended Ark.

        Purposes of Ballot Title or Popular Name.
       </b>
</h4>
<p>
       The popular name actually serves the constitutional requirement of submission in a manner enabling the voters to vote on proposed amendments separately and it is a device useful to facilitate voter discussion prior to election, and it need not contain detailed information or include exceptions which might be required of a ballot title. Chaney v. Bryant, 259 Ark. 294, 532 S.W.2d 741 (1976).
      </p>
<p>
       The purpose of a ballot title is not to interpret the proposed amendment, but rather to present an impartial and accurate summation of its provisions. Mason v. Jernigan, 260 Ark. 385, 540 S.W.2d 851 (1976).
      </p>
<p>
       The Supreme Court will make a more detailed examination and analysis of the proposed ballot title than it does the popular name. The popular name is designed primarily to identify the proposal, while the ballot title is designed to adequately summarize the provisions of the proposal and be complete enough to convey to the voter an intelligible idea of the scope and import of the proposal. Ferstl v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 504, 758 S.W.2d 398 (1988).
      </p>
<p>
       The popular name is designed to make it easy for voters to discuss the proposal prior to the election by giving them a label to identify it. Gaines v. McCuen, 296 Ark. 513, 758 S.W.2d 403 (1988).

       Under Ark. Const.

       Use of the term “anything of value” in defining “paid canvasser” in this section is not unconstitutionally vague.

       Former subdivision (b)(7) of this section was unconstitutional in providing that every signature on a petition part was invalidated if the part contained signatures of more than one county; in invalidating an entire petition part for issues with individual signatures, the provision went beyond the power granted to the legislature in Ark.

       A.C.R.C. Notes.
      </b>
      Acts 2013, No. 1413, §
   1 provided: “Legislative findings.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Through Amendment 7 to the Arkansas Constitution, the people of Arkansas have reserved to themselves the power to propose legislative measures, laws, and amendments to the Arkansas Constitution and to enact or reject the proposed measures, laws, and amendments at the polls independently of the General Assembly;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The citizens of this state have an expectation that their right of initiative and referendum will be respected and that the process of gathering signatures of registered voters will be free of fraud, forgery, and other illegal conduct by sponsors, canvassers, notaries, and petitioners;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Sponsors and paid canvassers may have an incentive to knowingly submit forged or otherwise invalid signatures in order to obtain additional time to gather signatures and submit supplemental petitions;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      In 2012, sponsors of four (4) separate initiative petitions submitted petitions to the Secretary of State containing over two hundred ninety-eight thousand (298,000) purported signatures of registered voters;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Of the four petitions submitted, none had an initial validity rate in excess of fifty-six percent (56%), and three (3) of the petitions had an initial validity rate below thirty-one percent (31%); and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Of the three petitions with the lowest initial validity rate, there were widespread instances of apparent fraud, forgery, and false statements in the signature-gathering process.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      It is further found and determined by the General Assembly that if an effort is not made to address these issues:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Untrained paid canvassers will continue to obtain and submit forged and otherwise facially invalid signatures; and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Unscrupulous sponsors and canvassers will continue to have an incentive to submit forged and otherwise facially invalid signatures and make false statements to the Secretary of State.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(c)
      </b>
      It is further found and determined by the General Assembly that if this act becomes law:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Sponsors and canvassers of proposed initiative measures will be held more accountable for their actions in gathering signatures from registered voters; and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The earlier determination of the insufficiency of petitions rife with false statements, forged signatures, and otherwise facially invalid signatures will result in less confusion and frustration with the initiative process.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(d)
      </b>
      For the reasons stated in this section, the General Assembly finds that passage of this act will make sponsors and canvassers more accountable to the people of this state, facilitate the initiative process, conserve state resources, and help to restore the confidence and trust of the people in the initiative process.”

     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2013, No. 1413, § 22: Apr. 22, 2013. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that existing procedures for initiating and referring state laws and ordinances pursuant to Amendment 7 to the Arkansas Constitution and state statutes are inadequate to prevent fraudulent practices by sponsors and canvassers in obtaining ballot access; that this act addresses these inadequacies; and that this act is immediately necessary to prevent fraudulent practices because petition campaigns are either being conducted at the present time or may be conducted immediately upon the adjournment of the General Assembly with respect to either initiated or referred measures. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2019, No. 376, § 14: Mar. 8, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act amends the process for circulating initiative petitions and referendum petitions; and that the provisions of this act should become effective immediately so that its provisions apply to all petitions circulated after the passage of the act to avoid confusion in petition circulation. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”. The emergency clause for Acts 2019, No. 376 was held to be defective in Safe Surgery Ark. v. Thurston, 2019 Ark. 403.

      Acts 2013, No. 1413, §
   1 provided: “Legislative findings.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Through Amendment 7 to the Arkansas Constitution, the people of Arkansas have reserved to themselves the power to propose legislative measures, laws, and amendments to the Arkansas Constitution and to enact or reject the proposed measures, laws, and amendments at the polls independently of the General Assembly;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The citizens of this state have an expectation that their right of initiative and referendum will be respected and that the process of gathering signatures of registered voters will be free of fraud, forgery, and other illegal conduct by sponsors, canvassers, notaries, and petitioners;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Sponsors and paid canvassers may have an incentive to knowingly submit forged or otherwise invalid signatures in order to obtain additional time to gather signatures and submit supplemental petitions;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      In 2012, sponsors of four (4) separate initiative petitions submitted petitions to the Secretary of State containing over two hundred ninety-eight thousand (298,000) purported signatures of registered voters;
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Of the four petitions submitted, none had an initial validity rate in excess of fifty-six percent (56%), and three (3) of the petitions had an initial validity rate below thirty-one percent (31%); and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Of the three petitions with the lowest initial validity rate, there were widespread instances of apparent fraud, forgery, and false statements in the signature-gathering process.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      It is further found and determined by the General Assembly that if an effort is not made to address these issues:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Untrained paid canvassers will continue to obtain and submit forged and otherwise facially invalid signatures; and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Unscrupulous sponsors and canvassers will continue to have an incentive to submit forged and otherwise facially invalid signatures and make false statements to the Secretary of State.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(c)
      </b>
      It is further found and determined by the General Assembly that if this act becomes law:
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Sponsors and canvassers of proposed initiative measures will be held more accountable for their actions in gathering signatures from registered voters; and
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The earlier determination of the insufficiency of petitions rife with false statements, forged signatures, and otherwise facially invalid signatures will result in less confusion and frustration with the initiative process.
     </p>
<p>
<b>
       “(d)
      </b>
      For the reasons stated in this section, the General Assembly finds that passage of this act will make sponsors and canvassers more accountable to the people of this state, facilitate the initiative process, conserve state resources, and help to restore the confidence and trust of the people in the initiative process.”

       Emergency clause of Acts 2019, No. 376 was defective where the stated basis was “to avoid confusion in petition circulation”; Act 376 added additional requirements for getting a referendum on the election ballot, and the prospect of affording those who seek to file a ballot petition additional notice of new requirements for that petition, especially when the people would not be voting on any such initiatives or referenda for at least another 15 months, did not amount to an emergency under Ark.

<p>
       As the emergency clause of Acts 2019, No. 376 was ineffective and Act 376’s new requirements were not in effect at the time petitioner filed its proposed referendum and supporting signatures, mandamus was granted directing the Secretary of State to address petitioner's referendum filings (seeking a referendum on Acts 2019, No. 579) under the pre-Act 376 legal framework for initiatives and referenda.

       Although, contrary to this section, an appointed district court judge who had filed as a candidate for the Court of Appeals erroneously used the title “Judge” in her signature of the political practices pledge, this section did not restrict courts from ordering a change on the ballot and current law only sanctioned those who did not sign the pledge; there was no penalty for those found to have included inaccurate information on the pledge.
