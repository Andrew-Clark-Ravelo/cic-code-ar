      Acts 1991, No. 454, § 6: Mar. 11, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the Director of the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology is in need of additional authority to deny applications for the issuance or transfer of permits if he determines that an applicant, or person with substantial influence over the applicant, has a history of noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations; this act provides such authority and should be given immediate effect in order to grant additional environmental protection as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the protection of the public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1993, No. 1254, § 9: July 1, 1993. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the provisions of this act are of critical importance to the state's ability to provide efficient and effective programs in the protection of the state's environment as mandated through the activities of the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1993.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1995, No. 509, § 7: Mar. 2, 1995. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that an adjustment is needed to adjust the collection cap due to additional fees to be generated by the permitting of composting facilities and transfer stations, and to clarify cost recovery authorization for administrative services provided by the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2007, No. 1281, § 52: July 1, 2007.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2007.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

      Acts 1961, No. 120, § 9: Feb. 21, 1961. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas, operating experience under Act 472 of 1949 has revealed ambiguous and inadequate provisions which the foregoing amendments will eliminate and correct, and whereas a continuation of said ambiguous and inadequate provisions would be inimical to the proper control and abatement of water pollution and to the public peace, health, and safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act shall be in full force and effect from the date of its approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1965, No. 183, § 8: Mar. 10, 1965. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas, the pollution of the air resources of the State of Arkansas by air contaminants can create serious hazards to the public health and welfare of the people; and, whereas, it is the public policy of the state to maintain such a reasonable degree of purity of the air to the end that the least possible injury shall be done to human, plant or animal life or to property, and to maintain public enjoyment of the state's natural resources, consistent with the economic and industrial well-being of the state; and, whereas, existing laws to prevent, control, and abate air pollution are inadequate to protect the health and general welfare of the people; now, therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act shall be in full force and effect from the date of its approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1973, No. 262, § 13: Mar. 9, 1973. Emergency clause provided: “It being found that the existing state laws relating to water pollution control do not contain adequate legal authority for the state to continue to administer its own permit program for discharges into navigable waters within the state in lieu of that of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and it being desirable that such authority be provided, an emergency is, therefore, declared hereby to exist and this act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

     <p>
      Acts 1975, No. 743, § 11: Apr. 3, 1975. Emergency clause provided: “It being found that the existing state laws relating to water pollution control do not contain adequate legal authority for the state to continue to administer its own permit program for discharges into navigable waters within the state in lieu of that of the Federal Environmetal Protection Agency and it being desirable that such authority be provided, an emergency is, therefore, declared hereby to exist and this act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

      Acts 1991, No. 1057, § 9: Apr. 9, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the 78th General Assembly that the sanctions imposed by current Arkansas law for environmental violations are among the least stringent in the nation. Thus, current law is inadequate to deter environmental violations, and in fact extends an implicit invitation to irresponsible industries. Protection of the environmental integrity of this state is essential to protect the public's health and economic well-being. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Acts 2005, No. 1824, § 20: July 1, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “The General Assembly of the State of Arkansas hereby finds and determines that the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court in Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality v. Brighton Corp. 352 Ark. 396, 102 S.W.3d 458 (2003), has raised questions regarding the factual proof required to establish a claim for cost recovery under the Arkansas Remedial Action Trust Fund Act and regarding the retroactivity of the statute. The General Assembly further finds and determines that the doubts raised by the decision in the Brighton case have created substantial uncertainty regarding the enforcement authority of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality and the rights and responsibilities of private parties under the Arkansas Remedial Action Trust Fund Act, all of which require urgent resolution. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist; and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2005, and shall apply retroactively.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

      Acts 1961, No. 120, § 8, which amended Acts 1949, No. 472, § 10, provided, in part, that it was the purpose of the act to provide additional and cumulative remedies to prevent, abate, and control the pollution of the waters of the state, and that nothing contained in the act should be construed to abridge or alter rights of action or remedies in equity or under the common law or statutory law, criminal or civil, nor should any provision of the act, or any action done by virtue of the act, be construed as estopping the state, or any municipality or person, as riparian owners or otherwise, in the exercise of their rights in equity or under the common law or statutory law, to suppress nuisances or to abate pollution.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Acts 1975, No. 743, § 1, the General Assembly found and declared that since the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (<cite class="us_code">33 U.S.C. § 1251</cite> et seq.), provided for a permit system (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) to regulate the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the United States and provided that permits may be issued by states which are authorized to implement the provisions of that act, it was in the interest of the people of the State of Arkansas to amend the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act, as amended (§§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-101" target="_self">8-4-101</a></cite> — <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-106" target="_self">8-4-106</a></cite>, <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-201" target="_self">8-4-201</a></cite> — <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-229" target="_self">8-4-229</a></cite>, <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-301" target="_self">8-4-301</a></cite> — <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-314" target="_self">8-4-314</a></cite>), in a manner so as to provide required legal authority to the State of Arkansas, through the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology, to implement the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, and thereby to continue in effect the state permit program for the prevention and elimination of pollution of all waters of the state, including navigable waters.

      Acts 1991, No. 1057, § 1, provided: “The General Assembly finds and determines that the criminal and civil penalties imposed by current law do not accurately reflect the degree of concern which the state places upon its environmental resources. The current criminal penalties for hazardous waste and other violations are among the lowest in the nation. Civil penalties for violations of the state water, air, solid waste and hazardous waste pollution control statutes are set at the minimum necessary to receive federally delegated programs. In declaring itself ‘The Natural State,’ the State of Arkansas demonstrated its commitment to its environmental resources. This commitment must be reflected in its environmental enforcement program. This act shall be liberally construed so as to achieve remedial intent.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 1057, § 5, is also codified as §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c06s8-6-204ol1f" target="_self">8-6-204 (f)</a></cite>-(i) and <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c07s8-7-204ol1f" target="_self">8-7-204 (f)</a></cite>-(i).

     <p>
      Acts 1993, No. 731, § 1, provided: “Purpose. The state of Arkansas has an abundance of environmental concerns which need research and study, as well as concerns which have an immediate remedy but are absent funds to facilitate their implementation. This amendment serves to clarify the existing use of inkind services as penalties, to include cash contributions for use in worthy environmental projects and to advance environmental interests.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Amendments.
   
   The 2013 amendment, in the introductory language of (i), inserted “as defined by § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c03s5-3-301" target="_blank">5-3-301</a></cite> et seq.” and deleted “§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c03s5-3-301" target="_blank">5-3-301</a></cite> et seq. and” following “as defined by”.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2019 amendment by No. 315, throughout the section, deleted “regulation” following “rule”, substituted “rules” for “regulations”, and made similar changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2019 amendment by No. 693, in (l)(1) and (l)(2), substituted “upon conviction is guilty of a violation and is” for “is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction is”.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2019 amendment by No. 910 substituted “Division of Environmental Quality” for “Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality” in (a)(1)(A) and (d)(1)(A); and substituted “Division of Environmental Quality” for “department” throughout the section.

       Where the record showed that dioxin was escaping from a plant site in quantities that under an acceptable, but unproved, theory could be considered as teratogenic, mutagenic, fetotoxic, and carcinogenic, there was a reasonable medical concern over the public health, and therefore the escape of dioxin into a creek and bayou from the plant site constituted an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons and was subject to abatement.

      Acts 1949, No. 472, § 2, in part, created and established within the State Board of Health a Water Pollution Control Commission. Acts 1965, No. 183, § 2, in part, amended the section to create and establish the Arkansas Pollution Control Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1971, No. 38, § 8, in part, transferred the Pollution Control Commission and its functions, powers, and duties to the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology by a type 4 transfer and provided in part, that any reference to the Pollution Control Commission and its director would be deemed to refer to the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology and the director of the department, respectively. However, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.25.html#t25c02s25-2-107" target="_blank">25-2-107</a></cite> provides that governing bodies such as the Pollution Control Commission shall retain their statutory authority, powers, duties, and functions upon transfer by a type 4 transfer.

       Publisher's Notes.
      </b>
      Acts 1961, No. 120, § 8, which amended Acts 1949, No. 472, § 10, provided, in part, that it was the purpose of the act to provide additional and cumulative remedies to prevent, abate, and control the pollution of the waters of the state and that nothing contained in the act should be construed to abridge or alter rights of action or remedies in equity or under the common law or statutory law, criminal or civil, nor should any provision of the act, or any action done by virtue of the act, be construed as estopping the state, or any municipality or person, as riparian owners or otherwise, in the exercise of their rights in equity or under the common law or statutory law, to suppress nuisances or to abate pollution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1965, No. 183, § 6, provided that Acts 1949, No. 472, §§ 1-12 (subchapters 1 and 2 of this chapter) were designated as comprising “Part 1, Water Pollution.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1973, No. 262, § 1, provided that it was the purpose of this act to amend the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act (§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-101" target="_self">8-4-101</a></cite> et seq.) in such manner as to qualify and provide required legal authority to the State of Arkansas, through the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology for participation in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System as provided by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, adopted October 18, 1972 (codified primarily as 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), and to continue in effect the state permit program for the prevention and elimination of pollution of all waters of the state, including navigable waters.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Acts 1975, No. 743, § 1, the General Assembly found and declared that since the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (<cite class="us_code">33 U.S.C. § 1251</cite> et seq.), provides for a permit system (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) to regulate the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the United States and provides that permits may be issued by states which are authorized to implement the provisions of that act, it was in the interest of the people of the State of Arkansas to amend the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act, as amended (§§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-101" target="_self">8-4-101</a></cite> — <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-106" target="_self">8-4-106</a></cite>, <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-201" target="_self">8-4-201</a></cite> — <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-229" target="_self">8-4-229</a></cite>, <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-301" target="_self">8-4-301</a></cite> — <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-314" target="_self">8-4-314</a></cite>), in a manner so as to provide required legal authority to the State of Arkansas, through the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology, to implement the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, and thereby to continue in effect the state permit program for the prevention and elimination of pollution of all waters of the state, including navigable waters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 1219, § 1, provided: “Legislative intent. With Act 1230 of 1991, the General Assembly sought to delineate the respective responsibilities of the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission and the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control & Ecology. Confusion on these issues in the public’s perception continues, however, primarily because of the similarity in the names of these entities. The purpose of this Act is to achieve the legislative intent of Act 1230 of 1991 and to definitively assign the executive, adjudicatory, and rulemaking roles for the State’s regulatory functions concerning protection of the environment.”

       Effective Dates.
      </b>
      Acts 1961, No. 120, § 9: Feb. 21, 1961. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas, operating experience under Act 472 of 1949 has revealed ambiguous and inadequate provisions which the foregoing amendments will eliminate and correct, and whereas a continuation of said ambiguous and inadequate provisions would be inimical to the proper control and abatement of water pollution and to the public peace, health, and safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act shall be in full force and effect from the date of its approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1965, No. 183, § 8: Mar. 10, 1965. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas, the pollution of the air resources of the State of Arkansas by air contaminants can create serious hazards to the public health and welfare of the people; and, whereas, it is the public policy of the state to maintain such a reasonable degree of purity of the air to the end that the least possible injury shall be done to human, plant or animal life or to property, and to maintain public enjoyment of the state's natural resources, consistent with the economic and industrial well-being of the state; and, whereas, existing laws to prevent, control, and abate air pollution are inadequate to protect the health and general welfare of the people; now, therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act shall be in full force and effect from the date of its approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1973, No. 262, § 13: Mar. 9, 1973. Emergency clause provided: “It being found that the existing state laws relating to water pollution control do not contain adequate legal authority for the state to continue to administer its own permit program for discharges into navigable waters within the state in lieu of that of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and it being desirable that such authority be provided, an emergency is, therefore, declared hereby to exist and this act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1975, No. 743, § 11: Apr. 3, 1975. Emergency clause provided: “It being found that the existing state laws relating to water pollution control do not contain adequate legal authority for the state to continue to administer its own permit program for discharges into navigable waters within the state in lieu of that of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and it being desirable that such authority be provided, an emergency is, therefore, declared hereby to exist and this act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1995, No. 943, § 6: Apr. 5, 1995. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that, in order to avoid the needless disruption of business in this state, the director of the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology should be given authority to grant temporary variances and interim authority to construct or operate regulated activities. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2009, No. 369, § 2: Mar. 10, 2009. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that establishing financial assurance requirements for the closure of commercial facilities that engage in land application or storage of fluids generated or utilized during exploration or production phases of oil or gas operations is necessary to protect human health and the environment and that a delay in the effective date of this Act may result in harm to human health or the environment. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after the date of its passage or approval. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2013, No. 954, § 3. Emergency clause failed to pass. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that clarification of the methodology for developing, implementing, and assessing state water quality standards for minerals and the procedure for identifying and protecting the use of domestic water supplies is needed to avoid unnecessary regulation and the inefficient use and allocation of scarce resources; and that this act is immediately necessary to ensure that existing regulatory requirements provide demonstrable benefits at reasonable costs and available resources are wisely allocated. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2013 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 4, § 2: Oct. 21, 2013. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that in response to the General Assembly's adoption of Act 954 of 2013, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has taken adverse action with respect to the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality's ability to issue permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program; and that an immediate repeal of Act 954 of 2013 is necessary to alleviate such adverse action by the agency. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

   Under current interpretations by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the development, implementation, and assessment of water quality standards required under the Clean Water Act, <cite class="us_code">33 U.S.C. § 1251</cite> et seq., are to be based on sound scientific and statistical principles, among other things, and should consider readily available data that is consistent with and relevant to the water use to be maintained;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Federal law requires the consideration of certain relevant factors, including natural variability and statistical variability over periods of time that are relevant to the water use to be maintained;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      After consideration of readily available data, reliance on data that is not significant or meaningful, is incomplete, is not indicative of conditions relevant to the water use to be maintained, is speculative, is inconclusive or reasonably supportive of different conclusions, or is otherwise not well-suited to the purpose for which it is being used, has the potential to lead to unnecessary regulation and the inefficient use and allocation of scarce resources;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      The State of Arkansas has a well-developed and long-standing program of sampling the quality of waters subject to various uses;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      There is a rational basis found in sound scientific and statistical principles for using long-term averages in assessing mineral concentrations in a stream;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality's analysis of data from Arkansas streams demonstrates that four cubic feet per second (4 ft³/s) is the median flow for small streams, which makes this measure an appropriate indicator for stream flow when long-term flow data is not available, thereby avoiding unnecessary regulation and the inefficient use of state resources;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)
      </b>
      It is appropriate and consistent with sound scientific and statistical principles to use the greater of long-term average flows or four cubic feet per second (4 ft³/s) for assessing mineral concentrations in streams; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(8)
      </b>
      Because of the existing technological and economic limits on treatability of dissolved minerals and the likely localized economic impacts of the treatability requirement, it is an inefficient use of scarce resources to apply domestic water supply uses and criteria to streams, stream segments, or other bodies of water that do not have an existing domestic water supply use or that do not have a demonstrated and reasonable potential to be used as a domestic water supply source.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      The intent of this act is to:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Provide for the consideration of existing and readily available data and information relevant to the development, implementation, and assessment of water quality standards for minerals;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Provide standards for determining the data that should be considered and relied on by the State of Arkansas and its agencies for the development, implementation, and assessment of water quality standards for minerals; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Direct state agencies to support the development, implementation, and assessment of water quality standards according to the provisions of this act.”

       Subsection (d) of this section is intended simply to expedite the process of bringing an Arkansas Pollution Control & Ecology Commission ruling forward for appellate review, and there is no intent to divest the appellate court of its ordinary function. Therefore, in a case where an administrative decision to affirm the granting of a permit to build and operate a new steel mill was upheld, the appellate court did not have to review a decision from the Commission in the posture of a circuit court.

       Pursuant to subsection (c), the organizations failed to meet their burden of showing that the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission's decision affirming the issuance of air and hazardous-waste permits for the construction of a facility to dispose of chemical weapons was erroneous because they failed to show that the issuance of the permits for the facility would cause air pollution, as defined in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-303ol15" target="_self">8-4-303(5)</a></cite>; thus, the Commission's decision to issue the permits was supported by substantial evidence and was proper.

       In a case concerning a permit to operate a steel mill, the decision was not subject to de novo review because this section unquestionably required a deferential review of Arkansas Pollution Control & Ecology Commission rulings, which was inconsistent with a de novo review. Moreover, a ruling on the issuance of a regulatory permit was an exercise of executive function, hinging on executive discretion, and was not a quasi-judicial ruling.

      </b>
      Acts 1965, No. 183, § 7, provided in part that Acts 1949, No. 472 was amended by adding a new “Part 2, Air Pollution” (subchapter 3 of this chapter).
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 1219, § 1, provided: “Legislative intent. With Act 1230 of 1991, the General Assembly sought to delineate the respective responsibilities of the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission and the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control & Ecology. Confusion on these issues in the public's perception continues, however, primarily because of the similarity in the names of these entities. The purpose of this Act is to achieve the legislative intent of Act 1230 of 1991 and to definitively assign the executive, adjudicatory, and rulemaking roles for the State's regulatory functions concerning protection of the environment.”

      Acts 1949, No. 472, § 12: approved Mar. 29, 1949. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas, the pollution of the waters and the streams in the State of Arkansas from sewage, industrial waste, garbage, municipal refuse, and many other sources has created and is creating a hazard and danger to the public health of the people of the State of Arkansas, and is endangering the fish and other wildlife of the State of Arkansas; and, whereas, improper and inadequate sewer systems and disposal plants and treatment works cannot be adequately inspected, checked, and supervised under existing laws; and, whereas, present laws to prevent the pollution of the streams and to protect the health and general welfare of the people are inadequate and there are overlapping authorities as to control and regulations; and whereas, the continuance of such conditions presents an immediate and continuing threat and hazard to the public peace, health, and safety, therefore an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1965, No. 183, § 8: Mar. 10, 1965. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas, the pollution of the air resources of the State of Arkansas by air contaminants can create serious hazards to the public health and welfare of the people; and, whereas, it is the public policy of the state to maintain such a reasonable degree of purity of the air to the end that the least possible injury shall be done to human, plant, or animal life or to property, and to maintain public enjoyment of the state's natural resources, consistent with the economic and industrial well-being of the state; and, whereas, existing laws to prevent, control, and abate air pollution are inadequate to protect the health and general welfare of the people; now, therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act shall be in full force and effect from the date of its approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1995, No. 943, § 6: Apr. 5, 1995. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that, in order to avoid the needless disruption of business in this state, the director of the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology should be given authority to grant temporary variances and interim authority to construct or operate regulated activities. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 179, § 38: Feb. 17, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 10 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1995 abolished the Joint Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and in its place established the House Interim Committee and Senate Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor; that various sections of the Arkansas Code refer to the Joint Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and should be corrected to refer to the House and Senate Interim Committees on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor; that this act so provides; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to make the laws compatible as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2013, No. 1302, § 6: Apr. 18, 2013. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the current policy of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality of implementing the National Ambient Air Quality Standards through stationary source permitting is more stringent than the practices of other states in the region, thereby discouraging the expenditure of capital improvement funds for economic development and environmental improvement projects within the State of Arkansas; and that this act is immediately necessary to align the policies for implementation of National Ambient Air Quality Standards and the development of state implementation plans to those of the federal government and other states. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

       Publisher's Notes.
      </b>
      Acts 1997, No. 1219, § 1, provided: “Legislative intent. With Act 1230 of 1991, the General Assembly sought to delineate the respective responsibilities of the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission and the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control & Ecology. Confusion on these issues in the public’s perception continues, however, primarily because of the similarity in the names of these entities. The purpose of this Act is to achieve the legislative intent of Act 1230 of 1991 and to definitively assign the executive, adjudicatory, and rulemaking roles for the State’s regulatory functions concerning protection of the environment.”
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Effective Dates.
      </b>
      Acts 1997, No. 179, § 38: Feb. 17, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 10 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1995 abolished the Joint Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and in its place established the House Interim Committee and Senate Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor; that various sections of the Arkansas Code refer to the Joint Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and should be corrected to refer to the House and Senate Interim Committees on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor; that this act so provides; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to make the laws compatible as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 288, § 5: July 1, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the provisions of this act are of major importance to the state's best interest to have all revenues of the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology deposited into the State Treasury for better accountability of financial resources. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1997.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

   This section, concerning fees, was derived from Acts 1959, No. 57, § 7. Acts 1959, No. 57, § 7 was also codified as § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c58s26-58-211" target="_blank">26-58-211</a></cite> [repealed]. Section <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c58s26-58-211" target="_blank">26-58-211</a></cite> was repealed by Acts 1993, No. 344, § 2. The title of Acts 1993, No. 344 was “an act to repeal certain taxes and fees levied by Arkansas Code Annotated which generate minimal revenue and are an administrative burden on the state; and for other purposes.” Accordingly, it appears that this section was impliedly repealed by Acts 1993, No. 344, § 2.

      Acts 1985, No. 690, § 12: Mar. 28, 1985. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and declared by the General Assembly that historically a significant portion of the funding of the cost of construction of wastewater projects has been provided through grants from the United States of America and in recent years funds available to local governments for such grants have been substantially reduced thereby placing an increasingly intolerable burden on local governments to provide the cost of constructing and improving such sewer service and facilities and there is an immediate and pressing need to provide such service, and that alternate means of financing and acquisition are needed. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act, being immediately necessary for the protection of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect, and be in full force, immediately on its passage and approval.”

     <p>
      The General Assembly declares that the policy of this state is to assure its citizens adequate public services, particularly wastewater projects, and solid waste disposal projects, at reasonable cost, and that such services are essential to the maintenance and general welfare of the citizens of this state and to the continued expansion of the state's economy, job market, and industrial base. However, the cost of constructing, owning, and operating capital facilities to meet the demand for those public services is becoming increasingly burdensome to cities, counties, and improvement districts, and it is desirable that innovative financing mechanisms be made available to assist the communities of this state in developing wastewater projects and solid waste disposal projects at reasonable cost. Private sector ownership and operation of capital facilities providing public services can result in cost savings to communities contracting for those public services. It is, therefore, in the best public interest of the state and its citizens that cities, counties, and improvement districts be authorized to cause such services to be provided by private enterprise and to contract with private owners or operators for providing the services to the public.

     <p>
      The General Assembly hereby finds that many areas of the state would benefit from long-term environmental remediation projects that significantly improve the effects caused by industrial or extractive activities. However, commitments by private enterprise to remedy such damages are discouraged by the prospect of civil liability based upon rigid application of state water quality standards to the enterprise's activities. The purpose of this subchapter is to preserve the state's approach to establishing water quality standards, while also encouraging private enterprises to make significant improvements to closed or abandoned sites that are of such magnitude that more than three (3) years would be required to complete the project.

With Act 1230 of 1991, the General Assembly sought to delineate the respective responsibilities of the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission and the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control & Ecology. Confusion on these issues in the public's perception continues, however, primarily because of the similarity in the names of these entities. The purpose of this Act is to achieve the legislative intent of Act 1230 of 1991 and to definitively assign the executive, adjudicatory, and rulemaking roles for the State's regulatory functions concerning protection of the environment.”

      Acts 1971, No. 237, § 15: Mar. 9, 1971. Emergency clause provided: “It has been found and it is hereby declared by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that it is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the people of the State of Arkansas, and to the conservation of natural resources and the minimizing of environmental damage that adequate sites and facilities be made available promptly for the proper disposal and recycling of solid wastes; that existing practices and laws are inadequate; that this act and the implementation thereof are necessary to the accomplishment of the foregoing purposes and to the welfare of the State of Arkansas and her people. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act, being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 1007, § 7: Apr. 8, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Eighth General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that city and county governments and solid waste authorities are not permitted to collect delinquent solid waste management system fees and service charges under the county property tax collection system which county subordinate service districts are currently authorized to use; that the use of the county property tax collection system will improve fee collection and increase revenues for county solid waste management; and that, at this time, there is an increasingly critical need to collect all necessary revenues to support the operation of city and county solid waste management systems and solid waste authorities. Therefore, in order to promote the effective collection of delinquent solid waste fees or service charges at this critical time, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 1057, § 9: Apr. 9, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the 78th General Assembly that the sanctions imposed by current Arkansas law for environmental violations are among the least stringent in the nation. Thus, current law is inadequate to deter environmental violations, and in fact extends an implicit invitation to irresponsible industries. Protection of the environmental integrity of this state is essential to protect the public's health and economic well-being. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1993, No. 1280, § 9: Apr. 21, 1993. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that some areas of the state are facing critical shortages of solid waste disposal capacity due to the difficulties in citing landfill facilities at the local level. It is found that the authority granted to municipalities and counties to adopt more restrictive standards for the location, design, construction, and maintenance of solid waste disposal sites and facilities than those adopted by the federal, state and regional laws, rules, regulations and orders has exacerbated and attenuated this crises and could thwart or jeopardize the purposes of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 and its efforts to protect the public health and the state's environmental quality by establishing regional solid waste management and planning. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 179, § 38: Feb. 17, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 10 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1995 abolished the Joint Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and in its place established the House Interim Committee and Senate Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor; that various sections of the Arkansas Code refer to the Joint Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and should be corrected to refer to the House and Senate Interim Committees on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor; that this act so provides; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to make the laws compatible as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Act 2005, No. 1824, § 20: July 1, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “The General Assembly of the State of Arkansas hereby finds and determines that the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court in Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality v. Brighton Corp. 352 Ark. 396, 102 S.W.3d 458 (2003), has raised questions regarding the factual proof required to establish a claim for cost recovery under the Arkansas Remedial Action Trust Fund Act and regarding the retroactivity of the statute. The General Assembly further finds and determines that the doubts raised by the decision in the Brighton case have created substantial uncertainty regarding the enforcement authority of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality and the rights and responsibilities of private parties under the Arkansas Remedial Action Trust Fund Act, all of which require urgent resolution. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist; and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2005, and shall apply retroactively.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2011, No. 174, § 2: Mar. 4, 2011. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that counties face a significant risk of nonpayment when a tenant is registered as an occupant for purposes of payment of solid waste management fees and charges; that an increasing number of tenants are not paying county solid waste management fees and charges; and that this act is necessary because counties are losing an increasing amount of revenue as the result of nonpayment of fees and charges by transient tenants. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

       The Arkansas Solid Waste Management Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c06s8-6-201" target="_self">8-6-201</a></cite> et seq., does not expressly grant municipalities the power to grant exclusive solid waste disposal franchises; however, the legislative intent to displace competition can be inferred from the statutory scheme because it is a necessary and reasonable consequence of engaging in the authorized activity. Regulation of solid waste management is one of the traditional public health functions of local government, and the legislative scheme contemplates displacing competition with regulation in the area of solid waste management and disposal.

   Pursuant to § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.01.html#t01c02s1-2-207" target="_blank">1-2-207</a></cite>, subdivision (e)(3) of this section is set out above as amended by Acts 1995, No. 895, § 5. This subdivision was also amended by Acts 1995, No. 547, § 2, to read as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(e)(3)(A)
      </b>
      The director, in his discretion, may accept in-kind services as partial mitigation of cash penalties for use in projects or programs designed to advance environmental interests.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>
      The violator may provide in-kind services as directed by the department by utilizing the violator's own expertise, by hiring and compensating subcontractors to perform the services, or by other financial arrangements in which the violator retains no monetary benefit, however remote.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(C)
      </b>
      The services shall not duplicate or augment services already provided by the department through appropriations of the General Assembly.”
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Publisher's Notes.
      </b>
      Acts 1991, No. 1057, § 1, provided: “The General Assembly finds and determines that the criminal and civil penalties imposed by current law do not accurately reflect the degree of concern which the state places upon its environmental resources. The current criminal penalties for hazardous waste and other violations are among the lowest in the nation. Civil penalties for violations of the state water, air, solid waste and hazardous waste pollution control statutes are set at the minimum necessary to receive federally delegated programs. In declaring itself “The Natural State,” the State of Arkansas demonstrated its commitment to its environmental resources. This commitment must be reflected in its environmental enforcement program. This act shall be liberally construed so as to achieve remedial intent.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 1057, § 5, is also codified as §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c04s8-4-103ol1h" target="_self">8-4-103(h)</a></cite>-(k) and <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c07s8-7-204ol1f" target="_self">8-7-204 (f)</a></cite>-(i).
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1993, No. 731, § 1, provided: “The State of Arkansas has an abundance of environmental concerns which need research and study, as well as concerns which have an immediate remedy but are absent funds to facilitate their implementation. This amendment serves to clarify the existing use of inkind services as penalties, to include cash contributions for use in worthy environmental projects and to advance environmental interests.”
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Amendments.
      </b>
      The 2019 amendment by No. 315 deleted “regulation” following “rule” in (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(A)(i); deleted “regulations” following “rules” in (b)(1) and (b)(4); and in (c), deleted “regulations” preceding “rules” in the first sentence, and substituted “rules” for “regulations” in the third sentence.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2019 amendment by No. 910 substituted “Division of Environmental Quality” for “Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality” in (a)(1)(A) and (e)(3)(A); and substituted “division” for “department” throughout the section.

       The trial court erroneously instructed the jury that the alternative violations in subdivisons (a)(3)-(5) were not separate offenses but alternative means of committing one offense, while the state's charge tracked only the language set out in subdivision (a)(4); thus, there was no way to know whether the jury found defendant guilty of disposal without a permit (subdivision (a)(3)), disposal of waste on another's property (subdivision (a)(4)), or creating a public nuisance, hazard, or polluted condition (subdivision (a)(5)).

      Acts 1971, No. 237, § 6; 1983, No. 612, § 1; 1985, No. 946, § 1; A.S.A. 1947, § 82-2706; Acts 1991, No. 1007, § 2; 1993, No. 1280, § 4; 1995, No. 547, § 5; 2001, No. 1720, § 3; 2005, No. 1272, § 1; 2011, No. 174, § 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Publisher's Notes.
      </b>
      Acts 1993, No. 1280, § 1, provided: “The Arkansas General Assembly makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      The present landfill capacity in the State of Arkansas is inadequate and is at or near the critical point;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      As of January 1, 1993, the capacity in Arkansas was about four and one-half (4½) years of landfill life for fifty-seven (57) municipal solid waste landfills;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      By the enactment of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991, the Regional Solid Waste Management Boards were established from the preceding Regional Solid Waste Boards and said Regional Solid Waste Boards were given additional powers and duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      The stated purpose for the enactment of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 was to protect the public health and the state's environmental quality by establishing regional solid waste management and planning. It was found that the preexisting system of relying upon solid waste management by individual counties and municipalities had fostered conditions in which certain areas of the state were facing capacity shortages of crises proportions, while others experienced a surfeit of capacity with individual disposal facilities which could not muster the resources for environmentally responsible operations. Despite the efforts of the Regional Solid Waste Management Boards to date, those conditions remain true at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Upon enacting Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 establishing the Regional Solid Waste Management Boards and providing for their powers and duties, the Seventy-eighth Arkansas General Assembly authorized the districts to issue rules and regulations which are consistent with and in accordance with, but no more restrictive than, all applicable environmental protection performance standards adopted by state law or incorporated by reference from federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(6)
   
   Despite the limitation that rules and regulations of the districts be consistent with and in accordance with, but no more restrictive than, the applicable state and federal law, pursuant to Arkansas Act 237 of 1971, Arkansas Code Annotated § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c06s8-6-209" target="_self">8-6-209</a></cite> (Repl.1991), counties and municipalities retain the authority to adopt standards, by ordinance, resolution, or order, for the location, design, construction and maintenance of solid waste disposal sites and facilities, that are more restrictive than those adopted by state law and by the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)
      </b>
      This authority vested in counties and municipalities has led in large part to the disparate environmental and economic concerns set out in Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 and summarized above and could thwart and jeopardize the purposes of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 and its efforts to protect the public health and the state's environmental quality by establishing regional solid waste management and planning.”
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Amendments.
      </b>
      The 2011 amendment rewrote (b)(1) and (2); and substituted “or are delinquent as of the date set by the quorum court by ordinance” for “as of November 1” in (b)(3).

      Acts 1993, No. 1280, § 1, provided: “The Arkansas General Assembly makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      The present landfill capacity in the State of Arkansas is inadequate and is at or near the critical point;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      As of January 1, 1993, the capacity in Arkansas was about four and one-half (4½) years of landfill life for fifty-seven (57) municipal solid waste landfills;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      By the enactment of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991, the Regional Solid Waste Management Boards were established from the preceding Regional Solid Waste Boards and said Regional Solid Waste Boards were given additional powers and duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      The stated purpose for the enactment of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 was to protect the public health and the state's environmental quality by establishing regional solid waste management and planning. It was found that the preexisting system of relying upon solid waste management by individual counties and municipalities had fostered conditions in which certain areas of the state were facing capacity shortages of crises proportions, while others experienced a surfeit of capacity with individual disposal facilities which could not muster the resources for environmentally responsible operations. Despite the efforts of the Regional Solid Waste Management Boards to date, those conditions remain true at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Upon enacting Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 establishing the Regional Solid Waste Management Boards and providing for their powers and duties, the Seventy-eighth Arkansas General Assembly authorized the districts to issue rules and regulations which are consistent with and in accordance with, but no more restrictive than, all applicable environmental protection performance standards adopted by state law or incorporated by reference from federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(6)
   
   Despite the limitation that rules and regulations of the districts be consistent with and in accordance with, but no more restrictive than, the applicable state and federal law, pursuant to Arkansas Act 237 of 1971, Arkansas Code Annotated § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c06s8-6-209" target="_self">8-6-209</a></cite> (Repl.1991), counties and municipalities retain the authority to adopt standards, by ordinance, resolution, or order, for the location, design, construction and maintenance of solid waste disposal sites and facilities, that are more restrictive than those adopted by state law and by the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)
      </b>
      This authority vested in counties and municipalities has led in large part to the disparate environmental and economic concerns set out in Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 and summarized above and could thwart and jeopardize the purposes of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 and its efforts to protect the public health and the state's environmental quality by establishing regional solid waste management and planning.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that some areas of the state are facing critical shortages of solid waste disposal capacity due to the difficulties in siting landfill facilities at the local level. It is found that the authority granted to municipalities and counties to adopt more restrictive standards for the location, design, construction, and maintenance of solid waste disposal sites and facilities than those adopted by the federal, state and regional laws, rules, regulations, and orders, has exacerbated and attenuated this crises and could thwart or jeopardize the purposes of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 and its efforts to protect the public health and the state's environmental quality by establishing regional solid waste management and planning. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 179, § 38: Feb. 17, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 10 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1995 abolished the Joint Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and in its place established the House Interim Committee and Senate Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor; that various sections of the Arkansas Code refer to the Joint Interim Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and should be corrected to refer to the House and Senate Interim Committees on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor; that this act so provides; and that this act should go into effect immediately in order to make the laws compatible as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     <p>
      Acts 2012, No. 283, § 15: July 1, 2012. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2012 is essential to the operation of the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2012 could work irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2012.”
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

Therefore, in order to address this serious environmental problem, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Eighth General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that some areas of the state are facing critical shortages of solid waste disposal capacity due to the difficulties in sitting landfill facilities and the difficulties of financing public waste recovery and disposal facilities at the local level. It is found that regional solid waste authorities are needed to expedite the financing, sitting, and operation of new waste management facilities in order that the health and welfare of the citizens of Arkansas be insured and that the state's environment be protected. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

This bill will expand the ability of Regional Solid Waste Management Districts to seek the effective disposal of solid waste. Providing these agreements will enhance districts' ability to manage solid waste in a more cost-effective manner. Immediate action on this bill is necessary to provide uninterrupted solid waste disposal services throughout the state.

It is found that the regional solid waste management districts and boards must have the authority to evaluate, manage and coordinate the siting, location, and operation of transfer stations in order that the health and welfare of the citizens of Arkansas be ensured and the state's environment be protected.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of this subchapter is to protect the public health and the state's environmental quality by establishing regional solid waste management and planning. The current system, relying upon solid waste management by individual counties and municipalities, has fostered present conditions in which certain areas of the state are facing capacity shortages of crisis proportions, while others experience a surfeit of capacity with individual disposal facilities which cannot muster the resources for environmentally responsible operators. Given these disparate environmental and economic concerns, the General Assembly concludes that regional solid waste management and planning, under the oversight of the Division of Environmental Quality and the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission, is essential to address the imminent and future needs of the state. The terms and obligations of this subchapter shall be liberally construed so as to achieve remedial intent.

      “The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      In 1989, the General Assembly recognized the need to create regional boards to address the disposal of solid waste and encourage programs to conserve landfill capacity in the State of Arkansas that was deemed
   inadequate and at or near the critical point;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      In 1991, as an effort to aid in the establishment of regional boards and to provide economic viability, the General Assembly granted to regional solid waste management boards certain powers to collect fees and charges and to allow the boards to carry out the mandate of the enabling legislation;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      There now appears to be an economic crisis affecting a number of the regional solid waste management boards in the state because a legal challenge has been made regarding the authority of regional solid waste management boards to charge certain fees and charges;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      Adequate solid waste management planning that affects the ability to charge fees and charges on solid waste generated within a district is in question because of the lack of clear direction within the existing statutes; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      The important steps the state has taken to encourage recycling and to address the state's solid waste management needs will be greatly hampered unless clear authority is given to regional solid waste management boards to charge fees and charges that will support the programs mandated by statute, but for which no other means of funding exists.”
     </p>

      Acts 2019, No. 1067, § 11, provided: “(a) The purpose of this act is to have the Environmental Compliance Resource Program operational and to make illegal dump control officers unnecessary on or before May 1, 2020.

      <b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      If legislation concerning the transformation of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality is enacted during this Regular Session of the General Assembly, the Arkansas Code Revisor and the Arkansas Code Revision Commission shall correct the references to the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality consistent with those laws”.

   Arkansas Act 754 of 1991 (codified at Ark. Code Ann. § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c06s8-6-606" target="_self">8-6-606</a></cite> (Supp. 1991)) amended Ark. Code Ann. § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c06s8-6-606" target="_self">8-6-606</a></cite> to increase the landfill disposal fees under the Solid Waste Management Recycling Fund Act. The landfill disposal fees under the Solid Waste Management Recycling Fund had previously been established by Arkansas Act 849 of 1989 and Arkansas Act 934 of 1989.

      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      The General Assembly has learned that in many areas of the state, residents and businesses are having their solid waste transported to and disposed of at landfill disposal sites in other states. By doing so, these residents and businesses are avoiding paying their share of taxes referenced above, as would ordinarily be passed on to the solid waste generator. By such transportation and disposal of solid waste in other states, this state is losing much needed revenues. Further, by requiring the payment of such fees on solid wastes disposed of within the state, but not on solid wastes generated within this state and transported to and disposed of in other states, the existing fee structure under the above-referenced law unfairly burdens landfill disposal entities within the state since they are required to pay said fees causing them to charge higher rates than their out of state competitors which do not have to pay such fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      In order to remedy the present situation, it is the finding of the Arkansas General Assembly that similar fees need to be assessed on all solid waste transported in Arkansas but disposed of outside the state. By doing so, the avoidance of landfill disposal fees by the transfer of solid waste out of state will be remedied and the current unfair burden on in-state landfill disposal entities will be alleviated.”

       Effective Dates.
      </b>
      Acts 1993, No. 1127, § 7: Apr. 13, 1993. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that some areas of the state are facing critical shortages of solid waste disposal capacity due to the difficulties in siting landfill facilities at the local level. It is found that the authority granted to municipalities and counties to adopt more restrictive standards for the location, design, construction, and maintenance of solid waste disposal sites and facilities than those adopted by the federal, state and regional laws, rules, regulations, and orders, has exacerbated and attenuated this crises and could thwart or jeopardize the purposes of Arkansas Act 752 of 1991 and its efforts to protect the public health and the state's environmental quality by establishing regional solid waste management and planning. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 938, § 9: July 1, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the fiscal year begins on July 1, and that this emergency clause is necessary in order that uniformity can be achieved at the beginning of the 1997-1998 fiscal year for money deposited into the Landfill Post-Closure Trust Fund and the moneys allocated from that fund for the Illegal Dump Eradication and Corrective Action Program. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1997.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1999, No. 1210, § 10: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the appropriation of funds for more than a two (2) year period; that the effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 1999 is essential to the operation of the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in the event of an extension of the Regular Session, the delay in the effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 1999 could work irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1999.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2015, No. 1037, § 2: Apr. 4, 2015. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that funds from the Landfill Post-Closure Trust Fund will alleviate problems in waste tire facility closures due to lack of funds; and that this act is immediately necessary because delays in waste tire facility closure pose a danger to the public health and safety. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

       As directed by Acts 1989, No. 870, the Arkansas Solid Waste Fact Finding Task Force [expired] has presented its findings and proposals. The task force report identifies serious and chronic deficiencies in how solid waste is managed in this state. The report is accompanied by legislative proposals which reaffirm the state's commitment to regional solid waste management embodied in Acts 1989, No. 870, and aim, through extensive revision of current law, to make regionalization a reality. The report and the task force's legislative proposals demonstrate that the state does not have sufficient understanding or control of the overall solid waste stream to realize its goal of regional solid waste management, much less a responsible recycling and source reduction program. These goals cannot be attained if the waste streams assigned to the respective regional solid waste planning districts continue to change during the crucial planning and development stages.

       Federal law, 42 U.S.C. § 6941 et seq., has placed the burden of implementing regional solid waste management strategies upon the states. To this end, the General Assembly has embarked upon the difficult task of addressing the complex solid waste needs of the state on a regional basis. After giving due regard to all of the contingencies and exigencies inherent in planning a regional solid waste strategy, and after accommodating existing business expectations based upon waste streams originating from outside the Acts 1989, No. 870, regional solid waste planning districts, the General Assembly hereby enacts the following emergency measure as an essential component of its efforts to reform solid waste management in Arkansas.

       The General Assembly has found that there is an increased interest in obtaining permits from the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality or the Division of Environmental Quality for the purpose of constructing and operating commercial medical waste incineration facilities. The Clean Air Act in 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(1)(C) has directed the United States Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations concerning these commercial medical waste incineration facilities. The General Assembly has determined that it is necessary to delay the issuance of permits to these commercial medical waste incineration facilities until those regulations are promulgated in order to ensure that any permits issued will be based on the latest available information concerning technology and safety as set forth in the federal regulations.

       As scientific understanding of the potential public health and environmental impacts from large-scale medical waste incineration evolves, the General Assembly finds that continued caution regarding the development of commercial medical waste incineration facilities is necessary in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Even though medical waste incinerators constitute major sources of potentially harmful emissions into the air, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has yet to promulgate technology standards necessary to assure safe operation. In the meantime, highly speculative ventures seek to profit from the regulatory uncertainty by promoting undercapitalized incineration facilities handling volumes of waste far in excess of that from the largest hospital.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that Act 1263 of 1993 is an act that is important to public health and welfare of citizens located near high impact solid waste management facilities. Ambiguities in the current language of Act 1263 of 1993 impair the ability of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality to protect the public health and welfare and a delay in the effective date of this act could work irreparable harm upon the ability of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality to effectively administer its regulatory functions and properly implement the public health protections provided through Act 1263 of 1993. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

      <li id="t08c06s8-6-1501ol1a">
       Through extensive legislation since 1989, the State of Arkansas has made significant strides toward a comprehensive and regionalized approach to solid waste management. The General Assembly recognizes the need to develop viable facilities for managing and disposing of the state's solid waste. This subchapter should be construed as a complement to the state's overall regionalization strategy by encouraging an equitable and efficient dispersal of solid waste management facilities to serve the needs of all citizens.
      </li>
      <li id="t08c06s8-6-1501ol1b">
       The General Assembly also acknowledges that, while solid waste management facilities are essential, certain types of solid waste management facilities impose specific burdens on the host community. National trends indicate a tendency to concentrate high impact solid waste disposal facilities in lower-income or minority communities. Such high impact solid waste disposal facilities may place an onus on the host community without any reciprocal benefits to local residents. The purpose of this subchapter is to prevent communities from becoming involuntary hosts to a proliferation of high impact solid waste management facilities.

      Acts 1997, No. 1219, § 1, provided: “Legislative intent. With Act 1230 of 1991, the General Assembly sought to delineate the respective responsibilities of the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission and the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control & Ecology. Confusion on these issues in the public's perception continues, however, primarily because of the similarity in the names of these entities. The purpose of this Act is to achieve the legislative intent of Act 1230 of 1991 and to definitively assign the executive, adjudicatory, and rulemaking roles for the State's regulatory functions concerning protection of the environment.”

      Acts 1979, No. 406, § 19: Mar. 14, 1979. Emergency clause provided: “It has been found and it is hereby declared by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that it is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the people of the State of Arkansas and to the minimizing of environmental damage that hazardous wastes be managed in an environmentally sound manner; that the knowledge and technology necessary for alleviating adverse health, environmental, and esthetic impacts resulting from current hazardous waste management and disposal practices are generally available at costs within the financial capabilities of those who generate such wastes, but that such knowledge and technology are not widely used; that existing practices and laws are inadequate; that this act and the implementation thereof are necessary to the accomplishment of the proper management of hazardous wastes and to the welfare of the State of Arkansas and her people. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act, being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1985, No. 920, § 3: Apr. 15, 1985. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that inequities now exist in the regulation of hazardous waste management in this state as a result of the permit term currently utilized, and it is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the people of the State of Arkansas and to the minimizing of environmental damage that hazardous wastes be managed in a sound manner which includes providing a sufficiently long permit term to insure that the proper investment of resources will be made in hazardous waste management facilities to provide for the proper management of hazardous wastes and to protect the welfare of the State of Arkansas and her people. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 435, § 5: Mar. 11, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, has indicated that the authorization for the hazardous waste management program for the State of Arkansas may be jeopardized for failure to provide court assessment of reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by a substantially prevailing complainant in an action against the state for failure to comply with the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act in cases involving the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 or other hazardous waste issues. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 1057, § 9: Apr. 9, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the 78th General Assembly that the sanctions imposed by current Arkansas law for environmental violations are among the least stringent in the nation. Thus, current law is inadequate to deter environmental violations, and in fact extends an implicit invitation to irresponsible industries. Protection of the environmental integrity of this state is essential to protect the public's health and economic well-being. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 1235, § 5: July 1, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the effectiveness of this act on July 1, 1991, is essential to the operation of the Hazardous Waste Management Program within the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology and that in the event of an extension of the Regular Session, the delay in the effective date of this act beyond July 1, 1991, could work irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of the essential government programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in effect from and after July 1, 1991.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1993, No. 1254, § 9: July 1, 1993. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the provisions of this act are of critical importance to the state's ability to provide efficient and effective programs in the protection of the state's environment as mandated through the activities of the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1993.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1999, No. 340, § 6: Mar. 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the provisions of the current statutes deny interim status to newly-regulated hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities otherwise entitled to operate under federal laws and regulations. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2005, No. 1166, § 2: Mar. 22, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that a decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court has called into question the authority of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality to enforce provisions of hazardous waste management permits; that this authority is necessary for the department to receive delegation from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to administer the federal hazardous waste management permit program; and that this act is immediately necessary to allow the State of Arkansas to continue to administer the federal hazardous waste management permit program, to continue to receive federal grants, and to prevent the State of Arkansas from losing approximately one million dollars ($1,000,000) in federal grant money. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Act 2005, No. 1824, § 20: July 1, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “The General Assembly of the State of Arkansas hereby finds and determines that the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court in Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality v. Brighton Corp. 352 Ark. 396, 102 S.W.3d 458 (2003), has raised questions regarding the factual proof required to establish a claim for cost recovery under the Arkansas Remedial Action Trust Fund Act and regarding the retroactivity of the statute. The General Assembly further finds and determines that the doubts raised by the decision in the Brighton case have created substantial uncertainty regarding the enforcement authority of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality and the rights and responsibilities of private parties under the Arkansas Remedial Action Trust Fund Act, all of which require urgent resolution. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist; and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2005, and shall apply retroactively.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

      Acts 1991, No. 1057, § 1, provided: “The General Assembly finds and determines that the criminal and civil penalties imposed by current law do not accurately reflect the degree of concern which the state places upon its environmental resources. The current criminal penalties for hazardous waste and other violations are among the lowest in the nation. Civil penalties for violations of the state water, air, solid waste and hazardous waste pollution control statutes are set at the minimum necessary to receive federally delegated programs. In declaring itself “The Natural State,” the State of Arkansas demonstrated its commitment to its environmental resources. This commitment must be reflected in its environmental enforcement program. This act shall be liberally construed so as to achieve remedial intent.”

      Acts 1993, No. 731, § 1 provided: “The state of Arkansas has an abundance of environmental concerns which need research and study, as well as concerns which have an immediate remedy but are absent funds to facilitate their implementation. This amendment serves to clarify the existing use of in-kind services as penalties, to include cash contributions for use in worthy environmental projects and to advance environmental interests.”

In drafting Act 643 of 1989, the General Assembly sought to allow for existing and newly-regulated hazardous waste management facilities to benefit from continued operation under interim status while their application for a treatment, storage, or disposal permit is being reviewed and processed for approval in exactly the same manner as provided for by the federal laws and regulations for these activities. As enacted, the language at § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c07s8-7-216ol1d" target="_self">8-7-216(d)</a></cite> and (e) would deny interim status to newly-regulated treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, a much more stringent requirement than envisioned in Act 643. The purpose of this Act is to achieve the legislative intent of Act 643 of 1989 and to restore equivalency of the state requirements with those of the federal government.”

   Acts 1985, No. 922, § 7: Apr. 15, 1985. Emergency clause provided: “It has been found and it is hereby declared by the General Assembly that inequalities now exist in the regulation of hazardous waste management in this state as a result of current provisions of Act 1098 of 1979 (§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t08c07s8-7-301" target="_self">8-7-301</a></cite> et seq.), and that said provisions jeopardize the federal delegation of authority necessary to operate a state hazardous waste management program in lieu of a federal program, thereby threatening the orderly development of the state's resources in a manner which will protect the health and welfare of the people of the State of Arkansas. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act, being necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, shall take effect and be in force from the date of its approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

     <ol>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-302ol11">
       The disposal of hazardous waste, although currently necessary for certain forms of hazardous waste, represents an inefficient use of natural resources and may present long-term threats to the environment and to the public health and safety;

      <li id="t08c07s8-7-302ol12">
       Technically and economically feasible treatment methods are becoming increasingly available and offer the advantages of complete destruction of hazardous waste or the recovery and reclamation of some, if not all, constituents of hazardous waste;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-302ol13">
       In addition to the recovery or reclamation of natural resources, treatment of hazardous waste reduces the volume of hazardous waste which must be disposed of and thereby reduces the associated threats to the environment and to the public health and safety;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-302ol14">
       Interstate cooperation is necessary to assure that the volume of hazardous waste which must be disposed of within the state is reduced through a comprehensive program which encourages and, when appropriate, requires the treatment of hazardous waste; and
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-302ol15">
       The Arkansas Hazardous Waste Management Act of 1979, § 8-7-201 et seq., authorizes the Division of Environmental Quality to encourage the development of interstate agreements for the management of hazardous waste and to enter into such interstate agreements, with the concurrence of the Governor.

      <li id="t08c07s8-7-303ol13">
       Encourage interstate cooperation and interstate agreements which would provide a requisite balance of disposal and treatment facilities among the states and which would reduce the amount of hazardous waste disposed of in the state, irrespective of the origin of the hazardous waste; and

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the laws of this state concerning the assessment of fees for the generation of hazardous waste which is managed in a totally enclosed treatment facility, an elementary neutralization unit, or a wastewater treatment unit are inequitable in that not all such management activities are assessed and the methodology of calculating the volume of waste generated is not uniform. Further, the fees are duplicative of fees assessed by the Water Division for the same activities when an NPDES or UIC Permit has been issued to authorize disposal of such wastes after treatment. Further, the assessment of such fees for activities such as the management in a totally enclosed treatment facility, an elementary neutralization unit, or a wastewater treatment unit can have the effect of discouraging the type of management activities that are proper and acceptable for such wastes. Further, the department will be issuing statements for hazardous waste generation activities in March of 1999 for 1998 hazardous waste activities, and this bill is necessary to avoid the assessment of unnecessary fees for 1998 hazardous waste activities and avoid disruption of the hazardous waste management program. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Act 2005, No. 1824, § 20: July 1, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “The General Assembly of the State of Arkansas hereby finds and determines that the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court in Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality v. Brighton Corp. 352 Ark. 396, 102 S.W.3d 458 (2003), has raised questions regarding the factual proof required to establish a claim for cost recovery under the Arkansas Remedial Action Trust Fund Act and regarding the retroactivity of the statute. The General Assembly further finds and determines that the doubts raised by the decision in the Brighton case have created substantial uncertainty regarding the enforcement authority of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality and the rights and responsibilities of private parties under the Arkansas Remedial Action Trust Fund Act, all of which require urgent resolution. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist; and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2005, and shall apply retroactively.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2011, No. 1011, § 8: July 1, 2011. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that lead and lead-based paint have been determined to be a human health concern posing an immediate danger to children, families, and the environment; and that this act is immediately necessary to prevent irreparable harm to children in this state. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2011.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

     </p>
     <p>
      “The General Assembly finds and declares as follow:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      The redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites should be encouraged as a sound land use management policy to prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open space and natural and recreation areas and to prevent urban sprawl;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites should be encouraged so that these sites can be returned to useful, tax producing properties to protect existing jobs and provide new job opportunities;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Persons interested in redeveloping abandoned industrial sites should have a method of determining what their legal liabilities and cleanup responsibilities will be as they plan the reuse of abandoned sites;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      Incentives should be put in place to encourage prospective purchasers to voluntarily develop and implement cleanup plans of abandoned industrial sites without the use of taxpayer funds or the need for adversarial enforcement actions by the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      The Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology now routinely, through its permitting policies, determines when contamination will and will not pose unacceptable risks to public health or the environment and similar concepts are used in establishing cleanup policies for abandoned industrial sites;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Parties and persons responsible under law for pollution at industrial sites should perform remedial responses which are fully consistent with existing requirements; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)
      </b>
      As an incentive to promote the redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites, persons not responsible for preexisting pollution at or contamination on industrial sites should meet alternative cleanup requirements if they acquire title after fully disclosing the nature of conditions at the site and declaring and committing to a specified future land use of the site.”

       “(1)
      </b>
      The redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites should be encouraged as a sound land use management policy to prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open space and natural and recreation areas and to prevent urban sprawl;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites should be encouraged so that these sites can be returned to useful, tax producing properties to protect existing jobs and provide new job opportunities;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Persons interested in redeveloping abandoned industrial sites should have a method of determining what their legal liabilities and cleanup responsibilities will be as they plan the reuse of abandoned sites;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      Incentives should be put in place to encourage prospective purchasers to voluntarily develop and implement cleanup plans of abandoned industrial sites without the use of taxpayer funds or the need for adversarial enforcement actions by the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      The Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology now routinely, through its permitting policies, determines when contamination will and will not pose unacceptable risks to public health or the environment and similar concepts are used in establishing cleanup policies for abandoned industrial sites;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Parties and persons responsible under law for pollution at industrial sites should perform remedial responses which are fully consistent with existing requirements; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)
      </b>
      As an incentive to promote the redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites, persons not responsible for preexisting pollution at or contamination on industrial sites should meet alternative cleanup requirements if they acquire title after fully disclosing the nature of conditions at the site and declaring and committing to a specified future land use of the site.”

       Effective Dates.
      </b>
      Acts 1989, No. 172, § 17: July 1, 1989. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 1989 is essential to the operation of the Underground Storage Tank Program created herein in the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology and that in the event of an extension of the Regular Session, the delay in the effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 1989 could work irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1989.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 594, § 5: Mar. 18, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that it is essential to the effective and efficient administration of the Regulated Storage Tank Program that this act be given effect immediately. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Identical Acts 1995, Nos. 427 and 436, § 5: Feb. 24, 1995. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that it is essential to the effective and efficient administration of the Regulated Storage Tank Program and the Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund that this act be given effect immediately. Therefore an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2001, No. 1471, § 6: Apr. 10, 2001. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the 83rd General Assembly that under present law a requirement for Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund eligibility is substantial compliance with applicable federal and state requirements. This eligibility requirement poses two significant problems. First, a storage tank owner or operator found ineligible for the Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund reimbursement is in reality penalized tens of thousands of dollars that are typically expended on investigation and/or remediation of petroleum releases. Second, the difficulty specifying the type of conduct that constitutes substantial compliance generates uncertainty as to whether the Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund will be available to owners or operators of such equipment. Consequently, it has been determined that instead of judging trust fund eligibility on the basis of substantial compliance, requiring owners and operators of storage tanks to annually complete and submit to the department self-inspection audits will better enhance environmental protection. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2007, No. 264, § 6: Mar. 9, 2007. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the distribution of federal funds to implement and effectuate the purpose and intent of this act and to carry out other essential governmental services relating to an underground storage tank release detection, prevention, corrective action, and financial responsibility program as required by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as it exists on January 1, 2007, is contingent upon implementing certain provisions of this act by February 8, 2007; that such federal funds are necessary to continue to provide essential governmental services; and that this act is immediately necessary because a delay in the effective date of this act may result in the loss of federal funds which could work irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental services. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

      Acts 1997, No. 1018, § 8: Apr. 2, 1997.

It is further found and determined by the General Assembly that the current law concerning expense reimbursement for the State Board of Collection Agencies does not conform to Arkansas Code <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.25.html#t25c16s25-16-901" target="_blank">25-16-901</a></cite> et seq.; the State Board of Collection Agencies should be allowed to receive a stipend; and that this act is immediately necessary for the effective operation of the State Board of Collection Agencies. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2001, No. 1471, § 6: Apr. 10, 2001. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the 83rd General Assembly that under present law a requirement for Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund eligibility is substantial compliance with applicable federal and state requirements. This eligibility requirement poses two significant problems. First, a storage tank owner or operator found ineligible for the Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund reimbursement is in reality penalized tens of thousands of dollars that are typically expended on investigation and/or remediation of petroleum releases. Second, the difficulty specifying the type of conduct that constitutes substantial compliance generates uncertainty as to whether the Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund will be available to owners or operators of such equipment. Consequently, it has been determined that instead of judging trust fund eligibility on the basis of substantial compliance, requiring owners and operators of storage tanks to annually complete and submit to the department self-inspection audits will better enhance environmental protection. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2003, No. 1114, § 7: Apr. 7, 2003. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that under present law a requirement for Petroleum Storage Tank Fund eligibility for reimbursement for third party claims for bodily injury and property damage is the payment of seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) to injured third parties by the owner or operator; that if the owner or operator is discharged in bankruptcy or declared insolvent, injured third parties may have no protection under the law; that existing law should be changed immediately so that injured third parties will be guaranteed access to the fund that is specifically designed to compensate them for their injuries; and that, in addition, owners or operators may not enjoy the protection originally intended by the General Assembly when it initially enacted this statute unless the definition of compensatory damages is clarified. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2003.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol11">
       The redevelopment of abandoned industrial, commercial, or agricultural sites or abandoned residential property should be encouraged as a sound land use management policy to prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open spaces, and natural and recreation areas and to prevent urban sprawl;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol12">
       The redevelopment of abandoned sites should be encouraged so that these abandoned sites can be returned to useful, tax-producing properties to protect existing jobs and provide new job opportunities;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol13">
       Persons interested in redeveloping abandoned sites should have a method of determining what their legal liabilities and cleanup responsibilities will be as they plan the reuse of abandoned sites;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol14">
       Incentives should be put in place to encourage prospective purchasers to voluntarily develop and implement cleanup plans of abandoned sites without the need for adversarial enforcement actions by the Division of Environmental Quality;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol15">
       The division now routinely determines, through its permitting policies, when contamination will and will not pose unacceptable risks to public health or the environment, and similar concepts are used in establishing cleanup policies for abandoned sites;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol16">
       Parties and persons responsible under the law for pollution at abandoned sites should perform remedial responses which are fully consistent with existing requirements;
      </li>
      <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol17">
       As an incentive to promote the redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites, persons not responsible for preexisting pollution at or contamination on abandoned industrial sites should meet alternative cleanup requirements if they acquire title after the nature of conditions at the abandoned industrial site has been disclosed and declare and commit to a specified future land use of the subject abandoned industrial site; and
      </li>

       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol18A">
         Property transactions at times necessitate title acquisition prior to completion of the actions contemplated at § 8-7-1104(b)-(d) by persons not previously involved with the abandoned site or otherwise considered responsible parties for environmental conditions at an abandoned site.
        </li>
        <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol18B">
         These persons should not be foreclosed from participation under the procedures enacted under this subchapter.

        <li id="t08c07s8-7-1101ol18C">
         Therefore, these persons, at the discretion of the Director of the Division of Environmental Quality, may submit a letter of intent that will set forth the persons' desire to purchase the abandoned site and retain their eligibility for participation in the voluntary cleanup program established by this subchapter.

        <li id="t08c08s8-8-101ol1a1">
         The purity and life-giving qualities of our environment are of primary concern to the people of Arkansas and to all Americans;

        ARTICLE I. Policy and Purpose
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The party states recognize that each state is responsible for the management of its nonfederal low-level radioactive wastes. They also recognize that the Congress, by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (Public Law 96-573), has authorized and encouraged states to enter into compacts for the efficient management of wastes. It is the policy of the party states to cooperate in the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens and the environment, and to provide for and encourage the economical management of low-level radioactive wastes. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the framework for such a cooperative effort; to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and the environment of the region; to limit the number of facilities needed to effectively and efficiently manage low-level radioactive wastes and to encourage the reduction of the generation thereof; and to distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations among the party states. It is the policy of the party states that activities conducted by the commission are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that all solid waste districts do not have waste tire collection centers and waste tire processing facilities; that some waste tires must be transported across district lines for recycling and processing; that whole waste tires must be processed prior to transportation across district lines; that it is an undue hardship on those persons transporting whole waste tires to process them prior to delivery at a permitted processing facility; and that this act allows transportation of whole waste tires across district lines to a permitted processing facility. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the provisions of this act are of critical importance to the state's ability to provide efficient and effective programs in the protection of the state's environment as mandated through the activities of the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology.

      Acts 1999, No. 775, § 5: Mar. 22, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the law concerning the waste tire grant program is inadequate for the protection of the public. Regional Solid Waste Management Districts are dependent on adequate grant funding, which this bill would provide. Without adequate funding, the Districts' efforts to manage waste tires, which can result in a blight on the countryside and hazardous and unhealthy conditions, would be hindered. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.
