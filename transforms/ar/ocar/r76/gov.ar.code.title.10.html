    There is certainly no clear limitation upon the legislative power to extend the session by a two-thirds vote and no clear specification of a time beyond which, in the discretion of the General Assembly, exercised by the vote of two-thirds of the members of both houses, the session may not be extended, and the determination of the date for termination of an extended session is a matter of legislative discretion.

       10-2-114. Bills imposing new or additional costs on municipality or county — Fiscal impact statements — Definition.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      (1)Any bill filed with the Senate that requires an expenditure of public funds by a municipality or county or otherwise imposes a new or increased cost obligation on any municipality or county shall have a fiscal impact statement attached to it prepared by the author of the bill and filed with the bill at the time of its introduction. A copy of such fiscal impact statement shall be placed on the desk of each member of the Senate committee to which the bill is referred before the bill may be called up for final action in the committee. A copy of it shall also be placed on the desk of each member of the Senate before a final vote may be taken on it for final passage.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the author of any Senate or House of Representatives bill affected by this section shall fail to file a fiscal impact statement, any member of the Senate committee to which the bill is referred may object to its being called up for final action in the committee until a fiscal impact statement is made available to the committee. If such an objection is made by a member of the Senate committee, the chair of the committee shall refer the bill to the appropriate state agency or to the legislative staff for the preparation of a fiscal impact statement, to be returned to the committee in writing not later than five (5) days from the date of the request.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any such Senate or House bill is called up for final passage in the Senate and a fiscal impact statement has not been provided by the author of the bill or by the committee to which the bill was referred, any member of the Senate may object to the bill's being called up for final passage until a fiscal impact statement is prepared and made available on the desk of each member of the Senate at least one (1) day prior to the bill’s being called up for final passage. If such an objection is made, the presiding officer of the Senate shall cause the bill to be referred to the appropriate state agency or to the designated legislative staff for the preparation of a fiscal impact statement which shall be filed in writing with the Senate not later than five (5) days from the date of the request.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)When any House or Senate bill requiring an expenditure of public funds or otherwise imposing a new or increased cost obligation on any municipality or county is pending before any committee of the House, any member of the committee may request that a fiscal impact statement for the bill be placed on the desk of each member of the committee before the bill is called up for final action in the committee. If a request is made, the chair of the committee shall refer the bill to the appropriate state agency or to the legislative staff for the preparation of a fiscal impact statement to be returned to the committee in writing not later than five (5) days from the date of the request.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any time before the bill is read the third time in the House, a member of the House may request that a fiscal impact statement for the bill be prepared and placed on the desk of each member. When a member of the House so requests a fiscal impact statement on any bill, the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall furnish the member a fiscal impact statement signature form which shows the number of the bill for which the statement is requested and the date and time the request was made. If the member returns the form containing the signature of the requesting member and the signatures of at least nine (9) other House members within thirty (30) minutes of the time shown on the form, the fiscal impact statement shall be prepared and placed on the desk of each member of the House before the bill is read the third time.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a bill is called up for final passage in the House and a fiscal impact statement has not been provided for the bill, any member of the House in which the bill is being considered may move that a final vote on the passage of the bill be delayed until a fiscal impact statement is prepared and made available on the desk of each member of the House at least one (1) full day prior to the bill's being called up for final passage. If the motion is made and is adopted by a majority vote of the membership of the House, the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall cause the bill to be referred to the appropriate state agency or to the designated legislative staff for the preparation of a fiscal impact statement which shall be filed with the House within five (5) days of the date of the request.
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure of the sponsor of a bill to provide the fiscal impact statement required in this section shall not prohibit the consideration of it in the committee to which referred or on the floor of the house in which the bill is called up for final passage if no objection to it is made at the time such action is taken.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall prohibit a committee to which a bill is referred or the house in which the bill is being considered from suspending the requirement of the filing of a fiscal impact statement on any such bill in the same manner as provided for the suspension of the rules in the house in which the bill is being considered.

       10-3-318. Review of occupational authorizations and occupational entities — Findings and intent — Definitions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and determines that it is in the best interest of this state to conduct a periodic comprehensive review of all occupational authorizations and the occupational entities that issue them.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the General Assembly to determine and implement the least restrictive form of occupational authorization to protect consumers from significant and substantiated harms to public health and safety.
     </p>
     <p>
      The scope of practice for the occupation or profession; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether a significant and substantiated exposure to antitrust litigation under any existing occupational regulation and under any proposed occupational reform exists; and
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Legislative Council is not required to recommend any legislative reform for any particular occupational authorization or occupational entity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Legislative Council may:
     </p>
     <p>
      Establish or utilize one (1) or more subcommittees to assist in its duties under this section;
     </p>
     <p>
      Assign information filed with the Legislative Council under this section to one (1) or more subcommittees of the Legislative Council, including without limitation a subcommittee created under subdivision (d)(2)(A) of this section; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Delegate its duties under this section to one (1) or more subcommittees of the Legislative Council, subject to final review and approval of the Legislative Council.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Legislative Council determines that it is necessary, the Legislative Council may contract with consultants to assist in the duties assigned under this section or request the staff of Arkansas Legislative Audit to assist in the duties assigned under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)The Legislative Council shall analyze whether consumers can be sufficiently protected by competition, the reputations of occupational practitioners, private ratings and reviews, private certification, voluntary bonding, and voluntary insurance.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Legislative Council finds substantiated evidence of significant harm arising from:
     </p>
     <p>
      (i)Contractual disputes, including pricing disputes, the Legislative Council may recommend enacting legislation allowing lawsuits in small claims court or district court to remedy a specific consumer harm.
     </p>
     <p>
      A cause of action described in subdivision (e)(2)(A)(i) of this section may provide for reimbursement of attorney's fees or court costs if a consumer claim is successful;
     </p>
     <p>
      Fraud, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation strengthening powers under the deceptive trade practices laws or requiring disclosures to reduce misleading attributes of the specific good or service;
     </p>
     <p>
      General health and safety, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation enacting a law or rule that regulates the related process or requires a business license;
     </p>
     <p>
      Unclean facilities, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation requiring periodic facility inspections;
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure of an occupational licensee to complete a contract fully or comply with standards, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation requiring the occupational licensee to be bonded;
     </p>
     <p>
      Lack of protection for a person who is not a party to a contract between an occupational licensee and a consumer, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation requiring the occupational licensee to have insurance;
     </p>
     <p>
      Transactions with transient, out-of-state, or fly-by-night occupational licensees, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation requiring the occupational licensee to register the business with the Secretary of State;
     </p>
     <p>
      Shortfalls or lack of knowledge about the good or service among consumers relative to the occupational practitioner's knowledge, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation enacting government-required certification or other occupational authorization;
     </p>
     <p>
      Systematic information shortfall in which a reasonable consumer of a service is permanently unable to distinguish between the quality of occupational licensees and an absence of guidance to the consumers, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation enacting or maintaining an occupational authorization; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Multiple areas listed in subdivisions (e)(2)(A)-(I) of this section, the Legislative Council may recommend legislation with a combination of occupational authorization, including regulation with a private remedy, third-party or consumer-created ratings and reviews, or private certification.
     </p>

If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

      Acts 2005, No. 2201, § 12: Apr. 13, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee and the Division of Legislative Audit provide essential auditing and investigative services to the General Assembly and the State of Arkansas; that to avoid confusion, the General Assembly finds it is necessary to combine the Arkansas Code provisions concerning the Division of Legislative Audit and the local audit section of the division in one Arkansas Code chapter; that to avoid certain undue hardships on public entities of the state, it is also necessary for the General Assembly to provide a basis of financial statement presentation for certain public entities; that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement on Auditing Standards Number 99 regarding the detection of fraud requires auditors to document unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in their working papers; and that this act is immediately necessary because the General Assembly finds that the public disclosure of such unsubstantiated allegations do not serve a public purpose and may cause irreparable harm to innocent individuals and public employees. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2005.”

       Publisher's Notes.
      </b>
      This section refers to the allocation of space to various governmental entities as they existed at the time of its enactment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Division of Purchasing probably refers to the Purchasing Division of the State Administration Department. Acts 1971, No. 38, § 5, in part, transferred the State Administration Department to the Department of Finance and Administration. Acts 1979, No. 482, § 13, created the Office of State Purchasing within the Department of Finance and Administration.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Commerce was abolished by Acts 1983, No. 691, § 1. That section further provided that the various departments, agencies, boards, commissions, programs, and services transferred to the Department of Commerce as enumerated in the act would be detached from the department and restored, as of July 1, 1983, to the status in which each such department, agency, etc., existed prior to the passage of Acts 1971, No. 38, or prior to its transfer to the Department of Commerce by acts subsequent to Acts 1971, No. 38. Acts 1983, No. 691, § 17, provided, in part, that any program, function, or duty then being performed by or within the Department of Commerce which was not specifically detached therefrom under the provisions of the act would be performed by the detached agency, department, board, or commission to which it was assigned within the Department of Commerce; if the program, function, or duty was not specifically assigned to an agency, department, board, or commission which was detached under the provisions of the act the Governor could, by proclamation, transfer and allocate the program, function, or duty to the appropriate state agency, as determined by the Governor, for its administration.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Accounting Division of the Department of Finance and Administration referred to in subdivision (3) of this section, and the Budget Division of the Department of Finance and Administration referred to in subdivision (4) of this section, probably refer to the Budget and Accounting Division of the Department of Finance and Administration.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director referred to in subdivision (4) is an apparent reference to the Director of the Department of Finance and Administration.

       10-3-1323. Compliance with child welfare reform.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the requirements with which the state must comply pursuant to the consent decree from Angela R., et al. v. Bill Clinton, et al. and the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document demand close observation and study; that the future of the state's children and youth relies heavily on compliance with the decree; that the financial security of the state is in jeopardy if the state has difficulty or is unable to comply with the consent decree because of the voluminous number of lawsuits that could ensue; that the state has a responsibility to protect children and youth from harm and ensure their healthy development; that the Child Welfare Compliance and Oversight Committee will cease to exist on December 31, 1994; that in order to protect the interests of the state, it is crucial that oversight of child welfare issues continue; that oversight by a committee that focuses specifically on problems relating to children and youth would be the most advantageous manner of monitoring compliance with the consent decree and related problems. Therefore, it is declared to be the intent of the General Assembly to require the Senate Interim Committee on Children and Youth to monitor compliance with the consent decree, to report annually regarding compliance, and to review all bills pertaining to the safety, health, mental health, development, and problems of children and youth.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Senate Interim Committee on Children and Youth shall make a report at least annually regarding the state's compliance with the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document and review all bills pertaining to the safety, health, mental health, development, and problems of children and youth. The report shall be made available to all members of the General Assembly.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act affects the method of selection of alternate members of the Legislative Council and Legislative Joint Auditing Committee and that this act is immediately necessary for proper continuity and efficiency in State government. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Acts 2001, No. 160, § 2: Feb. 8, 2001. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-third General Assembly that this act modifies the composition of the Joint Committee on Economic and Tax Policy; that unless this emergency clause is adopted, this act will not become effective until ninety days after the adjournment of this regular session; that the committee will likely have business to conduct prior to the expiration of that ninety-day period; and that there is a necessity for continuity of committee membership during the interim between sessions. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

      Acts 2005, No. 1981, § 4: Apr. 11, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the State of Arkansas has been disadvantaged in its ability to effectively compete for large economic development projects due to its inability to quickly raise revenues through the issuance of general obligation bonds; that attracting a project would significantly benefit the economic development of the state by providing increased payrolls, job opportunities, and tax income; that the citizens of the State of Arkansas recognized the missed opportunities caused by this competitive disadvantage through their overwhelming approval of Amendment 82; and that this act is immediately necessary in order to effectuate the will of the people and position the State of Arkansas to act expeditiously in securing a project in the state. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2017.”

      In November, 1982, the Little Rock School District filed suit against the Pulaski County Special School District, the North Little Rock School District, the State of Arkansas, and the State Board of Education alleging actions by officials resulting in the segregation of schools in the Little Rock district. Little Rock School District v. Pulaski County School District No. 1, et. al., Docket No. LR-C-82-866. In December, 1989, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Henry Woods, J., rejected the settlement plan submitted (726 F. Supp. 1544 (E.D. Ark. 1989)). The court of appeals reversed, holding the settlement plan should have been approved (921 F.2d 1371 (8th Cir. 1990)). On remand (769 F. Supp. 1483 (E.D. Ark. 1991)) the agreement was again rejected and the appeal therefrom vacated (949 F.2d 253 (8th Cir. Ark. 1991)).

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      (1)If an audit report presented to the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee or the appropriate standing subcommittee of the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee reflects evidence of apparent unauthorized disbursements or unaccounted-for funds or property by a public official or employee, the Legislative Auditor shall promptly report the transactions in writing to the prosecuting attorney for the county in which the entity of the state or the political subdivision of the state is located, the Governor, the appropriate executive official or officials affected thereby, and the governing body of the entity of the state or political subdivision of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the findings relate to an entity of the state, the Legislative Auditor shall also report the findings to the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.

      (1)While the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee is not established as an agency to effect through its own direct action the correction of improper practices of financial administration or the inadequacy of fiscal records, the prosecution of defaulting public officials, or the improvement of accounting systems in any entity of the state or political subdivision of the state, it is nevertheless determined that the action or nonaction on the part of the appropriate public officials in respect to the correction of the matters when called to their attention or in respect to the institution of criminal proceedings where proper, has pertinent bearing upon the question of the necessity for future remedial legislation.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is for this reason that the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee is authorized to inform public officials to the extent provided by law of the findings of the Legislative Auditor in respect to any such matters.

     <p>
      (1)If the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee determines that an entity of the state or a political subdivision of the state has not corrected the deficiencies noted in one (1) or more previous reports, the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee may request the prosecuting attorney of the judicial district in which the entity of the state or the political subdivision of the state is located to take appropriate action to assure that the records of the entity of the state or the political subdivision of the state are maintained in accordance with law.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the prosecuting attorney fails or refuses to take appropriate action within a reasonable time after receipt of notice from the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee that an entity of the state or a political subdivision of the state is not maintaining its records in substantial compliance with law, the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee may request the Attorney General to take such appropriate action as may be necessary to assure that the records of the entity of the state or political subdivision of the state are maintained in compliance with law.

      (1)By June 30 of each year, the Attorney General and each prosecuting attorney to whom the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee or the Legislative Auditor has reported a matter under this section shall file with the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee a disposition report on the status of the matters that have not been previously reported as resolved to the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee.

        The 1977 regular session of the General Assembly enacted a “sunset law” Acts 1977, No. 100, which provided for review, and possible termination, of numerous state agencies. This act was amended and supplemented by legislation in succeeding sessions through 1983. All continuations and terminations mandated by these acts are now complete and are reflected in this Code. The sunset laws are set out below for the convenience of users of this Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        SECTION 1. INTENT. The General Assembly hereby determines that State Government actions have produced a substantial increase in the number of agencies, departments, boards, commissions, institutions, and programs of this State, growth of pre-existing programs, and the proliferation of rules and regulations, and that this whole process developed without sufficient legislative oversight, regulatory accountability, or a system of checks and balances. The General Assembly further determines that by establishing a system for the termination, study, review, continuation, or re-establishment of such agencies, it will be in a better position to evaluate the need for the continued existence of existing and future agencies, departments, boards, commissions, institutions, and programs of the State Government.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is further the intention of the General Assembly to establish an orderly schedule for the termination of all existing State agencies, during a six-year period, but to make provision for legislative review by the Joint Interim Committees of the Arkansas General Assembly, including the holding of public hearings, to enable the General Assembly to have the benefit of recommendations for the continuation of those State agencies which are deemed to be essential for the necessary and efficient operation of Government, prior to the termination thereof.

      Section 7. The Division of Legislative Audit shall cooperate with the various Joint Interim Committees in making performance audits and/or providing summary audit information that may be requested by the several Joint Interim Committees in connection with their study and review of the various State agencies enumerated in Sections 3 through 5 of this Act. Each Joint Interim Committee requesting performance audits shall submit its request to the Legislative Auditor, and if the Legislative Auditor determines that there are more requests for performance audits than can be undertaken and completed by the available Auditing staff, he shall submit such request to the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee, and said Committee shall instruct the Legislative Auditor with respect to the performance audits to be undertaken and the priorities thereof. Upon completion of performance audits and/or summary audit reports requested by the respective Joint Interim Committees, the Division of Legislative Audit shall present copies thereof to the appropriate Joint Interim Committee which has the State agency under review, and shall make itself available to such Committee for the purpose of reviewing the audit reports and/or information.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Joint Interim Committees to which State agencies are referred for review under the provisions of this Act shall specifically request in writing a report from the Governor containing his recommendations for continuation, abolition, or modification of each of the State agencies and the divisions and programs thereof, which are under consideration by the Joint Interim Committees, failure by the Governor to file such a report with the Committees shall not prohibit the Committees from proceeding with their duties under this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      SECTION 2. EMERGENCY. It is hereby found and determined that Act 100 of 1977 mandated the Division of Legislative Audit to make performance audits of the various State agencies to be reviewed by the several Joint Interim Committees under the provisions of said Act 100; that approximately one hundred twenty (120) State agencies are to be reviewed by the Joint Interim Committees during the 1977-78 biennium, and it will be impossible for the staff of the Division of Legislative Audit to make performance audits of each of these agencies; and that the immediate passage of this Act is necessary to amend Section 7 of Act 100 of 1977 to permit the Division of Legislative Audit to make performance audits when requested by the respective Joint Interim Committees, and to furnish other audit information upon request, yet relieving the Division of Legislative Audit of the responsibility of making performance audits on all such agencies; and that the immediate passage of this Act is necessary to accomplish such purpose and to expedite the work of the Joint Interim Committees during the current biennium. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.

     <p>
      SECTION 1. PURPOSE. In the passage of this Act, the General Assembly is cognizant of the intent of Section 3 of Act 100 of 1977, which provided for the termination of a number of State agencies on June 30, 1979, unless studies of said State agencies by Joint Interim Committees of the General Assembly, who were assigned in said Section 3 to make “Sunset reviews” of said agencies, determine that the continuation of certain said State agencies is in the public interest. During the interim between the adoption of Act 100 of 1977, and the convening of the 1979 Regular Session of the General Assembly, the respective Joint Interim Committees of the General Assembly have made studies and review of the purposes, activities, justifications, and needs for each of the State agencies enumerated in Section 3 of 1977, and have recommended the continuation of a number of said State agencies. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Act to provide for the continuation of certain of said State agencies, as enumerated in this Act, subsequent to June 30, 1979, and to provide that the provisions of Section 3 of Act 100 of 1977, which would have provided for the termination of the State agencies enumerated herein on June 30, 1979, shall be of no effect, and that said State agencies be continued, and shall continue to function the same as if the provisions of Section 3 of Act 100 of 1979, which provided for their termination, had never been enacted.
     </p>
     <p>
      SECTION 2. The following State agencies which under the provisions of Section 3 of Act 100 of 1977, were scheduled to terminate on June 30, 1979, are hereby continued, and said State agencies shall continue to function, and shall perform the respective powers, functions and duties assigned to them by law from and after June 30, 1979, the same as they would have functioned if Section 3 of Act 100 of 1977 had never been enacted:

It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Section 3 of Act 100 of 1977 provided for the termination of a number of State Agencies and programs to be effective on June 30, 1979, that it was the intention of said Act that each of said agencies and programs would be reviewed in the interim between the recess and adjournment and the convening of the 72nd General Assembly by the Legislative Joint Interim Committees of the General Assembly to evaluate the purposes, duties and accomplishments of said agencies and programs with the view that the General Assembly would take action to restore and continue those agencies and programs that were needed in the public interests, that other agencies and programs would be reorganized and that other agencies and programs would be allowed to terminate as provided by Act 100 of 1977; and, as a result of said studies during the interim prior to the convening of the 72nd General Assembly recommendations have been made to restore and continue the operations of numerous agencies and programs which were to terminate on June 30, 1979, and recommendations were made that other agencies and programs be extended for two more years for further study and to terminate on June 30, 1981 unless restored and continued by the 73rd General Assembly; that the immediate passage of this Act is necessary to restore and continue the various agencies and programs identified in this Act and that said action should be taken prior to June 30, 1979, at which time said agencies would be terminated under the provisions of Act 100 of 1977, it being the intent of this Act that the agencies and programs defined herein would continue to function. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.

          SECTION 1. PURPOSE. In the passage of this Act, the General Assembly is cognizant of the intent of Section 4 of Act 100 of 1977, Section 3 of Act 683 of 1979 and Section 2 of Act 1021 of 1979, which provided for the termination of a number of state agencies on June 30, 1981 unless studies of said state agencies by joint interim committees of the General Assembly, who were assigned in said Acts to make “Sunset reviews” of said agencies, determine that the continuation of certain of said state agencies is in the public interest. During the interim between the adoption of Act 100 of 1977, Act 683 of 1979 and Act 1021 of 1979, and the convening of the 1981 Regular Session of the General Assembly, the respective joint interim committees of the General Assembly have made studies and review of the purposes, activities, justifications, and needs for each of the state agencies enumerated in Section 4 of Act 100 of 1977, Section 3 of Act 683 of 1979 and Section 2 of Act 1021 of 1979, and have recommended the continuation of a number of said state agencies. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Act to provide for the continuation of certain of said state agencies, as enumerated in this Act, subsequent to June 30, 1981, and to provide that the provisions of Section 4 of Act 100 of 1977, Section 3 of Act 683 of 1979, and Section 2 of Act 1021 of 1979, which would have provided for the termination of the state agencies enumerated herein on June 30, 1981, shall be of no effect, and that said state agencies be continued, and shall continue to function the same as if the provisions of Section 4 of Act 100 of 1977, Section 3 of Act 683 of 1979 and Section 2 of Act 1021 of 1979, which provided for their termination, had never been enacted.
         </p>
         <p>
          SECTION 2. The following state agencies which under the provisions of Section 4 of Act 100 of 1977, Section 3 of Act 683 of 1979 and Section 2 of Act 1021 of 1979, were scheduled to terminate on June 30, 1981, are hereby continued, and said state agencies shall continue to function, and shall perform the respective powers, functions and duties assigned to them by law from and after June 30, 1981, the same as they would have functioned if Section 4 of Act 100 of 1977, Section 3 of Act 683 of 1979 and Section 2 of Act 1021 of 1979 had never been enacted:

         <p>
          SECTION 1. PURPOSE. In the passage of this Act, the General Assembly is cognizant of the intent of Section 5 of Act 100 of 1977 and Section 3 of Act 883 of 1981, which provided for the termination of a number of state agencies on June 30, 1983 unless studies of said state agencies by joint interim committees of the General Assembly, who were assigned in said Acts to make “Sunset reviews” of said agencies, determine that the continuation of certain of said state agencies is in the public interest. During the interim between the adoption of Act 100 of 1977, and Act 883 of 1981, and the convening of the 1983 Regular Session of the General Assembly, the respective joint interim committees of the General Assembly have made studies and review of the purposes, activities, justifications, and needs for each of the state agencies enumerated in Section 5 of Act 100 of 1977, Section 3 of Act 883 of 1981, and have recommended the continuation of a number of said state agencies in their present form. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Act to provide for the continuation of certain state agencies, subsequent to June 30, 1981, and to provide that the provisions of Section 5 of Act 100 of 1977, and Section 3 of Act 883 of 1981, which would have provided for the termination of the state agencies enumerated herein on June 30, 1983, shall be of no effect, and that said state agencies be continued in their present form and under their present names, and such state agencies or their successor agencies shall continue to function the same as if the provisions of Act 100 of 1977 and Section 3 of Act 883 of 1981, which provided for the termination of the state agencies enumerated herein, had never been enacted.
         </p>
         <p>
          SECTION 2. The following state agencies, which under the provisions of Section 5 of Act 100 of 1977 or Section 3 of Act 883 of 1981, were scheduled to terminate on June 30, 1983, are hereby continued in their present form and under their present names, and said state agencies, or their successor agencies, shall continue to function and shall perform the respective powers, functions, and duties assigned to them by law from and after June 30, 1983, the same as they would have functioned if Act 100 of 1977 and Section 3 of Act 883 of 1981 had never been enacted:
         </p>
         <p>
          SECTION 3. This Act shall not have the effect of recreating any agency which has been abolished before the effective date of this Act.
         </p>
         <p>
          SECTION 4. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are hereby repealed.
         </p>
         <p>
          SECTION 5. EMERGENCY CLAUSE.
