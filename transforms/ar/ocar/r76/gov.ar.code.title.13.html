      <b>
       ARTICLE I. Policy and Purpose.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis; and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states, and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provisions of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.

Any such programs, services, or arrangements may include provision for the exercise on a cooperative or joint basis of any power exercisable by an interstate library district, and an agreement embodying any such program, service, or arrangement shall contain provision covering the subjects detailed in Article VI of this compact for interstate library agreements.

In order to keep the dance hall warm, a large barrel of kerosene was placed in the center of the room and was filled about half-way with fuel.

King realized that he had left his guitar, a Gibson acoustic, at the mercy of the inferno. Back inside the collapsing building he went to rescue his guitar, almost losing his life in the process.

      State government provides vital functions that impact the lives of Arkansas citizens on a daily basis;

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Issues such as the administrative organization of a governmental entity, the appointment structure of a governmental entity's governing board, and extraneous duties assigned to governmental entities hamper the operation of state government and result in unnecessary expenses and delays in the provision of state services.

      It is the intent of this act to amend provisions of law applicable to certain agencies, task forces, committees, and commission to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the operations of state government as a whole.”

Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

      Acts 2011, No. 679, § 3, provided:
     </p>
     <p>
      “FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      The United States Marshals have played a significant role in the settlement of the State of Arkansas and the United States;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      The United States Marshals Service, established on September 24, 1789, as part of the Judiciary Act that was the first bill passed in Congress and signed into law by George Washington, is the oldest federal law enforcement agency in the nation;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Although originally established to protect the judiciary, the United States Marshals were often called the other duties as assigned agency because of their broad powers as evidenced by their call in 1794 to protect tax collectors during the Whiskey Rebellion and responsibility for enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      Today, there are 94 United States Marshals, one for each federal district, who continue to be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States, and numerous Deputy Marshals responsible for carrying out the day-to-day duties of the United States Marshals Service as civil servants;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Because of the over two hundred (200) year honorable history of the United States Marshals Service, the cultural and economic development of this state would benefit by the construction, operation, and maintenance of a museum honoring the United States Marshals Service; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Since there currently is not a museum in the country honoring the United States Marshals Service, having the only museum dedicated to the oldest federal law enforcement agency in the nation would bring national and regional attention to the state, increase tourism, create jobs, promote economic and cultural development, and promote the planning and development of infrastructure and resources to support the increased activity, all of which would have a substantial positive impact on the state as a whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      The General Assembly further finds and determines that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      The construction, development, and maintenance of museums devoted to honoring the historical significance of the United States Marshals Service are noble, public purposes that will provide educational opportunities for all citizens in the State of Arkansas, promote industry and tourism, and provide economic development to cities and towns within the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Any funds obtained from a state or local government, a public, private, or nonprofit entity, or an individual intended to assist in the construction, development, or maintenance of a United States Marshals museum or exhibit would inure to the benefit of the people of this State by defraying development and operational costs and expenses; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      All funding provided for the construction, development, or maintenance of a United States Marshals museum or exhibit is found to be for a public purpose benefitting the public good and that any funds given, allocated, or loaned to a United States Marshals museum or exhibit by any state or local government is conclusively presumed to be for public uses and purposes.

      The development of the Arkansas Delta was marked by the diversity of ethnic groups who were interdependent within the agricultural economy. Interpretation of the development of this area is important both to understanding the past and its effects on the future and to the economic development of the area through increased tourism.

     <p>
      <b>

     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, Arkansas is a state rich in archeological resources which, if properly excavated, catalogued and preserved, can add immeasurably to the knowledge of our history and our heritage; and

      “Whereas, the preservation of our antiquities is of value and interest not only to the citizens of Arkansas but to persons from other states who visit Arkansas as well; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, many historic sites and archeological treasures are either unsurveyed and undiscovered, due to lack of a coordinated and adequate program, or are, in fact, in danger of being lost to posterity by reason of unscientific exploitation, highway construction, flooding from reservoirs in connection with building of dams, and by other means:
     </p>

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety, and welfare shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and declared by the General Assembly that the historic sites, buildings and objects which are now marked for preservation by the state are subject to disintegration and casualty, with resulting irreparable loss, which can best be avoided through a commission having comprehensive and uniform jurisdiction, and that other historic sites, buildings and objects which are or may become worthy of preservation cannot be reasonably acquired for the purpose because of the absence of a commission charged with the duty of ascertaining their exceptional value; hence, this act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.”

Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)(A)
      </b>
      Be a trail or route established by historic use and shall be historically significant as a result of that historic use.

      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      A route shall not be required to exist as a discernible trail to qualify as a heritage trail, but its location shall be sufficiently known to permit evaluation of historical interest potential;

     <p>
      <b>
       (2)(A)
      </b>
      Accurately follow the historic route with some deviations as necessary to avoid difficult routing through subsequent development or to enhance the public's enjoyment of the heritage trail.

     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      Trail segments no longer possible to travel by trail due to subsequent development as motorized transportation routes may be designated and marked as segments that link to the historic trail;
