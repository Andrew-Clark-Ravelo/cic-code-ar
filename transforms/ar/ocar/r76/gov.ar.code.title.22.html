       (a)
      </b>
      As used in this section, “public school system” means any school system, district, college, or university in the State of Arkansas which is supported wholly or in part by tax dollars, whether federal, state, or local.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      No title or right of possession to any public school system property, or any portion thereof, shall or can be acquired by adverse possession or adverse occupancy thereof. The right of the public school system or of the proper school authorities of any public school system shall not be defeated in any action or proceeding by reason of adverse possession or adverse occupancy of any public school system property, or any portion thereof, where the parties claiming such adverse possession commence legal action after January 1, 1983. This section is to serve as legal notice to such parties that claims to adverse possession of public school properties commenced after January 1, 1983, shall be unwarranted and ineffective, and those claims shall be dismissed by the appropriate court.

     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      It is the intent of the General Assembly that state agencies be housed, whenever possible, in public buildings as soon as space and facilities in public buildings are available and that the acquisition and granting of leasehold interests in land be regulated and supervised by the Building Authority Division. The division and all other state agencies are authorized and directed to implement that intent as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)(A)
      </b>
      The division is given the authority and responsibility to act as the leasing agent for all state agencies and component parts thereof, acting either as lessor or lessee, and to act as the agent for leasing space in all public buildings located in the State of Arkansas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      In addition, the division is given the authority and responsibility to act as the leasing agent for any nonagency state entity if requested in writing by a nonagency state entity to act in that manner and if the responsibility for the services is accepted in writing by the division.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)(i)
      </b>
      After July 1, 1975, no state agency shall enter into or renew or otherwise negotiate a lease between itself as lessor or lessee and a nongovernmental or other government lessor or lessee.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (ii)
      </b>
      The division shall determine the needs of the state agency, locate appropriate rental space, and act as the agent for the state agency in negotiating the lease for the rental space;

     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      All state agencies and component parts thereof, when requested by the division, shall execute and enter into leases with the division for the leasing or renting of space and facilities in any public buildings. The leases may be upon such conditions, for such terms, for such rentals, and may contain such other provisions that the Department of Transformation and Shared Services and the state agency involved determine to be appropriate and in the best interests of all concerned;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      Any state agency or component part thereof needing new or additional space shall notify the division, and the division shall prepare a lease for the space based upon the standards and criteria as adopted by the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and Shared Services. If space is available in a public building, the lease will be negotiated for placement in the public building;

      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      If the Real Estate Services Section of the Building Authority Division determines that adequate space is not available in public buildings, the Real Estate Services Section of the Building Authority Division shall act as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section to obtain adequate space from a privately owned facility;

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (ii)

       (B)
      </b>
      In cities and towns having a population of less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) according to the last federal decennial census, for those state agencies providing direct public access services, preference shall be granted to lease space located in existing buildings in the central business district, as defined by the locality's planning commission, or, in the absence thereof, by the municipality's governing body, except in cases where location within the central business district would impair or restrict the intent of the services being provided to the public or the state's proximity to other state or nongovernmental services or where rental rates justify other locations;

       (6)

      Leases as to office space, buildings, structures, parking lots, and grounds from private individuals, firms, and corporations by state agencies and component parts thereof shall be on a standard lease form approved by the secretary.

      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      The Ten Commandments, found in the Bible at Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21, are an important component of the moral foundation of the laws and legal system of the United States of America and of the State of Arkansas;

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      The Ten Commandments represent a philosophy of government held by many of the founders of this nation and by many Arkansans and other Americans today, that God has ordained civil government and has delegated limited authority to civil government, that God has limited the authority of civil government, and that God has endowed people with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      In order that they may understand and appreciate the basic principles of the American system of government, the people of the United States of America and of the State of Arkansas need to identify the Ten Commandments, one of many sources, as influencing the development of what has become modern law; and
     </p>

      The placing of a monument to the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol would help the people of the United States and of the State of Arkansas to know the Ten Commandments as the moral foundation of the law.”

      The next scene indicates the youth of the United States who volunteer to serve and protect us and give others a freedom they never knew.

     <p>
      Acts 1953, No. 289, § 3: approved Mar. 11, 1953. Emergency clause provided: “Because of the unusually large amount of expense involved and the short time within which the Governor had to prepare for the inauguration, and due to the pressure of business as a result of the convening of the General Assembly, it has been impossible for the Governor to account for all items of expense in the operation of the Governor's Mansion, and for such reasons the Governor shall withdraw from the maintenance appropriation account the proportionate monthly allotment, effective as of January 13, 1953, taking into consideration, however, all vouchers heretofore issued. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage.”

      Acts 1973, No. 203, § 7: Mar. 2, 1973; Acts 1973, No. 400, § 7: Mar. 20, 1973. Emergency clauses provided: “The General Assembly finds that the Governor's Mansion is in immediate need of repair and renovation, and that the immediate assistance of the Commission created hereby is necessary in aid of such improvements. Accordingly, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act, being necessary for the public peace, health, and safety, shall be effective immediately upon its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1992 (2nd Ex. Sess.), No. 1, § 6: Dec. 18, 1992. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Eighth General Assembly meeting in Second Extraordinary Session, that the Governor of the State of Arkansas has been elected to serve as President of the United States of America and will be sworn into that office on January 20, 1993; and that the State Supreme Court has determined the lawful succession to fill the office of Governor when it is vacant; and that the urgent problems confronting the State require the prompt and orderly implementation of this succession (which does not involve the habitation of the Mansion); and that his continued residence in the Governor's Mansion is necessary to provide for a smooth and effective transition between governors. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after the date of its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      The Arkansas Justice Building was constructed primarily to house the higher appellate courts and that other agencies were permitted to occupy portions of the building only because the space was not needed by the courts at that time;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      Since construction of the building, the electors of the state authorized the establishment of a new appellate court, the Court of Appeals;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      The Court of Appeals is in urgent need of additional space in the Arkansas Justice Building in order to perform its responsibilities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (D)
      </b>
      It is essential that the additional space to be provided the Court of Appeals is contiguous to the space now assigned to that court.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent of this section to establish specific priorities for use of space in the Arkansas Justice Building and to specifically authorize the Building Authority Division of the Department of Finance and Administration to allocate space in the Arkansas Justice Building in accordance with those priorities to assure that the appellate courts and the services and facilities essential to the effective and efficient operation of the courts, such as library facilities, are given first priority in the use of space in the building.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)(1)
      </b>
      Space in the Arkansas Justice Building shall be allocated by the division, after seeking the advice of the Joint Interim Committee on Legislative Facilities, to the following courts, library, and offices in the order of priority listed:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>

      The Administrative Office of the Courts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The space requirements of each court, library, or office listed in this subsection must be adequately met before any space is allocated to any other office or agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      If the space requirements of the courts, library, and offices listed in subsection (b) of this section are adequately met, the division, after seeking the advice of the Joint Interim Committee on Legislative Facilities, may allocate any additional space to any other offices or agencies it deems appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      The division shall allocate space in accordance with the priorities prescribed in this section as soon as practicable after April 3, 1985, in order that the additional space allocated to the courts, library, and offices enumerated in this section shall be available on or before July 1, 1985.

      The Building Authority Division shall provide adequate facilities for those agencies located in the Capitol Mall area. The services provided by these agencies are varied. Parking spaces for these tenants have not kept up with current growth, thereby diminishing effective services provided by these agencies. The public access to the Capitol Mall area has been diminished by the lack of adequate parking. The construction of a parking deck facility, surface parking, and street improvements will help to alleviate such diminished services and lack of access.

       Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment for landowner and dismissing parks department's condemnation complaint because the department failed to follow the procedures set forth in this section for acquiring park lands, such as receiving the Governor's written approval; further, Acts 2001, No. 1102, and Acts 2003, No. 1605, the acts funding the land acquisition, were not more specific legislation that negated the procedures in this section, rather, the Acts were general appropriation provisions that provided the funding mechanisms for the department to acquire additional lands, while this section established the procedures to be followed.

      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      The Arkansas Department of Transportation shall determine those state highway rights-of-way that are wider than necessary for highway purposes and those borrow pits, dirt pits, and other highway-related lands owned by the state or the department that could be used to produce pine timber for pulpwood or other uses and shall submit a listing of these areas to the Arkansas Forestry Commission which shall inspect the areas to determine if they are suitable for planting and growing pine.

     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      If the department and the Arkansas Forestry Commission determine that there are enough such areas to make it feasible to initiate a program for planting and producing pine thereon, the two agencies shall cooperatively initiate and maintain such program as soon as practicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      When a program authorized by this section is initiated, the Arkansas Forestry Commission shall have the responsibility for all planting and management under the program and for applying appropriate silvicultural practices thereto, including the harvesting and marketing of wood products so produced.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      If the department determines that traffic safety demands that different thinning practices than those normally applied in the management of such timber are required to accommodate highway safety, the Arkansas Forestry Commission shall make arrangements for thinning of the timber growth along the rights-of-way in the manner and to the extent directed by the State Highway Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)
      </b>
      When a program authorized by this section is initiated, the net proceeds derived from the sale of pine grown on the state highway rights-of-way or other highway-related areas owned by the state or the department shall be deposited into the State Treasury as special revenues. Fifty percent (50%) thereof shall be credited to the State Highway and Transportation Department Fund, and fifty percent (50%) thereof shall be credited to the State Forestry Fund.

       Limited liability corporation contended that the state had no interest in property at issue, which was purchased at a tax sale, because a suit to quiet title in state property could only be commenced by the Attorney General or an assistant attorney appointed by the Governor, pursuant to this section.

       Where a change in the course of a navigable river caused an island to form in front of plaintiff's land or within his original boundaries, which by accretion extended in front of the defendant's land and within his original boundaries, plaintiff's title was limited to the part of the island within his original boundaries.

      <p>
       When the formation begins with a bar or an island detached and away from the shore, and by gradual filling in by deposit, or by gradual recession of the water, the space between bar or island and mainland is joined together, it is not an accretion to the mainland in a legal sense, and does not thereby become the property of the owner of the mainland.

      The State of Arkansas quitclaims, to the owners of adjacent lands, title to the streambed of the Mulberry River, excluding oil, gas, and other mineral rights underlying the stream, to the center of the stream. However, the state retains an easement to run with the land for free passage by the public over the land by canoe, boat, other watercraft, swimming, wading, or walking, and for fishing, recreation, travel, commerce, and other purposes.

      No affirmative action shall be required by the mineral owner or lessee of the State of Arkansas to enable the mineral owner or lessee to retain ownership of or leasehold interest in the minerals under the bed of the Mulberry River.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)(A)
      </b>
      If the mineral owner or lessee desires record proof of his or her continued ownership of the oil, gas, and other minerals, he or she may file an application with the Commissioner of State Lands for a quitclaim deed covering the oil, gas, and other minerals under the bed of the river.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>

      In the alternative, the mineral owner may file with his or her application a deposit of the estimated cost of a survey, and the Commissioner of State Lands shall direct the county surveyor of the county in which the lands are located, or some other competent surveyor, to make an accurate survey of the lands and to plat them in reference to the survey of adjacent lands and file the survey and plat in the office of the Commissioner of State Lands.

       22-5-815. Mineral rights in lands covered by artificially created navigable waters.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      The State of Arkansas shall not acquire title to the oil, gas, and other minerals in and under lands covered by navigable waters artificially created by agencies of the United States or the State of Arkansas in any instance where the underlying minerals are not purchased or condemned and compensation paid therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      The private ownership of the oil, gas, and other minerals in and under lands covered by artificially created navigable waters as established by this section shall be subservient to, and the exercise of rights of extraction and removal thereof shall not be permitted to interfere with or impair, the rights of public navigation, transportation, fishing, and recreation in and upon such navigable waters.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      No affirmative action shall be required by the mineral owner or the State of Arkansas to enable the mineral owner to retain ownership of the minerals in and under the artificially inundated lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)(1)
      </b>
      If the mineral owner desires record proof of his or her continued ownership of the minerals, he or she may file an application with the Commissioner of State Lands for a quitclaim deed covering the minerals in and under the inundated lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      If the inundated lands have been surveyed and platted by an agency of the United States or the State of Arkansas, the mineral owner may furnish a copy of the survey and plat to the Commissioner of State Lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If the survey and plat sufficiently identify the land, no further survey shall be required.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)(1)
      </b>
      In the alternative, the mineral owner may file a deposit of the estimated cost of a survey with his or her application, and the Commissioner of State Lands shall direct the county surveyor of the county in which the lands are located, or some other competent surveyor, to make an accurate survey of the lands and to plat them in reference to the survey of adjacent lands and file the survey and plat in the office of the Commissioner of State Lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Upon the filing of the survey and plat, the Commissioner of State Lands shall pay for the cost of the survey out of the money deposited as provided in subdivision (e)(1) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If the deposit is insufficient for that purpose, the Commissioner of State Lands may require an additional deposit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      If any deposited funds remain after payment, they shall be refunded to the depositor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (f)
      </b>
      After the survey and plat of the agency of the United States or the State of Arkansas or the survey and plat of the surveyor selected by the Commissioner of State Lands are filed, the applicant shall file affidavits of at least two (2) competent persons having full personal knowledge of the facts, establishing that the applicant is the present owner of the minerals in and under the lands shown in the survey and that the lands have been inundated without payment of compensation for the minerals by an agency of the United States or the State of Arkansas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (g)
      </b>
      Upon receipt of the survey and affidavits, the Commissioner of State Lands may issue a quitclaim deed to the applicant upon the payment of a deed fee of one dollar ($1.00). The quitclaim deed shall establish that the state has no claim in and makes no claim to the oil, gas, and other minerals in and under the lands described in the survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (h)
      </b>
      The State of Arkansas quitclaims and relinquishes to the previous mineral owner and his or her successors and assigns all of the state's right, title, and interest to the oil, gas, and other minerals in and under lands covered prior to February 23, 1965, by artificially created navigable waters caused by an agency of the United States or the State of Arkansas and for which compensation has not been paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (i)
      </b>
      If the previous mineral owner desires record proof of his or her continued ownership of the minerals, he or she may follow the procedure outlined in this section and obtain a quitclaim deed from the Commissioner of State Lands.

      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      It is the primary purpose and intent of this subchapter that when islands are formed in navigable waters of this state, title to the islands should be retained in the state if the island is appropriate for use by any state agency or may become appropriate for any use by the state and that the islands should be sold by the state only when it is determined that they have no present or future use to the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      It is not the purpose of this subchapter to require any state agency to accept the responsibility and duty for the operation, management, or development of any island but only that appropriate state agencies, as determined by the Commissioner of State Lands, shall have an opportunity to assume control over the islands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      It is also the intent of this subchapter that when any state agency accepts the duties and responsibility of operating, managing, or developing any island, the agency shall have the authority to permit and regulate activities upon the lands, including the cutting of timber. The agency may use or permit the use of the lands for such purposes as it shall deem appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      It is further the intent of this subchapter to establish the policy that all submerged lands following the navigable waterways of this state shall remain in the state domain. “Submerged lands” shall be those lands found at and below the line of ordinary highwater and shall include, but not be limited to, the beds, channels, chutes, and adjoining areas of rivers, lakes, and streams.

      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Upon making the determination, the Commissioner of State Lands shall notify the agency which it finds to be most appropriate to operate and manage the island and shall determine whether that agency is willing to accept the authority and responsibility for operating and managing the island.

       (4)
      </b>
      If the agency so notified does not desire to accept the responsibility and duty to operate and manage the island, it shall notify the Commissioner of State Lands who shall give the state agency which it deems next most appropriate the option of accepting the authority and responsibility of operating and managing the island.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)(1)
      </b>
      When an agency agrees to accept the authority and responsibility of operating and managing an island, the agency shall cause the island to be accurately surveyed, compile field notes, and plat the lands in reference to the adjacent lands by the extension of township, range, and section lines, and the agency shall pay the cost of the survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Upon completion of the survey, a copy shall be filed with the Commissioner of State Lands. Upon payment of one dollar ($1.00) consideration to the Commissioner of State Lands by the agency desiring to accept the authority and responsibility of operating and managing the island, the authority and responsibility shall vest with the agency, and title shall be in the name of the State of Arkansas and held by the Commissioner of State Lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      If the Commissioner of State Lands finds that an island is not appropriate for operation, management, or use by any appropriate state agency and if no state agency is desirous of accepting the responsibility and duty of managing and operating the island, the Commissioner of State Lands may, at his or her discretion and if the Commissioner of State Lands determines that the best interest of the state is being served, retain title to the island in the name of the state, or, alternatively, the Commissioner of State Lands may sell the island in a manner prescribed by subsection (e) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)(1)
      </b>
      Whenever the Commissioner of State Lands finds that any island formed in the navigable waters of this state is not appropriate for use by any state agency and if no state agency is desirous of assuming the responsibility and duty of operating and managing the island, the Commissioner of State Lands may accept applications for purchase of the island.

      <b>
       (c)
      </b>

      Any civil or criminal process lawfully issued by competent authority of this state or any of its subdivisions may be served and executed within the land or other area to the same extent and with the same effect as the process may be served and executed generally within this state, except that the service and execution of process within land or other areas over which the federal government exercises jurisdiction shall be subject to such rules and regulations issued by authorized officers of the federal government, or of any department, independent establishment, or agency thereof, as may be reasonably necessary to prevent interference with the carrying out of federal functions; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      This state shall exercise over the land or other area the same legislative jurisdiction which it exercises over land or other areas generally within this state, except that the United States shall not be required to forego such measure of exclusive legislative jurisdiction as may be vested in or retained by it over the land or other area pursuant to this section, and this state's exercise of jurisdiction shall be without prejudice to the right of the United States to assert and exercise such concurrent legislative jurisdiction as may be vested in or retained by it over the land or other area.

Emergency clause provided: “Since numerous complaints have been made with regard to the manner of letting contracts for construction for the state and local taxing units and it being the belief that passage of this act will result in substantial savings of money to the public, and the possibility of unethical practices will be materially eliminated and this act, being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1957, No. 183, § 2: Mar. 8, 1957. Emergency clause provided: “Because of the large volume of proposed construction by taxing agencies, and the confusion that now exists on a large scale because the general contractor does not have full responsibility for all the work to be performed to the detriment of all concerned, an emergency is therefore declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage and approval by the Governor.”
     </p>

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that many contractors performing construction or repair contracts for public authorities in this state are often subject to undue and unnecessary delay in receiving payment for such contracts upon completion and acceptance thereof; that because of such unnecessary delays in making payment such contractors are subject to additional expense in borrowing funds to pay creditors which was not contemplated at the time the contract was entered into; that in most instances the delay in making payments is not due to the lack of public funds, but is merely the result of carelessness or inaction on the part of the public authority owing the claim; and that the immediate passage of this act is necessary in order to encourage public authorities to make prompt payment of such claims or to permit the contractor to recover interest on the amount unpaid to compensate him for additional expense incurred because of such delay; and that the immediate passage of this act is necessary to correct this situation. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

      Acts 1989, No. 936, § 4: Mar. 24, 1989. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Seventh General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the lack of civil penalties for violations of the public contracting laws reduces the effectiveness of those laws and that the effectiveness of the laws dealing with awarding of public works contracts serves an important public purpose. Therefore, in order to increase the effectiveness of the enforcement of the public works contracting laws, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that under present law it is unclear whether public construction projects conducted by State Building Services or other State agencies are subject to the payment of local construction fees, inspection by local inspectors, local zoning laws and other local regulations; that it is urgent that this matter be clarified immediately in order to protect the State from unnecessary restrictions on State construction projects and should be given effect immediately.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that requirements in plans and specifications which require bidders and suppliers to hold membership in certain professional organizations limit the number of eligible bidders and suppliers for projects; that by requiring bidders and suppliers to hold membership in professional organizations, an entity may increase the possibility of certain bidders and suppliers receiving projects, which is an inequitable outcome; and that the state of Arkansas and its citizens will benefit from enhanced competition for bidders and suppliers on public construction projects. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that an immediate need exists to allow municipal utilities to fulfill their duties to purchase commodities and enter into legal and enforceable contracts for services to maintain and operate utility facilities on federal military installations within the state; that the window of opportunity for municipalities to enter into third party contracts for maintaining and operating utility facilities serving the utility needs of federal military installations is narrow; that the effective operation of federal military installations in the state depends on the maintenance and operation of these utility facilities; and that this act is
   immediately necessary because national security and the general welfare, material wellbeing, and economic stability of the citizens of this state will be furthered by this act. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2015.”

     <p>

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

       Public contractor could assert federal constitutional retaliation claims because a city's rejection of its low bid for a contract pursuant to the “lowest responsible bidder” provisions of subsection (d) and subdivision (j)(6) of this section, had the effect of removing the contractor from the official list of contractors authorized to provide construction services to the city. The contractor's retaliation claims failed, however because the petitioning activity on which its claims were based, namely a prior contract-related arbitration proceeding between it and the city, did not involve a matter of public concern.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)(1)
      </b>
      When the prime contractor makes a definite decision regarding the subcontractors he or she intends to use, he or she shall place the name of each subcontractor in a blank space provided on the form of proposal of his or her bid.

Additional approval must be obtained from the Building Authority Division for capital improvement projects under its jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      The prime contractor shall submit written evidence that the substituted contractor is costing the same amount of money or less and, if costing less, that the savings will be deducted from the total contract of the prime contractor and rebated to the owner.

     <p>
      <b>
       (e)
      </b>
      It shall be mandatory that the mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and roofing subcontractors named on the form of proposal by the prime contractor awarded a contract under the provisions of this subchapter be given contracts by the prime contractor in keeping with their proposals to perform the items for which they were named.

     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The mandatory adherence to competitive bidding of all costs in altering, repairing, or renovating historic sites and structures has resulted in increased costs due to the inability of bidders to accurately determine on the basis of only an external examination of the historic sites and structures the exact quantity of labor, materials, and supplies necessary to meet the restoration standards;

       (2)

      The State of Arkansas would conserve state revenues by giving agencies charged with restoring or maintaining historic properties authority to select the contractors on the basis of the lowest responsible bid price, the bidder's experience in like work, and the techniques he or she proposes to employ, and by giving the agencies authority to reimburse contractors on an actual cost basis for those cost components which cannot be accurately predetermined before undertaking the project; and

Provided, however, projects undertaken by public institutions of higher education exempt from review and approval of the division shall not require review and approval by the secretary.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Ninth General Assembly that subcontractors are not currently required by law to insure their financial responsibility through the posting of a bond with the State of Arkansas. It is not in the public interest to continue to endure the resulting poor quality and workmanship which lead to increased maintenance and replacement costs. This act establishes such a requirement and should be given immediate effect.

       Section 22-9-203 sets forth procedures to be followed in advertising, evaluating, and acting upon bids for specified improvements and, although the section does not address any requirements pertaining to bid bonds or the liability thereunder, it does inferentially require that a bid bond be posted and that the required notice specify the amount thereof, expressed in percentage of the penal sum; because former A.S.A. 1947, § 14-114 (see now this section) addressed the requirements of bid bonds in connection with bids upon public construction contracts and defined the conditions of the bond, surety requirements, and liability under the bond, the two provisions are consistent and can be read together.

     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      If the general contractor requires the subcontractor to provide a bond, the subcontractor shall provide the bond to the general contractor within five (5) days after the award of the contract by the general contractor to the subcontractor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      If the subcontractor fails to provide a payment and performance bond when required by the general contractor, the subcontractor shall lose the bid and shall pay to the general contractor a penalty equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the subcontractor's bid or the difference between the low bid and the next responsible bid and the next responsible low bid, whichever is less, plus cost of recovery of the penalty, including attorney's fees. The purpose of this section is to compensate the general contractor for the difference between the low bid and the next responsible low bid.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that retainage provisions contained in many public construction contracts to be performed in this state are unduly restrictive and create a serious hardship on contractors performing such contracts; that this act is designed to prescribe the relative rights of public agencies and contractors with respect to retainage under public construction contracts, and to thereby provide appropriate protection to public agencies and to contractors entering into contracts for public construction; and that this act should be given effect at the earliest possible date in order to clarify the relative rights of the parties to public construction contracts.

     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      There is a public need for the timely acquisition, design, construction, improvement, renovation, expansion, equipping, maintenance, operation, implementation, and installation of public infrastructure and government facilities within the state that serve a public purpose;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>

      The public need for government facilities and public infrastructure may not be satisfied by existing methods of procurement or funding available to the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      There are inadequate resources to develop public infrastructure and government facilities for the benefit of citizens of the state, and there is demonstrated evidence that public-private partnerships can:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      Promote the timely and cost-efficient development of public infrastructure and governmental facilities;

     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      Provide alternative and innovative funding sources to governmental entities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      Allow governmental entities to leverage and supplement the developmental cost of public infrastructure and governmental facilities through private funding and participation by the private sector in governmental incentive and tax programs that are not otherwise available to governmental entities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      It is necessary to authorize the formation of public-private partnerships that may result in the ability to develop private projects for public infrastructure and government facilities in a more cost-efficient and timely manner, resulting in increased benefits to the public safety and welfare of the citizens of the state and substantial cost benefits to the governmental entities and the public.
