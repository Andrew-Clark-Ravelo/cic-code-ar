       Acts 1995, No. 613, § 6: Mar. 14, 1995. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eightieth General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the fiscal soundness of the various state-supported retirement systems is vital to the operation of Arkansas state government; that the proper fiscal management of public retirement systems promotes the goal of good government and provides public employees with an incentive to perform efficiently and effectively; and that any delay in implementing a policy of sound fiscal management with regard to state-supported retirement systems could result in a financial disaster for any marginally financed retirement system in Arkansas. Therefore, in order to prevent a potential financial catastrophe, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
      </h5>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 11, § 7: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the Teacher Retirement System law does not recognize certain payments made by schools to teaching personnel as salary payments as defined under the retirement law, that allowing a broader definition of salary will help members achieve higher salaries for credit in the retirement system, that by increasing the benefits to members, more educators will be encouraged to stay in the teaching career fields, and that the most effective time to make changes to the retirement system is at the beginning of the State's fiscal year and therefore this act should take effect immediately at that time. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 22, § 5: Feb. 4, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the Teacher Retirement System currently provides members with noncontributory retirement service credit; that some members need to have contributory service credit to provide for an adequate retirement; and that providing for a change to contributory credited service will improve the motivation and effectiveness of the active teachers in Arkansas public schools. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
      </h5>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 29, § 6: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that certain Teacher Retirement System retirants, for personal reasons which they do not wish disclosed, may want to suspend their benefits, that providing retirants with this option leaves the system open to question about liability for these suspended benefits and the law needs clarification in this situation, and that the most effective time to make changes to the retirement system is at the beginning of the state's fiscal year and therefore this act should take effect immediately at that time. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 30, § 6: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that certain Teacher Retirement System retirants are sometimes needed by the Arkansas Department of Education to fulfill vital positions within the educational system of Arkansas, that current retirement law limits the amount of salaries which can be paid to System retirees and the law needs to provide a method by which the System can waive those earning limitations, and that the most effective time to make changes to the retirement system is at the beginning of the State's fiscal year and therefore this act should take effect immediately at that time. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 81, § 7: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the Teacher Retirement System provides members with the option to choose either a contributory or noncontributory membership, that keeping track of these options consumes a considerable amount of administrative time and effort, that the law needs to be simplified to reduce the cost and effort of keeping track of these options, and that the most effective time to make changes to the retirement system is at the beginning of the State's fiscal year and therefore this act should take effect immediately at that time. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 110, § 7: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the Teacher Retirement System law recognizes private school and out-of-state service for the purchase of credited service; that allowing the purchase of smaller increments of credited service will help members achieve more service credit for their teaching careers, that by increasing the benefit to members, more educators will be encouraged to stay in the teaching career fields; and that the most effective time to make changes to the retirement system is at the beginning of the state's fiscal year and therefore this act should take effect immediately at that time. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 221, § 6: Feb. 23, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that members of the Teacher Retirement System who receive the minimum benefits are some of the poorest retirees and are in the most need of having their benefits increased, and that the minimum benefits need adjusting based on the number of years of service to increase the equity of the benefit structure of the retirement system, and therefore this act should have effect immediately with the beginning of the State's fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 311, § 6: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that, due to the ever escalating costs of health insurance and health care, benefits provided under the Arkansas State Highway Employees' Retirement System are inadequate and that an increase should be provided as soon as practicable in order to avoid an undue hardship. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 312, § 6: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that deceased members of the Teacher Retirement System leave families in need of financial support and that there is a necessity of financial stability for families during this time of crisis and the death benefit provisions should be increased, and that increasing the death benefit provisions of the retirement system can most effectively be managed at the beginning of the state's fiscal year and therefore this act should have effect immediately with the beginning of the state's fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly, that certain provisions of the law governing the Public Employees Retirement System need to be amended concerning eligibility, death benefits, and disability benefits, and that the effective administration of state government makes it necessary for these changes to begin at the start of the state's fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
<h5>

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that certain retirement annuity options continue for long periods of time, that providing these retirants with the capability of changing those options in the event of a death or divorce of the retirant or his beneficiaries will provide the needed flexibility in their financial conditions and that the most effective time to make changes to the retirement system is at the beginning of the state's fiscal year and therefore this act should take effect immediately at that time. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”
      </h5>
<h5>

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

<h5>
       Acts 1999, No. 496, § 9: July 1, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly, that retirement benefits payable to current and future retirants and beneficiaries of the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System are inadequate; that the current and future retirant and beneficiary payments should be increased as soon as possible in order to relieve this inequity, and that the effective fiscal administration of the System will be aided by implementing those increases at the same time as the state's fiscal year begins. Therefore, in order to promote sound fiscal administration in State government, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that the Teacher Retirement System law must be changed and refined periodically to clarify existing administrative practices within the system, that clarifying incorrect references and language in current law consumes a considerable amount of administrative time and effort, that the law needs to be clarified to reduce the cost and effort of responding to those inconsistencies, and that the most effective time to make changes to the retirement system is at the beginning of the State's fiscal year and therefore this act should take effect immediately at that time. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 1999.”

      The 2011 amendment added (b)(1)(B); and, in (b)(1)(A), deleted “or the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System” preceding “shall receive credit” and deleted “and the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System” preceding “together with interest”.

<p>
      The purpose of this section is to provide notice to an applicant for concurrent employment in a public employee position that the concurrent employment might affect the employee's retirement benefits and to allow the employee and employer an opportunity to consider an alternative method of employment that would allow an enhanced retirement benefit for the prospective employee.
     </p>
<p>
      If an applicant for concurrent employment in a public employee position provides information to a prospective public employer that the applicant is a current public employee and is enrolled as a member of a reciprocal system, then the prospective employer shall notify the applicant that it may be in the applicant's best interest to contact his or her current retirement system regarding the legal status of retirement benefits that may result if the applicant is employed by two (2) or more state-supported retirement systems.
     </p>
<p>
      The failure of a state-supported retirement system to notify a prospective employee under this section does not create a legal obligation on behalf of the state-supported retirement system or a legal right on behalf of the prospective employee.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the Eighty-third General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act makes technical corrections to a number of sections of Arkansas Code Title 24; that other legislation of this session of the General Assembly may also amend some of those sections; that this act should become effective immediately so that other legislation may be amended to reflect the technical corrections made by this act and to avoid conflicts. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

       Acts 2013, No. 304, § 2: Mar. 11, 2013. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the boards of trustees of the state retirement systems are bound to invest and manage trust assets under the Prudent Investor Rule, exercising reasonable care, skill, and caution when making investment and management decisions; that each contract to invest and manage system assets is intensely reviewed for favorable terms and executed to provide optimal return on the investment, keeping fees and other expenses to a minimum; that contracts that utilize the highly specialized and competitive skills of investment advisors in the public, private, and real estate markets require expertise that is particular to each state retirement system for which they invest, advise, or manage funds; that contracts are traditionally negotiated for terms that may last for decades for the benefit of the particular state retirement system so that the structure of the investment to receive profit may be fully realized and that this act is immediately necessary to prevent any state retirement system from being unduly burdened and severely financially harmed if it is forced to renegotiate these contracts, exposing the state retirement system to higher fees that total in the millions of dollars. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act, being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the Eighty-third General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act makes technical corrections to a number of sections of Arkansas Code Title 24; that other legislation of this session of the General Assembly may also amend some of those sections; that this act should become effective immediately so that other legislation may be amended to reflect the technical corrections made by this act and to avoid conflicts. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that economic conditions have caused the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System to suffer losses in the value of its financial assets; that the loss of asset value has created an unfunded actuarial accrued liability exceeding the standard thirty (30) year amortization period set by Arkansas law; that increasing the employer contribution rate will add to the asset values for the system and eventually return the system to financial balance; and that this act is immediately necessary because increases in the employer contribution rates can best be implemented over the summer between school years. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2003.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the Arkansas Supreme Court declared the public school funding system to be inadequate and that public schools are operating under a constitutional infirmity which must be corrected immediately; that to correct the constitutional infirmity and to ensure adequate funding for public education, the General Assembly must revise the public school funding formula, revise laws regarding public school facilities, provide funding for retirement increases and limit additional increases; and enact other necessary reform measures; and that this act is immediately necessary to ensure that reform measures are available to public schools for the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school years. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

        Shopping center owned by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System was not exempt from ad valorem taxation, under Ark. Const. Art. 16, § 5(b), despite this section and § 24-7-204, purportedly exempting the property, because (1) the statutes had to yield to the Arkansas Constitution, under which public property was only exempt if the property was used exclusively for a public purpose, and (2) it was undisputed that the property was leased to private businesses.

        There is no irreconcilable conflict that compels a disjunctive reading of the language in the introductory paragraph of § 24-4-302 that refers to three definitions in this section; read together, the definitions of “County employees” and “Employees” in this section harmoniously provide that “county employees” means all employees who are paid, either directly or indirectly, from funds appropriated by county participating public employers.

       Acts 1977 (1st Ex.

The section provided further that the repeal of the acts specifically referred to in Acts 1977, No. 754, § 2 would preclude persons who first served in a county elected constitutional office after July 1, 1977 from participating in or becoming eligible for the special county elected constitutional officer benefits prescribed in those acts and that it was not the intention of the General Assembly in repealing those acts to affect the rights of any person to retire and receive benefits thereunder if the person had retired and was receiving benefits thereunder on June 30, 1977, or had met the service requirements for retirement thereunder on June 30, 1977, or had any county elected constitutional officer credited service in the system on June 30, 1977, and if the person thereafter met the minimum service requirements for retiring and receiving benefits under the County Elected Constitutional Officer Division (now Subdivision). Rather, those persons were to continue to have the right to accumulate credited service and to receive benefits under those acts and the survivors of those persons had the right to receive benefits thereunder the same as if those acts had not been repealed.”

        All three definitions (“County employees”, “Employees”, and “Nonstate employees”) in § 24-4-101 had to be applied to determine the county nursing home employees'
   eligibility for membership in the Arkansas Public Employees'
   Retirement System.
   Bd. of Trs. of the Ark. Pub. Emples. Ret. Sys. v. Garrison, 2019 Ark. App. 245, 576 S.W.3d 485 (2019).
       </h5>
<h5>
        There is no irreconcilable conflict that compels a disjunctive reading of the language in the introductory paragraph of this section that refers to three definitions in § 24-4-101 with “and”; read together, the definitions of “County employees” and “Employees” in § 24-4-101 harmoniously provide that “county employees” means all employees who are paid, either directly or indirectly, from funds appropriated by county participating public employers.
   Bd. of Trs. of the Ark. Pub. Emples. Ret. Sys. v. Garrison, 2019 Ark. App. 245, 576 S.W.3d 485 (2019).

<h5>
        Substantial evidence supported the finding of the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Public Employees'
   Retirement System that former employees of nursing homes owned by counties were not “county employees” under the relevant statutes and were not eligible for membership in the retirement system because their compensation was payable from patient revenues rather than from appropriated funds.
   Bd. of Trs. of the Ark. Pub. Emples. Ret. Sys. v. Garrison, 2019 Ark. App. 245, 576 S.W.3d 485 (2019).
       </h5>
<h5>
        Assuming that the nursing-home administrative boards and their respective counties were synonymous under the definitions of “County employees” and “Employees” in § 24-4-101, the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Public Employees'
   Retirement System's finding that the former employees of county-owned nursing homes were not paid from appropriated funds as required by the definition of “Employees” in § 24-4-101 was affirmed as no ordinances in the record specifically designated county money for their compensation.

      (A)(i)A person who receives or who is receiving a benefit solely because of disability but who meets or has met the elected credited service and total credited service requirement but not the age requirement for a benefit provided for a member with elected service, upon attaining the required age, may have his or her disability retirement status changed to superannuation.
     </p>
<p>
      If a retirant refuses to submit to a medical examination in any period, his or her disability annuity may be suspended by the board until his or her withdrawal of the refusal.
     </p>
<p>
      If the refusal continues for one (1) year, all of the retirant's rights in and to a disability annuity may be revoked by the board.
     </p>
<p>
      If, upon the medical examination of the retirant, the physician reports to the board that the retirant is physically and mentally able and capable for a suitable job or position as an employee, his or her disability retirement shall terminate.

   If a disability retirant secures employment with an employer not considered a public employer, as defined in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-101" target="_self">24-4-101</a></cite>, for the purpose of determining whether he or she is capable of returning to employment, then the disability retirant shall be allowed to earn compensation from the employment for a period of time not to exceed nine (9) months, during which period of time the retirant shall receive no monthly benefits from the system.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)If at the end of the nine-month trial work period the retirant wishes to continue his or her employment outside the system, then the retirant's disability retirement status shall terminate. For the purpose of determining his or her eligibility for any other benefit, the retirant shall be considered to have terminated active membership as of the time of disability retirement but for a reason other than disability or death.

   If the former disability retirant again becomes an employee of a public employer, as defined in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-101" target="_self">24-4-101</a></cite>, the retirant shall immediately again become a member of the system, his or her credited service at the time of his or her disability retirement shall be restored to the retirant's credit, and the amount of his or her accumulated contributions at the time of his or her disability retirement shall be restored to his or her credit in the members' deposit account.

      In no event shall the retirant be given service credit for the period he or she was in receipt of the disability annuity.

      Should the former disability retirant again become totally and permanently disabled within twenty-four (24) months immediately following his or her return to membership or should the retirant qualify for benefits by reason of age and service, the eighteen (18) months' credited service requirement specified in this section shall be waived.

      In case of doubt as to what would be substantially gainful, the board shall have the final power to decide the question.

        Employee was properly found ineligible to receive retirement benefits from the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System (APERS) because, (1) when the employee instructed the county clerk to remove the employee from the county payroll and began paying for the employee's health insurance, the employee did not terminate the employee's employment, as required, since the employee continued to perform the employee's job functions, and (2) the employee did not submit a letter of resignation to APERS or to the county quorum court.

        When an employee was properly found ineligible to receive retirement benefits from the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System, the employee was also not eligible to continue to receive service credits because the employee did not avail herself of the only process for revoking the employee's retirement, under 075-00-001 Ark. Code R. § 207 (Weil 2001), so the employee's election of retirement was irrevocable, and the employee's retirement benefits were forfeited pending meeting the requirement of this section to terminate the employee's employment, as the employee's failure to terminate employment did not mean the employee was not retired.

        24-4-522. Applicability of benefit provisions.

</h3>
<p>
       The benefit provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to specified members of the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System.
      </p>
<p>
       (1)The noncontributory benefit provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to each person who has never been a member of the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System before January 1, 1978, and who is employed on or after January 1, 1978, in a position covered by the system and who thereby becomes a member.
      </p>
<p>
       In addition, each other member who was actively employed in a position covered by the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System on June 30, 1991, may elect to become covered by the noncontributory benefit provisions of this chapter by application written to, and received by, the governing body of the plan before January 1, 1985.
      </p>
<p>
       (A)(i)Each other member who was not actively employed in a position covered by the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System on January 1, 1978, shall become covered by the noncontributory benefit provisions of this chapter at the time the member first becomes so employed after January 1, 1978, unless he or she elects to become covered by the provisions of the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System which require member contributions, by election written to, and received by, the governing body of the system before the later of January 1, 1986, and six (6) months after the member first becomes so employed after January 1, 1978.
      </p>
<p>
       However, if the member so elects benefits requiring member contributions, he or she shall pay the member contributions from the date of the employment, together with regular interest, from the dates the contributions would normally have been received by the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System to the dates of actual payment.
      </p>
<p>
       (i)The benefits of each member's becoming covered by the noncontributory benefit provisions of this chapter shall be computed by applying the benefit provisions prescribed by this chapter for all credited service of the person rendered before and after January 1, 1978.
      </p>
<p>
       However, benefit amounts based upon employment before January 1, 1978, shall not be less than benefit amounts computed in accordance with the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System benefit provisions at the time of retirement which require member contributions.
      </p>
<p>
       (1)The noncontributory benefit provisions of this chapter, including death and disability benefits, shall apply to all credited service rendered before or after the date of election of employees of the Department of Human Services in either the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System or the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System.
      </p>
<p>
       (A)Employees of the Department of Human Services and employees of Arkansas Rehabilitation Services shall be entitled to the benefit amount computed by applying the benefit provisions prescribed by this chapter for all credited service rendered before and after January 1, 1978, except that benefit amounts based upon employment before January 1, 1978, shall not be less than benefit amounts computed in accordance with benefit provisions in effect December 31, 1977.
      </p>
<p>
       On and after January 1, 1993, employees of Arkansas Rehabilitation Services who elected to be covered by the provisions of this subsection and who are still active employees on January 1, 1993, shall be entitled to the benefit amount computed by applying the benefit provisions prescribed by this chapter for all credited service rendered before and after January 1, 1978, except that benefit amounts based upon employment before January 1, 1978, shall be computed in accordance with current benefit provisions in effect for the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System at the time of their retirement.
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   In computing the benefit under the benefit provisions of this chapter, the final average compensation shall be computed upon all service before and after the election of the Arkansas Rehabilitation Services employee as provided in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-101ol133" target="_self">24-4-101(33)</a></cite> and §24-4-746.
      </p>
<p>
       Each public retirement system in which the employee has served shall be responsible financially for the benefit amounts payable to the retirant, the retirant's survivors, and the retirant's beneficiaries based upon the ratio of the number of years the employee was a member of that public retirement system to the total number of years the employee was a member of any of the two (2) statewide retirement systems, i.e., the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System or the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System.
      </p>
<p>
       (1)(A)The benefit provisions of this chapter shall be administered by the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System for the benefit of all employees making the option.
      </p>
<p>
       The Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System shall certify monthly the amount of benefits paid hereunder, and the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System shall immediately transfer that amount from its benefit account to the proper account designated by the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System.
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   If an employee of the Department of Human Services who becomes or has become a member of the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System under the provisions of this section leaves employment with the Department of Human Services and becomes employed in another position covered by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, the person's credited service, both before and after his or her service under this chapter, shall be subject to the benefit provisions of §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-701" target="_self">24-7-701</a></cite>,<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-702" target="_self">24-7-702</a></cite>,<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-704" target="_self">24-7-704</a></cite> —<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-713" target="_self">24-7-713</a></cite>,<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-715" target="_self">24-7-715</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-716" target="_self">24-7-716</a></cite> [repealed].

      </p>
<p>
       Members of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System who have not elected to pay contributions to that system on full salary shall not be eligible to elect to become covered by the benefit provisions of this chapter unless they first make written application with the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System for full salary coverage for all salaries received from July 1, 1969, until the date of making the election to come under the provisions of this chapter and paying to the system the amount of the additional contributions, plus regular interest, for full salary credited service.

   (1)Beginning July 1, 2001, any member who retires as provided in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-508" target="_self">24-4-508</a></cite> or §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-510" target="_self">24-4-510</a></cite> —<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-512" target="_self">24-4-512</a></cite> shall receive a straight life annuity for each year of contributory service credit equal to two and seven-hundredths percent (2.07%) of the member's final average compensation multiplied by the number of years and fraction of a year of credited service rendered on or after July 1, 2001, with the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   Beginning July 1, 2001, any member who retires as provided in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-508" target="_self">24-4-508</a></cite> or §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-510" target="_self">24-4-510</a></cite> —<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-512" target="_self">24-4-512</a></cite> shall receive a straight life annuity for each year of contributory service credit equal to two and eleven-hundredths percent (2.11%) of the member's average compensation multiplied by the number of years and fraction of a year of credited service rendered before July 1, 2001, with the system.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)For each year of noncontributory credited service in the system rendered prior to July 1, 2007, resulting from employment in a position covered at any time by Social Security or another federal retirement plan supported wholly or in part by employer contributions, a member shall receive one and seventy-five-hundredths percent (1.75%) of the member's final average compensation plus, for each year of noncontributory credited service in the system rendered prior to July 1, 2007, resulting from employment in a position never so covered, a member shall receive two and eleven-hundredths percent (2.11%) of the member's final average compensation.
     </p>
<p>
      For each year of credited service in the system rendered after June 30, 2007, resulting from employment in a position covered at any time by Social Security or another federal retirement plan supported wholly or in part by employer contributions, a member shall receive one and seventy-two-hundredths percent (1.72%) of the member's final average compensation plus, for each year of credited service in the system rendered after June 30, 2007, resulting from employment in a position never so covered, a member shall receive two and seven-hundredths percent (2.07%) of the member's final average compensation. In no event shall service as a district judge in the state division receive less than three percent (3%) of the member's final average compensation.
     </p>
<p>
      For each year of actual service in the system in excess of twenty-eight (28) years that is rendered on or after July 1, 2009, a member shall receive a straight life annuity equal to an additional five-tenths of one percent (0.5%) of the member's final average compensation.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)A member of the General Assembly first elected before July 1, 1999, shall receive a monthly annuity equal to thirty-five dollars ($35.00) multiplied by the number of years of actual service as a member of the General Assembly.
     </p>
<p>
      A member of the General Assembly first elected before July 1, 1999, who served as Speaker of the House of Representatives or President Pro Tempore of the Senate shall receive a monthly annuity equal to forty dollars ($40.00) multiplied by the total number of years of actual service as a member of the General Assembly.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (1)In addition, if a member has credited service resulting from employment in a position covered at any time by Social Security or another federal retirement plan supported wholly or in part by employer contributions, and if that member is retiring as provided in subsection (b) of this section or §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c04s24-4-510" target="_self">24-4-510</a></cite>, and if that member's age at retirement is younger than Social Security's minimum age for an immediate retirement benefit and age sixty-two (62), then that member of the system shall receive a temporary annuity equal to thirty-three-hundredths of one percent (0.33%) of his or her final average compensation for each year of the noncontributory credited service.
     </p>
<p>
      The temporary annuity shall terminate at the end of the calendar month in which the earliest of the following events occurs:
     </p>
<p>
      The member's death;
     </p>
<p>
      The member's attainment of the Social Security minimum age; or
     </p>
<p>
      The member's attainment of age sixty-two (62).
     </p>
<p>
      It is considered sound public policy that retirement pay not exceed working pay except for increases after retirement caused by inflation. Accordingly, at the time of retirement the total of the system's noncontributory annuities resulting from employment in a position also covered by Social Security shall not exceed the member's final average compensation.
     </p>
<p>
      If no temporary annuity is payable as provided in this subsection or after the temporary annuity has terminated and if the member has at retirement any credited service for any period of time prior to July 1, 1991, then the future payments of the annuity for life shall not be less than they would have been under the provisions that were in effect on July 1, 1990, for this subsection, plus a corresponding increase for any benefit enhancements that have been enacted since July 1, 1991.

<p>
       A member may retire voluntarily as follows:
      </p>
<p>
       At age sixty-five (65), or during any year thereafter until the age of compulsory retirement has been attained, with a minimum of five (5) years of creditable service in the Arkansas State Highway Employees' Retirement System;
      </p>
<p>
       At age sixty-two (62), with a minimum of fifteen (15) years of creditable service in the system;
      </p>
<p>
       At age sixty (60), with a minimum of twenty (20) years of creditable service in the system; or
      </p>
<p>
       Regardless of age, with thirty (30) years of creditable service in the system.
      </p>
<p>
       (1)Any retired member who has creditable service with the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department or the Arkansas Department of Transportation for more than thirty-five (35) years and who is not receiving benefits based on his or her actual creditable service time, on February 27, 1991, shall have his or her annuity adjusted at that time.
      </p>
<p>
       The adjustment shall be equivalent to the retirant's original annuity, adjusted for actual service time and subsequent cost-of-living and any ad hoc increases.
      </p>
<p>
       The retirant shall be paid such adjusted annuity for each month thereafter.
      </p>
<p>
       The Board of Trustees of the Arkansas State Highway Employees' Retirement System, by rule, may reduce the amount of creditable service required to retire voluntarily regardless of age from thirty (30) years of creditable service to an amount of no less than twenty-eight (28) years of creditable service, if the board determines that the change is fair and just to the members of the system and that it is actuarially appropriate.

        24-5-113. Eligibility for benefits — Disability retirement — Definition.
       </b>
</h3>
<p>
       A member shall be eligible for disability retirement benefits after five (5) or more years of creditable service in the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department or the Arkansas Department of Transportation, but no member shall be eligible to receive benefits for a disability incurred prior to his or her becoming a member of the Arkansas State Highway Employees' Retirement System.
      </p>
<p>
       No member may be retired on account of disability until conclusive evidence, based on a proper medical examination, has been submitted to the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas State Highway Employees' Retirement System that the member is disabled to the extent that he or she can no longer perform his or her assigned duties.
      </p>
<p>
       A member who is retired because of disability shall be required to undergo periodic medical examinations at the discretion of the board.
      </p>
<p>
       If and when a medical examination shows that the disability has been removed, disability retirement benefits shall cease.
      </p>
<p>
       A disability allowance shall not be granted unless there is conclusive evidence that the disability will be permanent or of long duration.
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (1)If a disability retirant secures employment with an employer not considered a state employer, as defined by §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c02s24-2-401" target="_self">24-2-401</a></cite>, for the purpose of determining whether he or she is capable of returning to employment, then the disability retirant shall be allowed to earn compensation from the employment for a period of time not to exceed nine (9) months, during which period of time the retirant shall receive no monthly benefits from the system.
      </p>
<p>
       If the retirant becomes unable to continue his or her employment before the nine-month period expires, then his or her disability retirement benefits from the system shall be reinstated and be effective the first day of the month after terminating employment.
      </p>
<p>
       Only one (1) trial work period is allowed any disability retirant, but the nine (9) months need not be consecutive.
      </p>
<p>
       The trial work period does not prevent the consideration of any medical evidence which may demonstrate recovery before the ninth month of trial work.
      </p>
<p>
       (A)If, at the end of the nine-month trial work period, the retirant wishes to continue his or her employment outside the system, then the disability retirement status shall terminate.

<div>
<h5>
<b>
        “(2)
       </b>

The subdivision may again become effective upon cessation of coverage under that program. See § 21-2-703.

       Subsection (a) of this section was amended by Acts 1989, Nos. 23 and 529. Acts 1989, No. 529 has been codified as it was deemed to include the amendments made by Acts 1989, No. 23.

      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
       “(a) It is found and determined by the General Assembly that the Department of Arkansas State Police has had ongoing financial difficulty for over twelve (12) years. The State Police Retirement System has sustained investment losses of approximately one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) within the last two (2) years, and so needs a larger investment pool to help reduce risk and enhance returns. The Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System has the size and expertise to effectively reduce the volatility of returns, enhance relative returns, and best protect the State Police Retirement System.
      </h5>
<h5>
       “(b) This act represents a negotiated alternative to a proposal that would have eliminated the State Police Retirement System and would have made it a division of the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System.
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
       “(c) This act maintains the autonomy over State Police Retirement System benefits but ensures funds are invested in a larger, more diversified pool of assets.
      </h5>
<h5>
       “(d) It is contemplated that at such time as the State Police Retirement System attains a funding level in which assets are eighty percent (80%) or more of actuarially accrued liabilities, the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System may consider certain enhancements to the Tier II Deferred Retirement Option Plan.”

        Police officers brought a suit against state, asking for a writ of mandamus and declaratory judgment with respect to the funding of the Arkansas State Police Retirement System. The class action suit was not barred by sovereign immunity because this section specifically provided for a waiver of immunity when an error was made in payment calculations.

        This section did not waive immunity where the officers were not alleging an error in calculating their benefits, but were challenging the statutorily amended interest rate and the trustee's vote to reduce the interest rate pursuant to that statute, § 24-6-304; further, the Legislature added § 24-6-103 in 2011, which affirms sovereign immunity.

   (1)At the request of the Executive Secretary of the State Police Retirement System, the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration shall make annual transfers on each June 30 to the system from the remainder of insurance premium taxes enumerated in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.19.html#t19c06s19-6-301ol127" target="_blank">19-6-301(27)</a></cite> before those taxes are transferred to general revenues enumerated in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.19.html#t19c06s19-6-201ol119" target="_blank">19-6-201(19)</a></cite> the amounts of money necessary to amortize the unfunded liabilities over a period not to exceed thirty (30) years.
     </p>
<p>
      These transfers are intended to cover the unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities of the system and shall not be used for the purpose of providing any benefit enhancements for the system.
     </p>
<p>
      Members of the system shall not be entitled to any benefit enhancements from these transfers unless funds from sources other than insurance premium taxes are found to provide for the retirement benefit enhancements.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The amount of the transfer shall be determined by computing the dollar amount required based on the actuarially determined employer rate in the most recent annual actuarial valuation and subtracting from that amount the statutory contribution amount specified in subsection (a) of this section and the driver's license reinstatement fees provided by §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.27.html#t27c16s27-16-808" target="_blank">27-16-808</a></cite>.

<p>
      These transfers shall be limited in use solely for the purpose of paying the unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities.

<p>
      If the transfers under this section exceed eight hundred thousand dollars ($800,000) per fiscal year, the executive secretary shall notify the Joint Interim Committee on Public Retirement and Social Security Programs, which shall then review the use of the funds and the benefit provisions of the system and the actuarial reports on the system to ensure compliance with the intended purpose of the funds.

<p>
</p><p>
   (1)In the event any uniformed employee of the Division of Arkansas State Police is killed while in the performance of his or her duties, yet the surviving spouse and surviving children of the uniformed employee of the division are deprived of receiving benefits as prescribed in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c06s24-6-217" target="_self">24-6-217</a></cite> because the uniformed employee was not a member of the system at the time of his or her death, or had not completed any probationary period of service required by rules of the Arkansas State Police Commission, or had not obtained sufficient service for benefits, the surviving spouse may make application to the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System.
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   Upon establishing proof of the facts set forth in this subsection, the surviving spouse and surviving children shall be eligible for and receive survivors' benefits for himself or herself and the unmarried children of the deceased uniformed employee who was killed in the line of duty, which children are under eighteen (18) years of age or twenty-two (22) years of age while enrolled in an institution of higher education, as provided in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c06s24-6-217" target="_self">24-6-217</a></cite>.
       </p>
<p>
        Upon the reaching of eighteen (18) years of age by the unmarried children or the failure to enroll in an institution of higher education if the child is under age twenty-two (22), the surviving spouse shall continue to receive benefits as provided by law, but upon his or her remarriage or death, the benefits shall terminate.
       </p>
<p>
        It is the specific intent of this section that surviving spouses as described in this section be eligible for survivors' benefits for themselves and any unmarried children under eighteen (18) years of age of the deceased uniformed employee of the division who was killed in the line of duty, or any children under age twenty-two (22) while enrolled in an institution of higher education, irrespective of whether the employee was a member of, or was eligible for benefits under, the State Police Retirement System at the time of his or her death.
       </p>
<p>
        Upon certification of these facts by the board, the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration shall direct the Treasurer of State to transfer from the Division of Arkansas State Police Fund, annually, to the State Police Retirement Fund an amount equal to the funds expended from the State Police Retirement Fund for the payment of survivors' benefits as authorized in this section in order to reimburse the State Police Retirement Fund therefor.
       </p>
<p>
        (1)For purposes of this section, “an institution of higher education” means any public university, college, community college, and any nonpublicly supported not-for-profit college or university.
       </p>
<p>
        The board is hereby authorized to establish through rules a means of verification of enrollment in an institution of higher education by a surviving child under this section for purposes of continuation of pension benefits.

<p>
      (1)(A)Upon application filed with the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System by a member or by the Director of the Division of Arkansas State Police on behalf of a member, a member who is in the employ of the Division of Arkansas State Police, who has five (5) or more years of actual service, and who becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for duty in the employ of the division by reason of personal injury or disease may be retired by the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System, but only after a medical examination of the member.

<p>
      This examination shall be made by or under the direction of a board of medical professionals as defined in the rules of the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System, using the active duty criteria supplied by the division in determining the extent of the disability.
     </p>
<p>
      The five-years-of-service requirement contained in this subsection shall not apply to a member whom the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System finds to be in receipt of workers' compensation for his or her disability arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of his or her employment with the division.

</p><p>
   Upon his or her retirement upon account of disability as provided in subsection (a) of this section, a member shall receive a disability pension computed according to the contributory provisions of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c06s24-6-214" target="_self">24-6-214</a></cite> or the noncontributory provisions of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c06s24-6-227" target="_self">24-6-227</a></cite>, as applicable.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)At least one (1) time each year during the first five (5) years following a member's retirement on account of disability and at least one (1) time in every three-year period thereafter, the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System may, and upon the retirant's application shall, require any disability retirant who has not attained age fifty (50) to undergo a medical examination to be made by or under the direction of the medical professionals designated by the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System.
     </p>
<p>
      If the retirant refuses to submit to a medical examination in any such period, his or her disability pension may be suspended by the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System until his or her withdrawal of his or her refusal.
     </p>
<p>
      If his or her refusal continues for one (1) year, all his or her rights in and to a disability pension may be revoked by the Board of Trustees of the State Police Retirement System.

       Amendments.
      </b>
      The 2019 amendment substituted “Division of Arkansas State Police” for “Department of Arkansas State Police” twice in (a)(1)(A); and substituted “division” for “department” throughout the section.
     </h3>
<p>
      (1)Upon retirement as provided in this subchapter, a member shall receive a straight life pension equal to two and four hundred seventy-five thousandths percent (2.475%) of the member's final average compensation multiplied by the number of years and any fraction of a year of his or her service.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)In addition, if a member has service resulting from employment in a position covered at any time by Social Security or another federal retirement plan supported wholly or in part by employer contributions, and if that member's age at retirement is younger than:
     </p>
<p>
      Social Security's minimum age for an immediate retirement benefit; and
     </p>
<p>
      Age sixty-two (62),
     </p>
<p>
      The temporary annuity shall terminate at the end of the calendar month in which the earliest of the following events occurs:
     </p>
<p>
      The member's death;
     </p>
<p>
      The member's attainment of the Social Security minimum age; or
     </p>
<p>
      The member's attainment of age sixty-two (62).
     </p>
<p>
      In the event a member with five (5) years or more of actual service in the State Police Retirement System ceases to be employed as a state police officer prior to reaching fifty-five (55) years of age and does not withdraw his or her accumulated employee contributions to the system, the member shall be entitled to receive a pension upon reaching what the member's voluntary retirement age would have been if he or she had continued state police employment from the time of termination of employment.
     </p>
<p>
      Any member may elect to withdraw his or her accumulated contributions to the system at the time of terminating employment as a state police officer and to waive any pension rights the member may have earned in the system.
     </p>
<p>
      It is considered sound public policy that retirement pay not exceed working pay except for increases after retirement caused by inflation. Accordingly, at the time of retirement, the total of named-plan annuities shall not exceed the member's final average compensation.
     </p>
<p>
      No provision of this section shall be applicable to service that is credited at a rate other than one (1) month for each month of employment.

<p>
      The purpose of this section is to create incentives for the efficient management of the public higher education resources of the State of Arkansas by allowing public higher education institutions to establish early retirement window incentives for qualified nontenured faculty and staff who elect voluntary separation from the institution.
     </p>
<p>
      The boards of trustees of the publicly supported institutions of higher education may provide special allowances for nontenured faculty and staff to effect a saving in personnel salaries and fringe benefits costs when it is determined by the boards that such saving will provide for more efficient operation of the institutions.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)The boards of trustees shall approve criteria to determine qualifications to be met by the institutions and the employee.
     </p>
<p>
      Such qualifications shall include, but are not limited to:
     </p>
<p>
      Assurance that participation is strictly voluntary for employees;
     </p>
<p>
      Only full-time employees who are at least fifty-five (55) years of age or meet the retirement requirements for the Civil Service Retirement System; and
     </p>
<p>
      A savings in personnel cost will be realized by the institution.
     </p>
<p>
      The amount of all such allowances for any institution shall not exceed, in the aggregate during any fiscal year, an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate paid for personnel costs during the preceding fiscal year for the institution.

        Substantial evidence supported the finding that a school district was responsible for paying the employer contribution to the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (ATRS) on settlement proceeds a teacher received and that a school district failed to follow the calculation of damages designated in the settlement as back pay because a 14% employer contribution had to be paid on all salary, and ATRS could treat as salary any remuneration paid to a member for settlement with an employer.

        Shopping center owned by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System was not exempt from ad valorem taxation, under Ark. Const. Art. 16, § 5(b), despite § 24-2-703 and this section, purportedly exempting the property, because (1) the statutes had to yield to the Arkansas Constitution, under which public property was only exempt if the property was used exclusively for a public purpose, and (2) it was undisputed that the property was leased to private businesses.

        24-7-401. Fund contributions — Fund rates.
       </b>
</h3>
<p>
       (1)The financial objective of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System is to establish and receive contributions that expressed as percentages of active member payroll will remain approximately level from generation to generation of Arkansas citizens.
      </p>
<p>
       Contributions received each year shall be sufficient:
      </p>
<p>
       To fully cover the costs of benefit commitments being made to members for their service being rendered in that year; and
      </p>
<p>
       To make a level payment that if paid annually over a reasonable period of future years will fully cover the unfunded costs of benefit commitments for service previously rendered.
      </p>
<p>
       If the costs of benefit commitments for service previously rendered are overfunded, the plan may deduct a level payment that if deducted annually over a reasonable period of future years will fully liquidate the overfunded portion of the costs.
      </p>
<p>
       An actuarial valuation of the entire system shall be made at least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System's actuary.
      </p>
<p>
       (1)For each fiscal year, the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System shall establish employer contribution rates for the system prospectively and for each fiscal year thereafter.
      </p>
<p>
       The employer contribution rates shall be based on the actuary's determination of the rate required to fund the plan in accordance with the objectives stated in subsection (a) of this section.
      </p>
<p>
       The employer contribution rates shall be the rates determined by the board based on the annual actuarial valuation.
      </p>
<p>
       For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2008, through June 30, 2013, the employer contribution rate shall not exceed fourteen percent (14%).
      </p>
<p>
       (A)(i)Beginning July 1, 2015, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the employer contribution rate shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%).
      </p>
<p>
       Until July 1, 2015, the employer contribution rate shall not exceed fourteen percent (14%).
      </p>
<p>
       (i)For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and each fiscal year thereafter, the board may modify the employer contribution rate for future fiscal years above fourteen percent (14%) in increments of one-fourth of one percent (0.25%) per fiscal year provided that the system has a greater than eighteen-year amortization period to pay unfunded liabilities without an employer contribution rate of more than fourteen percent (14%) limited to a maximum employer contribution rate of fifteen percent (15%).
      </p>
<p>
       If a report provided by the system's actuary shows that the system's amortization period to pay unfunded liabilities is eighteen (18) years or less with a fourteen-percent employer contribution rate, then the employer contribution rate shall not exceed fourteen percent (14%).
      </p>
<p>
       (a)An increase in the employer contribution rate shall only occur if the system implements cost savings from member benefit programs or increased member contributions, or both, measured after July 1, 2013, that equal or exceed the value of the employer contribution increase before or at the same time as an employer contribution increase.
      </p>
<p>
       The cost savings from member benefit programs or increased member contributions, or both, shall take place or be approved before or at the same time as an employer contribution increase.
      </p>
<p>
       The system may rely upon actuarial reports by the system's actuary to determine the relative impact of changes to member benefit programs or increased member contributions, or both, including whether the cost savings from member benefit programs or increased member contributions, or both, are equal to or exceed the value of the proposed employer contribution increase.
      </p>
<p>
       The value of cost savings from a member benefit program or member contribution increases shall be set at the time of the initial actuarial report that establishes the estimated value and shall remain as initially set unless the member benefit program or member contribution rate has changes after the actuarial report sets value.
      </p>
<p>
       The employer contribution rate shall be such that the amortization period for all unfunded liability shall not exceed thirty (30) years. However, under no circumstance shall the required employer contribution rate exceed the maximum percentage rate under subsection (c) of this section.
      </p>
<p>
       (1)The board shall annually notify the participating employers of the employer contribution rate established by the board for the upcoming fiscal year.
      </p>
<p>
       Local school districts shall pay the teacher retirement employment contribution for any eligible employee in accordance with rules established by the board.
      </p>
<p>
       The Department of Education shall pay from the Public School Fund the teacher retirement employer contributions for eligible employees of participating employers as required by the department's appropriations act and in accordance with rules established by the board.
      </p>
<p>
       The annual employer contributions to be paid in each year for all other employees by each participating employer shall be the current state contribution percent multiplied by the total covered salaries of the employer's members in the fiscal year.
      </p>
<p>
       The employers' contributions shall be remitted to the system in such manner and form and in such frequency and shall be accompanied by such supporting data as the board shall prescribe from time to time.
      </p>
<p>
       Timely payment of the contributions shall be a condition of continuance of participation in the system.
      </p>
<p>
       (A)All employers shall pay the total employer contribution rate except as provided under subdivision (7)(B) of this section.
      </p>
<p>
       A public school employer shall pay the employer contribution rate up to fourteen percent (14%), and any additional employer contribution up to fifteen percent (15%) required by a public school employer shall be paid from additional funds appropriated by the State of Arkansas for the purpose of paying Arkansas Teacher Retirement System employer contributions.
      </p>
<p>
       An increase or decrease in an employer contribution rate shall:
      </p>
<p>
       Apply to a complete fiscal year; and
      </p>
<p>
       Remain in effect until modified by the board.
      </p>
<p>
       The board may adopt a change in the employer contribution rate by resolution at any board meeting.

       After July 1, 1999, all new members shall make the member contributions otherwise provided for in this section.

        “(ii)
       </b>
       Right of a member to elect a contributory or noncontributory status in the retirement system;

      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
<b>
        “(S)
       </b>
       Effective July 1, 2007, Acts 2007, No. 93 provided a member with an option to elect to be a contributory member depending on whether the member was:
      </h5>
<h5>
<b>
        “(i)
       </b>
       An active, non-contributory member of the retirement system;
      </h5>
</div>

<h5>
<b>
        “(ii)
       </b>

<h5>
<b>
        “(iii)

</div>
<div>
<h5>
<b>
        “(6)
       </b>
       The right of a member to elect a contributory or noncontributory status in the retirement system has not been amended since the passage of Acts 2007, No. 93;
      </h5>
<h5>
<b>
        “(7)
       </b>
       Myriad legislative amendments have continuously changed the ability of a member of the retirement system to become a revocable or irrevocable contributory or noncontributory member of the retirement system;
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
<b>
        “(8)
       </b>
       The classification of a member as an active, an inactive, or a new member of the retirement system affects the right of a member to elect a contributory or noncontributory status in the retirement system;
      </h5>
<h5>
<b>
        “(9)
       </b>
       The incorporation of the various legislative amendments into the Arkansas Code has created challenging subsections and subdivisions of the law through which the retirement system must determine the status of a member based on when the member first:
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
<b>
        “(A)
       </b>
       Enrolled in the retirement system;
      </h5>
<h5>
<b>
        “(B)
       </b>
       Returned to the retirement system; or
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
<b>
        “(C)
       </b>
       Elected a different status in the retirement system;
      </h5>
<h5>
<b>
        “(10)
       </b>
       The election of a contributory or noncontributory status in the retirement system affects the retirement benefit calculation for a member;
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
<b>
        “(11)
       </b>
       A restructuring of § 24-7-406(e) concerning the contributory or noncontributory status of a member of the retirement system is intended to retain existing law without impairing, broadening, or changing the applicability of § 24-7-406(e) to the current status of a member;
      </h5>
<h5>
<b>
        “(12)
       </b>
       The purpose of the amendment to § 24-7-406(e) is to simplify the current language and application of the statute to the current contributory or noncontributory status of a member of the retirement system, so that the retirement system may correctly and efficiently manage records pertaining to a member; and
      </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
<b>
        “(13)
       </b>
       Therefore, a restructuring of § 24-7-406(e) is necessary to:
      </h5>
<h5>
<b>
        “(A)
       </b>
       Accurately and logically organize the language of the statute in order to prevent ambiguity of the law and allow the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System to administer vested benefits and manage the accounts of its members;

        “(B)

<div>
<h5>

      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      (1)If any participating employer fails to remit to the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System contributions that are required by law, rule, or regulation by the fifteenth day of the month in which the moneys are due, then the system shall impose an interest penalty of eight percent (8%) per annum with a daily interest accrual.
     </p>
<p>
      For purposes of this subsection, an employer's remittance is not delinquent if the employer's remittance is:
     </p>
<p>
      Received by the system by the fifteenth day of the month in which the payment is due; or
     </p>
<p>
      Postmarked by the fourteenth day of the month in which the payment is due.
     </p>
<p>
      The interest penalty shall be determined by the system on the date the delinquent funds are received, and a statement of the interest penalty shall be sent to the participating public employer.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   If the interest penalty or delinquent moneys are not received by the system by the last business day of the month in which the moneys were originally due, then the system shall cause the sums of moneys, including the interest penalty, to be transferred from any moneys due the participating employer from the Treasurer of State and the Department of Education as provided in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.19.html#t19c05s19-5-106ol1a5" target="_blank">19-5-106(a)(5)</a></cite>.
     </p>
<p>
      This interest penalty shall be computed on the actual days of delinquency and shall be paid to the system to reimburse the trust fund for the money that would have been earned on the moneys had they been paid when due.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)If a participating employer fails to file with the system a report required by the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System by the fifteenth day of the month in which the report is due, then the system shall impose a penalty of one hundred fifty dollars ($150) for each late report.
     </p>
<p>
      For purposes of this subsection, a report is not late if the report is:
     </p>
<p>
      Received by the system by the fifteenth day of the month in which the report is due; or
     </p>
<p>
      Postmarked by the fourteenth day of the month in which the report is due.
     </p>
<p>
      A statement of the penalty shall be sent to the participating employer.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   If the penalty is not received by the last business day of the month in which the report was due, then the system shall cause the penalty amount to be transferred from any moneys due the participating employer from the Treasurer of State and the Department of Education as provided in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.19.html#t19c05s19-5-106ol1a5" target="_blank">19-5-106(a)(5)</a></cite>.
     </p>
<p>
      The penalty amounts collected shall be deposited to the credit of the administrative funds of the system to help defray the cost of additional expenses incurred due to the additional work required to process late reports.
     </p>
<p>
      In addition to the late report penalty under subdivision (b)(1) of this section, the system may impose an additional penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) for a report that is filed with the system over one (1) month late.
     </p>

      The board or its designee may waive penalties and interest for an employer delinquency under this section if the board or its designee finds that:

        24-7-611. Domestic federal service — Definition.

</h3>
<p>
       As used in this section, “domestic federal service” means service rendered as a teacher or administrator in any school or similar institution located on a military base or installation that is administered by the United States Department of Defense.
      </p>
<p>
       From and after January 1, 2003, an active member shall be eligible upon application to purchase domestic federal service to be credited as service under this section under the following conditions:
      </p>
<p>
       The domestic federal service credit to be granted shall be limited to service for which no benefit could be paid by a retirement system similar in purpose to the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System except Social Security if the member left on deposit his or her contributions to the other system, and it shall be limited to ten (10) years;
      </p>
<p>
       (A)For each year of domestic federal service credit granted, the member shall pay to the system the employee and employer contributions based on the actuarial equivalent of the member's benefits.
      </p>
<p>
       An active member may purchase a fraction of a year of domestic federal service to be credited as service under this subchapter in the manner as provided for domestic federal service under subsection (b) of this section if the service meets the following requirements:
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The member has not less than one-fourth (¼) year of domestic federal service in a fiscal year under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-601" target="_self">24-7-601</a></cite>; and

      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   However, the board shall not implement this section until the system has reduced its unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities being amortized over a period exceeding thirty (30) years to a level less than the standards prescribed for those public retirement systems under §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c01s24-1-104" target="_self">24-1-104</a></cite> and<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c01s24-1-105" target="_self">24-1-105</a></cite>.

<p>
      The monthly retirement benefit payable to retirants and beneficiaries of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System who were retired on or before July 1, 1978, and who were receiving benefits on July 1, 1979, shall be increased as follows:
     </p>
<p>
      For all benefits to retirants and beneficiaries of the system whose total credited service is before July 1, 1961, a monthly benefit increase equal to one dollar ($1.00) per each year of credited service;
     </p>
<p>
      For all benefits to retirants and beneficiaries of the system which are based in whole or in part upon credited service rendered after July 1, 1961, a monthly benefit increase equal to seventy-five cents (75¢) per each year of credited service;
     </p>
<p>
      For retirements effective after July 1, 1978, for which a monthly benefit is payable for the month of July 1981 or later, calculations shall be made as provided in subdivisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section. If the monthly benefit calculated using subdivision (b)(1) of this section is more than the monthly benefit calculated using subdivision (b)(2) of this section, then the difference shall be paid to the retirant as a monthly benefit increase, subject to the provisions of subdivisions (b)(3)-(6) of this section, as follows:

</p><p>
   Calculate the monthly annuity payable to the member under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-705" target="_self">24-7-705</a></cite>, based on the provisions of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-705" target="_self">24-7-705</a></cite>, his or her salary record, and his or her service record, all as of July 1, 1978, and add seventy-five cents (75¢) for each year of the member's credited service rendered before July 1, 1978;

   Calculate the monthly annuity payable to the member under the provisions of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-705" target="_self">24-7-705</a></cite> in effect at the time of the member's retirement;
     </p>
<p>
      For benefit increases authorized by this subsection, fractional years of service shall be disregarded. The increase shall be added to the monthly annuity after the annual postretirement increase based on the consumer price index has been applied to the retirant's base annuity;
     </p>

Emergency clause provided: “It is found that Arkansas colleges now need to recruit many teachers and staff members to accommodate the ever-growing number of students who enroll; that competition for the services of high class educators and staff members has developed; that in making a choice of employment, teachers and staff members place much stress on the adequacy and transportability of pension and retirement benefits; that in order to retain teachers and staff members who are now employed, and in order to employ new teachers and staff members of high quality, it is necessary that Arkansas offer, with as little delay as possible, a retirement plan which will prove acceptable. Now, therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

It is further found and determined that the present wording of subparagraph (1) of paragraph (d) of Section 4 of Act 436 of 1967 as amended is causing confusion about the intent of the General Assembly, and that there is uncertainty in administration of this provision of law and clarification of this provision is needed.

</p><p>
   (1)The member's participation in the Teacher Deferred Retirement Option Plan shall cease when the member files an application for voluntary retirement with the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-701" target="_self">24-7-701</a></cite> and is granted a monthly retirement benefit by the system.
     </p>
<p>
      The system shall cancel a plan participant's retirement benefits, and the plan participant forfeits any retirement benefits, including plan account benefits, if the participant:
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   Fails to meet the termination of employment requirement of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-701" target="_self">24-7-701</a></cite>; and
     </p>
<p>
      Has not reached normal retirement age.
     </p>
<p>
      A plan participant becomes eligible again for retirement benefits, including plan account benefits, when the termination requirements are met.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)When the member's participation in the plan ceases, the member may elect to:
     </p>
<p>
      Receive the balance in the plan account as a lump sum;
     </p>
<p>
      Annuitize the plan account as a monthly benefit paid under the annuity option selected by the member; or
     </p>
<p>
      Receive a part of the balance in the plan account as a lump sum and annuitize the remaining balance.
     </p>
<p>
      A member who selects the option under subdivision (b)(1)(C) of this section may receive his or her account distribution as follows:
     </p>
<p>
      Seventy-five percent (75%) in a lump-sum payment and twenty-five percent (25%) annuitized;
     </p>
<p>
      Fifty percent (50%) in a lump-sum payment and the remaining fifty percent (50%) annuitized; or
     </p>
<p>
      Twenty-five percent (25%) in a lump-sum payment and seventy-five percent (75%) annuitized.
     </p>
<p>
      The Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System shall:
     </p>
<p>
      Determine factors to be used for the conversion of plan balances to monthly amounts;
     </p>
<p>
      Set requirements for the member's election under this subsection; and
     </p>
<p>
      Modify the options under subdivision (b)(1) of this section by rule as necessary.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   When the member's participation in the plan ceases, the board shall cause the member's plan benefit to be paid directly to the member in the form of regular monthly amounts in the same amount and manner as would have been the case if the member had retired on the plan date and had made the same election under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-706" target="_self">24-7-706</a></cite> that was made on or before the plan date.

      (1)A member who fails to meet the termination requirements and receives retirement benefits shall repay any benefits received before becoming eligible again for voluntary retirement.

      If the member becomes eligible to receive the plan account distribution before the system collects it back from the member, the system may charge interest on the distribution for the time the member was ineligible to receive the distribution.

         Confusion about the intent of the General Assembly concerning the coverage of employees of state-supported universities, colleges, junior colleges, and vocational-technical schools, the Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Division of Career and Technical Education, the Adult Education Section, the Office of Skills Development, and Arkansas Rehabilitation Services, and any other entity offering both the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System retirement plan and an alternate retirement plan create uncertainty in the administration of law, and legislative clarification of the law is needed.
        </li>
<li id="t24c07sc15ol2f3">
         Beginning with legislation in 1967 and continuing through the early 1980s, the General Assembly created a right for certain colleges, vocational-technical schools, and the Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Board to establish and maintain an alternate retirement plan for its employees and perform all the functions reasonably appropriate in the retirement plan's administration.
        </li>
<li id="t24c07sc15ol2f4">
         The general intent of the early legislation was to allow those institutions of higher education employers to offer their employees the option to participate in an alternative retirement plan, the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System retirement plan, or the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System retirement plan.
        </li>
<li id="t24c07sc15ol2f5">
         The law was designed to encourage recruitment of public school teachers and administrators into postsecondary positions by allowing them to continue in the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and to encourage recruitment of private and out-of-state educators by the use of the alternate retirement plan that is offered nationwide.

           Whether an institution of higher education employer can exclude a part-time employee from participation in the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and thereby be exempt from reporting salary and remitting member or employer contributions for its part-time employees; and

<li id="t24c07sc15ol2f5B">
           Whether a retired Arkansas Teacher Retirement System member can be enrolled in the institution of higher education employer's alternate retirement plan with or without separation while simultaneously drawing retirement benefits from the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System.
           <p>
            The Attorney General's Opinion No. 2009-164, dated March 16, 2010, concludes that the current laws related to the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System are difficult to understand, as the intent of the General Assembly is not clear, and legislative clarification is required.

<p>
       (1)Historically, the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System has been mandated by the General Assembly to provide retirement benefits for an employee of a public school, public educational agency, or any other eligible employer included for coverage in the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System.
      </p>
<p>
       Originally, the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System was designed to provide retirement benefits to certified teachers and administrators in the public schools. However, the coverage has gradually been extended to all employees of the public schools and to other public entities that support educational activities in Arkansas.
      </p>
<p>
       (1)The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System requested an Attorney General's opinion for legal clarification, as the laws have been amended over time making the wording difficult to interpret.
      </p>
<p>
       All public school employees are mandatory members of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System as a condition of employment. The uncertainty is with employees of institutions of higher education employers, specifically:
      </p>
<p>
       Protect the retirement benefits for employees of the public school system;
      </p>
<p>

      The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System Act, referred to in this section, is codified throughout Title 24, Chapter 7.
   See Publisher’s Note to § 24-7-1603.
     </h3>
<p>
      (1)A PSHE employer shall adopt and record a policy or designation that identifies which positions at the PSHE employer's institution of higher education are benefits-eligible for retirement benefits.
     </p>
<p>
      A new employee of a PSHE employer may participate in the PSHE plan if the employee:
     </p>
<p>
      Is benefits-eligible as determined by the PSHE employer;
     </p>
<p>
      Is a vested member of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System at the time of initial employment;
     </p>
<p>
      Is not a vested member of the system but meets the requirements of a less restrictive PSHE plan adopted by the specific PSHE employer; and
     </p>
<p>
      Signs an irrevocable PSHE plan participation form provided by the system.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)A nonmandatory employer becomes a PSHE employer upon enrolling a new eligible member with the system on or after July 1, 2011.
     </p>
<p>
      A PSHE plan employee shall continue as a member in the system retirement plan so long as the member is employed by a PSHE employer.
     </p>
<p>
      An election to participate in the retirement system plan under this subsection is irrevocable so long as the employee does not obtain a termination refund from the system after the election.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)(A)A PSHE employer may adopt a resolution that allows a new employee to participate as a PSHE plan employee without being vested in the system.
     </p>
<p>
      (i)A less restrictive plan is effective when the resolution adopted by a PSHE employer is presented to the system.
     </p>
<p>
      A PSHE employer may modify a less restrictive PSHE plan at any time.
     </p>
<p>
      A less restrictive plan adopted by a PSHE employer before July 1, 2013, may provide that a new employee hired between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2013, who was prohibited from participating as a PSHE employee in the system and who would have been eligible under the less restrictive plan adopted by the PSHE plan employer may have an opt-in opportunity to participate in the system.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)A PSHE employer may adopt an opt-in opportunity as provided under subdivision (c)(1)(B)(iii) of this section by resolution adopted by the governing body of the PSHE employer that allows a benefits-eligible employee who was prohibited from becoming a member of the system from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2013, because the benefits-eligible employee was not a vested member of the system at the time of initial employment.
     </p>
<p>
      To participate in the opt-in opportunity provided by a PSHE employer, an employee shall:
     </p>
<p>
      Have been continuously employed by the PSHE employer once hired after July 1, 2011;
     </p>
<p>
      Meet the PSHE employer's less restrictive PSHE plan; and
     </p>
<p>
      Elect to become a member of the system between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)A benefits-eligible employee who elects to become a member of the system as provided under subdivision (c)(2) of this section may purchase service credit based on the applicable member employee and employer contribution rates on annual salary plus eight percent (8%) annual interest if the election is made between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014.
     </p>
<p>
      A purchase of service credit under subdivision (c)(3)(A) of this section shall be paid in full within one (1) year of the date that the benefits-eligible member elects to become a member of the system.
     </p>
<p>
      If a PSHE employer does not adopt a less restrictive plan, the PSHE plan shall remain in effect as provided under subsection (a) of this section.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)If a benefits-eligible employee at a PSHE employer was prohibited from becoming a member of the system from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2013, because the benefits-eligible employee was not a vested member of the system at the time of employment, and the benefits-eligible employee has been continuously employed by the PSHE employer, then the benefits-eligible employee may elect to become a member of the system between July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014.
     </p>
<p>
      A benefits-eligible employee who elects to become a member of the system under subdivision (c)(1) of this section may purchase service credit based on the applicable member and employer contributions rates on annual salary plus eight percent (8%) annual interest using a special formula if the election is made between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014, and is paid in full within one (1) year of the date the benefits-eligible member elects to become a member of the system.

      It is declared to be the state's public policy that chancery and circuit court judges and justices of the Supreme Court may retire or be retired when that course appears to be in the best interest of the official concerned and for the public welfare. Factors suggesting the desirability of retirement are physical disability, advanced age, or other infirmities calculated to materially impair usefulness. In addition, it is the public policy of the state to provide sufficient retirement and survivors' benefits for the chancery and circuit court judges and justices of the Supreme Court of the state to attract and retain highly capable members of the legal profession for service in the state judiciary.

        This section and § 24-8-710 impose neither a direct nor an indirect qualification for holding judicial office and do not prohibit any judge from holding office past age 70; if elected past age 70, no judge is subject to being ousted from his or her position as a result of the statutes, but instead, the laws pertain only to a judge's eligibility to receive retirement benefits, which are, after all, a matter of grace bestowed by the General Assembly.

       </h5>
<h5>
        Eligibility for benefits demonstrably is not the equivalent of a qualification for holding judicial office, and this section and § 24-8-710 do not constitute an additional qualification in contravention of the constitution; accordingly, the statutes do not violate Ark. Const. amend. 80, § 16.

</div>
<div>
<h5>
        This section and § 24-8-710 are rationally related to the achievement of legitimate state objectives, and that the laws are under-inclusive by allowing a few to briefly evade their strictures provides no reason to hold them unconstitutional; the General Assembly could conclude, without being arbitrary, that allowing some to serve a short time to achieve eligibility for retirement is to place repose and confidence in the voters to not elect as a first-time judge one who is past the prime of his or her abilities.
   Landers v. Stone, 2016 Ark. 272, 496 S.W.3d 370 (2016).
       </h5>
<h5>
        This section and § 24-8-710 bear a rational relationship to legitimate legislative purposes and advance the State's interest in protecting and maintaining the integrity of the judiciary; thus, it is not irrational for the State to promote retirement at an advanced age in order to attain the highest possible standards for the judiciary, and encouraging voluntary retirement eliminates the unpleasantness of selectively removing aged and disabled judges through formal disciplinary proceedings.
   Landers v. Stone, 2016 Ark. 272, 496 S.W.3d 370 (2016).
       </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
        Promoting voluntary retirement advances the State's legitimate interest in maintaining high performance for the judiciary by providing greater opportunities for younger attorneys to take the bench; the retirement system also substantially increases judicial manpower by bringing in younger judges while retaining the part-time services of willing and able retired judges.
   Landers v. Stone, 2016 Ark. 272, 496 S.W.3d 370 (2016).
       </h5>
<h5>
        This section and § 24-8-710 are not an unconstitutional taking without due process because judges provided no argument showing that the circuit court erred in denying their due-process claim by relying on the executive director's assurance that contributions would be refunded if a judge remained in office past age 70.

       (1)Any person desiring to apply for and draw benefits provided for in this section shall make application to the Auditor of State.
      </p>
<p>
       The application shall be supported and accompanied by proof satisfactory to the Auditor of State that the applicant is an unmarried spouse, sixty-five (65) years of age or older, of a person who served either on the Supreme Court, as a judge of the Court of Appeals, or as a circuit or chancery judge for a period of eight (8) years or longer, and that the applicant was married to the deceased justice or judge for at least five (5) years, was married to him or her at the time of his or her death, and was living with him or her in marriage at the time of his or her death.
      </p>
<p>
       Upon receipt of the application and proof, the Auditor of State shall determine the total amount of compensation received by the deceased judge subsequent to July 1, 1953, and shall compute four percent (4%) of that amount as the amount the applicant shall pay to the Auditor of State if the applicant desires to qualify for survivor benefits under the system as permitted in this section.

       The Auditor of State shall also determine the amount which would have been paid to the applicant had the deceased spouse been qualified under the system.

      Ark. Const., Am. 80, § 19(A)(2) provided that all circuit, chancery, and circuit-chancery judges “in office at the time this amendment takes effect shall continue in office as Circuit judges . . .” Amendment 80 further provided in § 19(B)(1) that the circuit courts would “assume the jurisdiction of Circuit, Chancery, Probate and Juvenile Courts.” Amendment 80 also provides that many of the lower courts will combine into district courts. The first portion of Amendment 80, § 19(B)(2) states: “District Courts shall have the jurisdiction vested in Municipal Courts, Corporation Courts, Police Courts, Justice of the Peace Courts, and Courts of Common Pleas at the time this Amendment takes effect. District Courts shall assume the jurisdiction of these courts of limited jurisdiction and other jurisdiction conferred in this Amendment on January 1, 2005.”

       24-8-701. Legislative history, findings, and intent.
      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      It is found and determined by the General Assembly that the creation of the Tier Two Actual Judicial Service Benefit Plan is part of a history of judicial retirement legislation that has sought to develop a more equitable retirement system for judges and thereby remove the need for judges to be involved in the political process through lobbying for retirement benefits and privileges.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)At one time member contributions were not sufficient to fund the system and therefore it was necessary for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and other members of the judicial system to ask the General Assembly for funds to pay benefits for retired judges and justices. In 1983 the need for members of the judiciary to be involved in the political process was reduced by the establishment of an actuarial funding method and by transfer of the administration of the Arkansas Judicial Retirement System to the Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System.
     </p>
<p>
      Initially the Arkansas Judicial Retirement System allowed a judge with fifteen (15) years of elective service to retire upon reaching age sixty-five (65). However, this system was awkward and some judges with many years of service did not qualify for benefits because the system did not provide for graduated benefits. Because of this “all or nothing” plan, the law has been amended a number of times to help judges qualify for benefits through use of credited service.
     </p>
<p>
      The use of credited service substantially changed the Arkansas Judicial Retirement System. The system was changed to allow an active member with ten (10) years of credited service to retire upon reaching age sixty-five (65) and to allow other members with twenty (20) years of credited service to retire regardless of age, or a member with fourteen (14) years of service to retire upon reaching age sixty-five (65). At the time of the passage of this act, the average retirement benefit paid by the Arkansas Judicial Retirement System was based on approximately twelve (12) years of actual service.
     </p>
<p>
      The reasons for including credited service are not as strong as they once were because reciprocity exists among state-supported retirement systems. A judge with military service and who is employed or becomes employed in a position covered by another state-supported retirement system may obtain credited service in the other system for that military service.
     </p>
<p>
      In 1997 legislation was adopted to authorize the establishment of a judicial deferred retirement option plan. The legislation was enacted in response to the average retirement benefit paid by the Arkansas Judicial Retirement System being based on only twelve (12) years of actual service. The legislature sought to encourage longer actual service by judges and justices.
     </p>
<p>
      For two (2) years the Joint Committee on Public Retirement and Social Security Programs and the Arkansas Judicial Council discussed ways to establish a fair retirement system and to eliminate the need for members of the judicial system to be involved in the political process in order to obtain equitable treatment. It was agreed that the Arkansas Judicial Retirement System had good benefits but that other aspects of the system needed revision. After discussion and negotiation between the Joint Committee on Public Retirement and Social Security Programs and the Arkansas Judicial Council it was agreed that the authorization for a judicial deferred retirement option plan should be repealed and that a new system judicial retirement plan should be established that would be based on actual service and which would provide graduated benefits for judges and justices.

<h5>
        This section and § 24-8-215 are rationally related to the achievement of legitimate state objectives, and that the laws are under-inclusive by allowing a few to briefly evade their strictures provides no reason to hold them unconstitutional; the General Assembly could conclude, without being arbitrary, that allowing some to serve a short time to achieve eligibility for retirement is to place repose and confidence in the voters to not elect as a first-time judge one who is past the prime of his or her abilities.
   Landers v. Stone, 2016 Ark. 272, 496 S.W.3d 370 (2016).
       </h5>
<h5>
        This section and § 24-8-215 bear a rational relationship to legitimate legislative purposes and advance the State's interest in protecting and maintaining the integrity of the judiciary; thus, it is not irrational for the State to promote retirement at an advanced age in order to attain the highest possible standards for the judiciary, and encouraging voluntary retirement eliminates the unpleasantness of selectively removing aged and disabled judges through formal disciplinary proceedings.
   Landers v. Stone, 2016 Ark. 272, 496 S.W.3d 370 (2016).
       </h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
        Promoting voluntary retirement advances the State's legitimate interest in maintaining high performance for the judiciary by providing greater opportunities for younger attorneys to take the bench; the retirement system also substantially increases judicial manpower by bringing in younger judges while retaining the part-time services of willing and able retired judges.
   Landers v. Stone, 2016 Ark. 272, 496 S.W.3d 370 (2016).
       </h5>
<h5>
        This section and § 24-8-215 are not an unconstitutional taking without due process because judges provided no argument showing that the circuit court erred in denying their due-process claim by relying on the executive director's assurance that contributions would be refunded if a judge remained in office past age 70.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Ninth General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the disability retirement provisions of the Arkansas Local Police and Fire Retirement System law conflicts with federal laws; that any conflict between federal laws and state laws leads to costly litigation and attorneys' fees; and that changing the laws of the state of Arkansas to eliminate these conflicts in laws will promote the more efficient and effective use of state and local government funds in Arkansas.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-First General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the current Arkansas Local Police and Fire Retirement System law prevents disabled police and fire fighters from receiving the additional benefit of the social security benefits when they become disabled; that officers and firemen who earn eligibility for both of these benefits should be able to enjoy the coverage under both programs; and that the financial condition of some disabled police officers will be enhanced with this change in law becoming effective immediately. Therefore, in order to aid the financial condition of disabled public servants, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor.

Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2001.”

These retired police officers and, if deceased, their survivors are expected to pay for all kinds of expenses after their retirement, some which are unexpected and can be extremely expensive. A program by which the state can provide a modest annual supplement to retirement benefits to defray unexpected expenses for retired police officers and their survivors will benefit all local police officers, local governments, and all citizens of the state.”

<p>
       Revenues distributed to the State of Arkansas as general revenue are subject to the allocations in this section.
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (1)All taxes that are levied on insurers that are allocated to general revenues under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-213" target="_self">24-11-213</a></cite> may be allocated to the Fire Protection Premium Tax Fund, underfunded plans under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-217" target="_self">24-11-217</a></cite>, and then to general revenues.
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (A)For the 1999-2000 state fiscal year, six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) of the fire portion of funds transferred to general revenues under this section and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-213" target="_self">24-11-213</a></cite> shall be transferred to the Fire Protection Premium Tax Fund.
      </p>

</p><p>
   In all subsequent years fifty percent (50%) of the percentage increase in the amount allocated to general revenues under this section and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-213" target="_self">24-11-213</a></cite>, using the dollar amount allocated in fiscal year 1999-2000 as the baseline, shall be transferred to the Fire Protection Premium Tax Fund in addition to the six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) per year until the time that a cap of two million dollars ($2,000,000) annually is transferred to the Fire Protection Premium Tax Fund.
      </p>
<p>
       Thereafter, the annual transfer shall be set at two million dollars ($2,000,000).
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   After transfers are made to cover funds distributed under subsection (b) of this section and the portion of those premium taxes set aside for transfer to the State Police Retirement Fund under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c06s24-6-209ol1b" target="_self">24-6-209(b)</a></cite>, the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration is directed to make annual transfers from the police portion of the revenues to the Policemen's Pension Supplement Program Fund on or before July 25, 1999, and each year thereafter as certified by the Arkansas Fire and Police Pension Review Board on July 1 each year as the amount needed to pay the expenses of and to make payments to the eligible retired police officers and survivors under the Arkansas Policemen's Pension Supplement Program for the coming year of the program.
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   The amounts under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-217" target="_self">24-11-217</a></cite> shall be reduced proportionately so that the remainder portion for general revenue does not fall below four million dollars ($4,000,000).
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (1)(A)The factor applied to groups allocated under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-214ol1j" target="_self">24-11-214(j)</a></cite> is forty percent (40%).

   The factor applied to groups allocated under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-214ol1k" target="_self">24-11-214(k)</a></cite> is thirty percent (30%).
      </p>
<p>
       The factors under subdivision (e)(1) of this section may be reduced proportionately to meet the following criteria:
      </p>
<p>
       The general revenue portion resulting from this subsection does not fall below four million dollars ($4,000,000); and
      </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   If the amount resulting from the application of the percentages under subdivision (e)(1) of this section, the amounts in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, and the amounts described in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-217" target="_self">24-11-217</a></cite> in total reduce the general revenue portion of the allocation below four million dollars ($4,000,000), the amounts resulting from the percentages in this subsection take precedence.

</h3>
<p>
      (1)After being once approved by a majority of those voting on the question at any general or special election in any city of the first class or city of the second class, a tax not to exceed one (1) mill on the dollar upon the assessed value of the real and personal property of the city shall be levied annually by the city for the purpose of paying police officers' retirement salaries and pensions, as well as pensions to the surviving spouses and minor children of deceased police officers and the surviving spouses and minor children of deceased retired police officers.
     </p>
<p>
      The levy shall be made by the city council or other governing body of the city on or before the time fixed by law for levying county taxes, and the city council or other governing body shall make out and certify to the county clerk the rate of taxation levied by the municipal corporation on the real and personal property within the city.
     </p>
<p>
      The amount so certified shall be placed upon the tax book by the county clerk of the county and collected in the same manner that state and county taxes are collected and shall be turned over to the board of trustees of the policemen's pension and relief fund of the city.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (1)In those cities that do not have a policemen's pension and relief fund but that cover their police officers under the Arkansas Local Police and Fire Retirement System, the tax shall also be allowed when approved by a majority of qualified electors of the cities participating in any election on the question and held at a special election in accordance with §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.07.html#t07c11s7-11-201" target="_blank">7-11-201</a></cite> et seq. for the purpose of voting on the question.
     </p>
<p>
      The election may be held in connection with the first general city election following March 6, 1989, but the failure to submit at a city or other election shall not defeat the right of submission at any subsequent election.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   Upon the filing with the county board of election commissioners not later than ninety (90) days before the date of the election requested in a petition signed by twenty (20) or more qualified electors of the city affected and praying that the question of a policemen's pension be submitted, it shall be the duty of the county board of election commissioners to call the election in accordance with §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.07.html#t07c11s7-11-201" target="_blank">7-11-201</a></cite> et seq.
     </p>
<p>
      In the event that for any reason the question of the policemen's pension is not voted upon in the next general city election after March 6, 1989, the question may be submitted at a special election held in the city as provided in this subsection.
     </p>
<p>
      The question on the ballot shall be as follows:
     </p>
<p>
      The tax so levied shall not exceed one (1) mill on the dollar upon the assessed value of the real and personal property of the city or town.
     </p>
<p>
      Once so approved, the tax shall be levied and certified in the same manner as provided in this section and shall be collected and turned over to the city or town for the sole purpose of making payment for coverage of employees under the Arkansas Local Police and Fire Retirement System.
     </p>
<p>
      A vote on the question of the tax provided for in this section shall be had in the same manner that the Arkansas Constitution and laws of this state provide for the initiation of measures in municipalities.
     </p>
<p>
      The funds provided for in this section shall be supplemental and in addition to any funds provided for by any laws in effect at the time of passage of this section and shall become part of the policemen's pension and relief fund of the city and be administered by the board of trustees of the policemen's pension and relief fund for the same class of beneficiaries and in the same manner as prescribed by law.

<p>
      (a)The term “salary” may include the payments to a police officer for unused accrued sick leave not to exceed ninety (90) work days recorded on the records of the city or town as of the officer's date of retirement, provided the municipality agrees by ordinance to make adequate contributions to the fund to cover the additional costs for the benefits from the increased salary and the fund is judged by an actuarial determination to be actuarially sound.
     </p>
<p>
      The board of trustees of the local fund shall determine the actuarial costs of the payments for the unused accrued sick leave to the fund.

       24-11-423. Benefits — Disability retirement.
      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      (1)(A)If any member of a police department becomes physically or mentally permanently disabled and this fact is certified by a physician named by the local board of trustees, he or she shall be entitled to retire and receive a pension as provided herein. A member of the police department shall not be retired for disability for natural causes unless he or she has served at least five (5) years.
     </p>
<p>
      If the disabling injury or disease occurred while not actually performing work in gainful employment for the police department, the monthly benefit shall be equal to the benefit paid to normal service retirants.
     </p>
<p>
      (i)If, however, a police officer is injured in the line of duty, the monthly disability benefit shall either be equal to sixty-five percent (65%) of the salary attached to the rank held by the member of the police department or shall be equal to the benefit paid to normal service retirants, whichever is greater.
     </p>
<p>
      For purposes of this section, “injured in the line of duty” means to have sustained a disabling injury or disease that occurs while the member of the police department is conducting official police department operations or training to become a police officer.
     </p>
<p>
      The local board of trustees shall determine whether the disability occurred in the line of duty and may require any medical evidence, official reports, expert testimony, or other information to be supplied by the applicant in addition to the required physician's examination. The additional benefits provided in this subdivision (a)(1)(C) shall be effective for all qualifying applications first received by the local board of trustees on or after January 1, 1987.
     </p>
<p>
      For purposes of computing all benefits under this section, the term “salary” means regular salary only and shall not include overtime pay, payments for unused accrued sick leave or annual leave, or the cash value of any nonrecurring or unusual remuneration.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   A police officer retired for reasons of disability who has more than twenty (20) years of service shall also be entitled to receive any supplementary benefit for which he or she would otherwise be qualified under this section and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-422" target="_self">24-11-422</a></cite>.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)If a member of the police department is retired because of any disability and, if he or she shall have recovered from the disability, and this fact is certified by a physician, it shall be the duty of the local board of trustees to stop the payment of the pension and to place the member back in service in the police department.
     </p>
<p>
      The time of the member's retirement shall be considered as continuous service in the police department.

<p>
        (1)Upon an actuarial determination that the policemen's pension and relief fund will remain actuarially sound, the board of trustees of a local policemen's pension and relief fund of cities of the first class shall have the option to establish a vesting rights policy in its policemen's pension and relief fund.
       </p>
<p>
        The required actuarial valuation shall be made by the actuary employed by the Arkansas Fire and Police Pension Review Board, who shall then report the actuarial findings in writing to the board of trustees.
       </p>
<p>
        All costs for the actuarial valuation shall be borne by the local funds.
       </p>
<p>
        (1)If approved, the vesting policy shall provide that in the event a member with ten (10) years or more of credited service in the system ceases to be employed as a member of the department and does not withdraw his or her accumulated employee contributions to the system, the member shall be entitled to receive a pension upon reaching fifty-five (55) years of age and making application to the board of trustees.
       </p>
<p>
        The pensions shall be computed at two and one-half percent (2.5%) of salary at the time of separation from the department, multiplied by the number of years of credited service, not to exceed twenty (20) years.
       </p>
<p>
        Any member may elect to withdraw his or her accumulated contributions to the system at the time of separation from the department and to waive any pension rights the member may have earned in the system.

        This section shall not affect any other section of the policemen's pension and relief funds of cities of the first class.

<p>
      Retroactive application applies only if the member and employer contributions have been made under this chapter.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)When a member begins participation in the plan, the contribution of the police officer and the employer contribution shall continue to be paid.
     </p>

     </p>
<p>
      In a municipality having a population of twenty thousand (20,000) persons or less, municipal matching contributions for employees who elect the plan shall be credited in full to the policemen's pension and relief fund, and the contribution of the employee shall be credited to the member's plan account.
     </p>
<p>
      The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had the member elected to cease employment and receive service retirement and pension supplement payments made by the Arkansas Policemen's Pension Supplement Program shall be paid into the plan account.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)The member's monthly retirement benefit shall not change unless the plan receives a benefit increase.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (A)A member who participates in this plan shall earn interest at a rate of two (2) percentage points below the rate of return of the investment portfolio of the policemen's pension and relief fund as certified by the actuary under contract with the Arkansas Fire and Police Pension Review Board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t24c11s24-11-207" target="_self">24-11-207</a></cite>, but no less than the actuarial assumed interest rate as certified by the actuary.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Eighth General Assembly of the State of Arkansas meeting in the First Extraordinary Session of 1992 that an error was made in the legislative process of incorporating amendments into the language of Act 851 of 1991 and a scrivener's error was made in the course of writing the bill which eventually became Act 429 of 1991 and that the errors in language will create some confusion as to the meaning of Act 851 of 1991 and the effectiveness of Act 429 of 1991 and thereby affect the administration of justice in the municipal courts of those affected counties and the retirement benefits of those fireman's funds. Therefore, in order to correct the errant language and dispel any confusion as to the meaning of Act 851 of 1991 and to correct the scrivener's errors of Act 429 of 1991, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Therefore, in order to achieve the maximum use of municipal police officers' and fire fighters services, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

     </p>
<p>
      The levy shall be made by the city council or other governing body of the city on or before the time fixed by law for levying county taxes, and the city council or other governing body shall make out and certify to the county clerk the rate of taxation levied by the municipal corporation on the real and personal property within the city.

   The amount so certified shall be placed upon the tax book by the county clerk of the county and collected in the same manner that state and county taxes are collected.

     </p>
<p>
      Once so approved, the levy shall be certified in the same manner as provided in this section and shall be collected and turned over to the city for the sole purpose of payment for coverage of employees under the Arkansas Local Police and Fire Retirement System.
     </p>

       When any municipal official or municipal employee age fifty-five (55) or over who has completed twenty (20) years of service to the municipality and who is vested in the retirement system retires, the official or employee may continue to participate in the municipality's healthcare plan, receiving the same medical benefits and paying the same premium as active employees as long as the retired official or employee pays both employer and employee contributions to the healthcare plan.

        This section and § 24-12-130 do not prevent a city from contracting to pay retiree health insurance premiums; this section does not restrict a municipality's ability to offer its employees more or varied coverage, as § 24-12-130 clarifies.

       Acts 1999, No. 50, § 8: Feb. 11, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the present law pertaining to non-uniform employees pension and relief plans passed in 1949 is limited to cities which did not have pension and relief plans in place in 1949, and who subsequently passed millages to fund such plans. Cities since that time have instituted defined benefit plans and, more recently, defined contribution plans, in which employer and employee contributions, not milages, fund the plans. This Act authorizes cities with non-uniform employee pension plan funds in excess of $100,000, regardless of the method of funding the plans, to update their investment policies and rules consistent with the investment policies and rules enacted in Act 1194 of 1997 for state retirement systems. Such clarification should go into effect immediately in order for cities to take advantage, should they so choose, of the current favorable investment climate and strong economy to increase plan assets, to compete with private industry retirement benefits for qualified employees, and to increase the likelihood of employees retiring with adequate funds for their retirement years. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
