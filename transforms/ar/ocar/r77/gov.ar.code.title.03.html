   Publisher's Notes. Acts 1935, No. 108, Art. 9, repealed all laws or parts of laws in conflict with the act, but provided that the act was not intended to repeal or conflict with the taxing provisions of Acts 1934 (2nd Ex. Sess.), Nos. 4 and 9, or Acts 1933 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 7. Additionally, the section stated that if there was a conflict between the taxing provisions, the provisions of the acts mentioned would govern. Acts 1934 (2nd Ex. Sess.), No. 4 was superseded by §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c05s3-5-401" target="_self">3-5-401</a></cite> et seq. [repealed]. Acts 1934 (2nd Ex. Sess.), No. 9 was superseded by §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c06s3-6-101" target="_self">3-6-101</a></cite> et seq. Acts 1933 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 7 is codified as ch. 5, subch. 2 of this title.

        The intent of the Arkansas Alcoholic Control Act is to classify beer having an alcoholic content of not more than 5% as a malt beverage as distinguished from malt liquor. McKeown v. State, 197 Ark. 454, 124 S.W.2d 19 (1939); Scurlock v. Central Distribs., Inc., 223 Ark. 954, 269 S.W.2d 790 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where city voted dry, the sale of beer with an alcoholic content of not more than 5% was also prohibited, notwithstanding the definitions contained in this section. McKeown v. State, 197 Ark. 454, 124 S.W.2d 19 (1939).

     Alcoholic content of a malt beverage controls in determining whether it should be taxed, regulated, and controlled as a “spirituous, vinous, and malt liquor” under this act and Acts 1935, No. 109, or as “beer and light wines” under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c05s3-5-201" target="_self">3-5-201</a></cite> et seq.Scurlock v.

This Alcoholic Beverage Control Board was abolished by Acts 1955, No. 113, § 1, and a new Alcoholic Beverage Control Board created within the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control by § 2 of that act. See §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c02s3-2-201" target="_self">3-2-201</a></cite>.
         </p>
         <p>
          Acts 1971, No. 38, § 5, in part transferred the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Department of Finance and Administration by a type 1 transfer and transferred the Enforcement Division of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, by a type 2 transfer, to the Department of Public Safety.
         </p>
         <p>
          Acts 1971, No. 38, § 5, further transferred the Department of Revenue which was created by Acts 1925, No. 88, as amended by Acts 1927, No. 115, and Acts 1953, No. 293, and its functions, powers, and duties to the Department of Finance and Administration. The section further provided that all references to the Department of Revenues and the Commissioner of Revenues would thereafter be deemed to refer to the Department of Finance and Administration and the Director of the Department of Finance and Administration.
         </p>
         <p>
          Acts 1981, No. 45, § 9, provided in part that the Enforcement Division was transferred from the Department of Public Safety to the Department of Finance and Administration and would be located in a separate division to be known as the Enforcement Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which division would function separately and apart from the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division. The section further provided that all the powers, functions, and duties added to the Enforcement Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control subsequent to the enactment of Acts 1971, No. 38, would be vested in the Enforcement Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control within the Department of Finance and Administration. The section stated that nothing in the 1981 act should be construed to reduce any right that an employee of the Enforcement Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control should have under any civil service or merit system.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a consequence of these transfers, the alcoholic beverage control laws, except with respect to collection of taxes, are currently administered by two divisions within the Department of Finance and Administration: the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforcement Division. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division is the primary administrative agency and supervises, regulates, and controls the manufacture, transportation, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforcement Division is the primary enforcement agency and, among other things, conducts inspections, investigates applicants for licenses, investigates permit violations, and confiscates illicit liquor. Each division is headed by its own director.
         </p>
         <p>
          <p>
       Pursuant to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c02s3-2-205" target="_self">3-2-205</a></cite>, the collection of taxes and permit and license fees is now the responsibility of the Director of the Department of Finance and Administration.

     Publisher's Notes. It is not clear whether this section now applies to the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division. In the years immediately prior to publication of this Code, the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division was, in actual practice, appointed by the Director of the Department of Finance and Administration with the approval of the Governor. Pursuant to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c02s3-2-203" target="_self">3-2-203</a></cite>, the head of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforcement Division is also appointed by the Director of the Department of Finance and Administration.

       <p>
        Although regulatory authority over alcoholic beverages is now divided between the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforcement Division, each of which has its own director, subsections (c) and (d) of this section may still apply to officers and employees of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board and the two regulatory divisions.

            The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board is vested with the power to determine whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted by granting permits and the director is authorized to promulgate regulations and has broad discretionary power to enforce such provisions.

            Evidence, standing alone, was too speculative to support the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board's denial of an off-premises beer permit based upon board's regulation that permitted premises promote public convenience and advantage; however, there was substantial evidence to support the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board's denial of an application for an off-premises beer permit based upon board's regulation requiring that adequate police protection be available to permitted premises. Copeland v. ABC Bd., 4 Ark. App. 143, 628 S.W.2d 588 (1982).

      The circuit judges of this state are declared to be primarily responsible for the enforcement of laws against the unlawful manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Circuit judges are given authority to appoint an officer of the court in lieu of the sheriff to act temporarily and in cases specially designated in the enforcing of any of the laws when the circuit judge becomes convinced that the sheriff is for any cause neglecting his or her duties under the law imposed upon him or her.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation and expenses of such temporary officer shall be fixed by the judge making the appointment and shall be ordered paid by the judge out of an appropriation hereafter made. A certified copy of the judgment of the court fixing the compensation and expenses shall be sufficient authority for the Auditor of State to draw a voucher in payment of the compensation and expenses and of the Treasurer of State to pay a warrant when presented. The voucher shall be preaudited as other claims against the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Whenever the circuit judge becomes convinced that any prosecuting attorney is not performing his or her full duty with respect to the enforcement of the laws against the unlawful manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors, he or she shall have authority to appoint a special prosecutor who shall be an attorney learned in the law and with at least ten (10) years' experience in the actual practice of law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The special prosecutor shall proceed to investigate and prosecute such cases as may be called to his or her attention by the circuit judge.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation and expenses of the special prosecutor shall be fixed by the circuit court and paid out of the fund hereafter appropriated. The order of the circuit judge fixing the compensation and expenses of the special prosecutor shall be sufficient authority upon which the Auditor of State may issue a voucher in payment thereof and of the Treasurer of State to pay a warrant when presented. The voucher shall be preaudited as other claims against the state.

If it is determined from the evidence educed at said hearing that the brand or label involved is the same as, or similar to, or is such a modification of, substitution of, upgrade of, or extension of a brand or label which has already been registered by the distiller, manufacturer, importer, or producer, so as to render it unjust or inequitable, without cause being shown, to designate the brand or label to a wholesaler different from the wholesaler designated for the brand or label being so modified, substituted, upgraded, or extended, then such request shall be denied; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed or prevent the distiller, manufacturer, importer, or producer from treating the matter as a desire to change wholesalers and from proceeding under the provisions of § 3-2-404, either before or after such determination.

       No proposed change will be approved by the director which is based upon the failure or refusal of a wholesaler to comply with any demand or request of a distiller, manufacturer, importer, or producer if such demand or request would result in a violation of any provision of federal or state law or regulation. During such fifteen-day objection period or until the proposed changes have been finally approved by the director, the party proposing the change shall continue to supply the designated wholesaler, upon commercially reasonable terms, such reasonable quantities of the brand involved as the wholesaler may require. If, at any time, the director finds a distiller, manufacturer, importer, or producer is not shipping the wholesaler a reasonable amount of merchandise, he or she may withdraw approval of all brands registered by such parties within the state.

          On appeal from conviction for possessing illegal liquor, evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the state. Marshall v. State, 205 Ark. 349, 168 S.W.2d 809 (1943).

       Writ of habeas corpus was not the proper remedy where prisoner was convicted under this section for selling liquor in a dry territory covered by §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c08s3-8-209" target="_self">3-8-209</a></cite>, since proper remedy was by appeal.

          In prosecution for possession of untaxed intoxicating liquor, evidence of prior conviction on similar charge was admissible. Burrell v. State, 203 Ark. 1124, 160 S.W.2d 218 (1942) (decision under prior law).

          For conviction under this section it is immaterial whether liquor obtained is liquor legally manufactured outside of state or liquor illegally manufactured within the state, if in fact the excise tax is not paid on the liquor. McHenry v. State, 219 Ark. 401, 242 S.W.2d 707 (1951).

          Imposition of fine and imprisonment was erroneous where language of indictment indicated offense was for selling liquor in dry territory instead of selling liquor without a license, hence defendant was subject only to a fine. Robbins v. State, 219 Ark. 664, 244 S.W.2d 156 (1951).

          A.C.R.C. Notes. The amendment to this section by Acts 2005, No. 1994, § 366, was superseded by the repeal of this section by Acts 2005, No. 541, § 1. As amended by Acts 2005, No. 1994, § 366, this section read:
         </p>
         <p>
          “3-3-207. Sales to persons failing to provide for families.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(a)Any person who shall sell intoxicating alcoholic liquor to any person who has been reported to the seller, by the juvenile court or any officer acting by its discretion, as failing to make a proper provision for his or her family shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor. The penalties prescribed herein shall be in addition to any other penalty prescribed by law.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(b)Any person found guilty a second time shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor.”
         </p>

          Publisher's Notes. This section, concerning sales of alcohol to persons failing to provide for families, was repealed by Acts 2005, No. 541, § 1. The section was derived from Acts 1943, No. 218, §§ 1, 2; A.S.A. 1947, §§ 48-901, 48-902.
         </p>

          Amendments. The 2005 amendment substituted “violation” for “misdemeanor” at the end of (a); substituted “Class A misdemeanor” for “misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or to imprisonment in the county jail for not less than thirty (30) days nor more than one (1) year, or subject to both fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court or jury” in (b)(2); and made gender neutral changes throughout.

          Section 3-3-306 [now repealed] making it unlawful to possess more than one gallon of intoxicating liquor in dry territory does not apply to prosecution for possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale in a dry territory, and the state in a prosecution does not have to prove that defendant had more than one gallon in his possession, as defendant violates the law if he has any liquor in his possession for sale in a dry territory. Jaynes v. State, 212 Ark. 410, 206 S.W.2d 7 (1947); Freeman v. State, 214 Ark. 359, 216 S.W.2d 864 (1949).

         <p>
          Instruction not limiting the findings of the jury to particular offense charged but authorizing verdict of guilty upon finding that defendant at any time within one year preceding the filing of the information had possession of liquor for purpose of sale was not reversible error where defendant did not ask for instruction limiting consideration of the jury to specific instance, nor instruction limiting scope of evidence of other similar offenses.

          Where defendant was arrested while carrying a bucket containing several bottles of corn whiskey, he could properly be charged and convicted for (1) possessing intoxicants for the purpose of sale, and (2) possessing untaxed liquor even though both offenses grew out of the same transaction.

       This section is not a dramshop act; therefore, the trial court did not err in ruling that as a matter of law there was no proximate cause between violation of this section prohibiting the sale of beer to a minor and the accident which occurred when a minor lost control of his vehicle while opening a bottle of beer. Milligan v. County Line Liquor, Inc., 289 Ark. 129, 709 S.W.2d 409 (1986), overruled, Shannon v. Wilson, 329 Ark. 143, 947 S.W.2d 349 (1997).

     </p>
     <p>
      “(d)The operator of any motor vehicle violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a violation and shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500).
     </p>
     <p>
      “(e)This section shall not be deemed to repeal any acts pertaining to possession of alcoholic beverages in dry territory, but shall be cumulative thereto.

      “3-3-306. Possession of alcoholic beverages other than beer.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(a)It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to possess more than one (1) gallon of spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors other than beer, in any county or part of a county in which it is unlawful to manufacture, sell, barter, loan, or give away intoxicating liquors.

        Publisher's Notes. This section was enacted when intoxicating liquor was prohibited in the entire state. Acts 1933 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 7, § 23, repealed it with respect to beer and light wine. Acts 1935, No. 108, Art. 3, § 18-A, repealed it “in its entirety, excepting only as to those counties in which the sale of alcoholic liquors may later be prohibited under the local option provisions.” Acts 1935, No. 108, Art. 3, § 18-A, further provided that it should not be “construed to prohibit the advertising of any alcoholic liquors legalized by this act in any newspaper within this state.”

       <p>
        Amendments. The 2005 amendment substituted “guilty of a Class B misdemeanor” for “fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100) and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each offense and may be confined not less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days in the county jail” in (e); and deleted former (f).

       Where information charged defendant with possession of unregistered “still and still worm,” defendant was not misled as to crime charged even though only possession of a still worm was shown since court made it plain by its instructions that defendant could be found guilty only of possession of a still worm.

       Where defendant was charged with possession of unregistered “still and still worm,” it did not matter that the still was not set up and therefore did not require registration with federal authorities since possession of the still worm was all that was required to be proved.

        Acts 1991, No. 606, § 14: July 1, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined that numerous persons who are resident aliens of the United States desire to operate establishments that dispense alcoholic beverages in the State of Arkansas and that the same are presently prohibited from obtaining a license in their name. It is further found and determined that the requirement of United States citizenship in order to maintain these establishments poses a burden upon commerce and restricts the number of persons who are able to contribute to the overall economy of the State of Arkansas. It is further found and determined that numerous national corporations are hindered in their operations in that they cannot have newly transferred managers or other key employees assume positions of responsibility within their local outlets since those persons do not meet the two (2) year residency requirement and that such requirement poses an unreasonable burden on the conduct of business in this state as it relates to alcohol beverage outlets. It is further found that the present process of applying for or renewing ABC licenses by requiring proof of payment of personal property taxes is cumbersome, unnecessary, and has no direct relationship to the operation of the ABC permitted outlet. It is further found and determined that there are presently numerous conflicting requirements which are applied to applicants for various retail licenses issued by the state ABC Division and that it is necessary and proper that such permit requirements be made uniform. That all of the aforementioned encumbrances are a burden on the transaction of commerce in the state and upon the efficient administration of government in the state. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1, 1991.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

        Acts 2011, No. 70, § 4: Feb. 18, 2011.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

            The effect of Acts 1983, No. 812 which amended this section was to establish a special privilege for people residing in the more populous counties, to the exclusion of others; therefore, the emergency clause appended to that act was unconstitutional under Ark. Const. Amend. 7, which prohibits emergencies in acts granting special privileges. Marshall v. Singleton, 282 Ark. 167, 666 S.W.2d 399 (1984).
           </p>
           <p>
            Action of the Commissioner of Revenues (now the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board) in refusing to grant a retail permit in a certain area is discretionary and when not arbitrary or discriminatory cannot be controlled by mandamus. Hardin v. Cassinelli, 204 Ark. 1016, 166 S.W.2d 258 (1942).
           </p>
           <p>
            The Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board are given broad discretionary powers to decide the number of permits and to issue them only when it is determined that public convenience and advantage would be promoted. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982); Ark. ABC Bd. v. Muncrief, 308 Ark. 373, 825 S.W.2d 816 (1992).
           </p>
           <p>
            The “public convenience and advantage” language of this section invests the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board with much discretionary leeway in deciding whether to approve an application for a transfer of a retail liquor outlet, and therefore where substantial evidence supports the board's decision, the Supreme Court must defer to the board's expertise and experience. Fayetteville School Dist. No. 1 v. ABC Bd., 279 Ark. 89, 648 S.W.2d 804 (1983).
           </p>
           <p>
            Factors to be considered by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board before issuing a permit to operate a private club include: (1) the number and types of alcoholic permits in the area; (2) economic impact; (3) traffic hazards; (4) remoteness of the area; (5) degree of law enforcement available; (6) input from law enforcement or other public officials in the area; and (7) comments from area residents in opposition or support of the permit. Moore v. King, 56 Ark. App. 21, 937 S.W.2d 677 (1997).
           </p>
           <p>
            In finding that the area was adequately served by the existing liquor stores nearby, the board was entitled to rely on the opinion of area residents and public officials that the existing liquor stores already served the public convenience, obviating the need for another. Vallaroutto v. ABC Bd., 81 Ark. App. 318, 101 S.W.3d 836 (2003).
           </p>
           <p>
            The failure to grant any permits in a city during a period of 12 years was not in and of itself arbitrary, where there was no evidence to indicate that the board had systematically denied applications in the area or even that such applications had been made. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if the board could or should have found that due to economic expansion an additional outlet was desirable, it was not required to grant a particular application for a specific location where the board found the location would disadvantage not only those utilizing the facility but the general public. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
           </p>
           <p>
            Board's decision denying permit was supported by substantial evidence. Johnson v. Ark. ABC Bd., 6 Ark. App. 366, 642 S.W.2d 335 (1982).
           </p>
           <p>
            There was substantial evidence to support board's action granting permit. Green v. Carder, 282 Ark. 239, 667 S.W.2d 660 (1984).
           </p>
           <p>
            Denial of application upheld, where predicated on the fact that the proposed location was unsuitable for transfer of the liquor and beer permits. Edwards v. ABC Div. Bd., 307 Ark. 245, 819 S.W.2d 271 (1991).
           </p>
           <p>
            The 1993 amendment of this section set forth detailed procedures for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to use in handling inactive permits; nothing in the amendment is inconsistent with the implementation of ABC Reg. § 1.80. Blann v. ABC Bd., 317 Ark. 97, 876 S.W.2d 258 (1994).
           </p>
           <p>
            The term “new permits” in subdivision (c)(2) of this section applies to a permit which increases the overall number of permits. Blann v. ABC Bd., 317 Ark. 97, 876 S.W.2d 258 (1994).
           </p>
           <p>
            Under this section no provision is made for dispensing liquors at retail for on-premises consumption and the issuance of such permits by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board was unauthorized by law and invalid. Hinton v. State ex rel. Purcell, 246 Ark. 341, 438 S.W.2d 57 (1969).
           </p>
           <p>
            There was not substantial evidence on the record to support a finding that the public convenience and advantage would not be served by issuance of retail liquor permit under this section. Snyder v. ABC Bd., 1 Ark. App. 92, 613 S.W.2d 126 (1981).
           </p>
           <p>
            Mere numbers of persons being either for or against the issuance of retail liquor permits is of no significance under this section and is insufficient to allow the board to conclude that the granting of permits would not be to the public convenience and advantage. Stringfellow v. ABC Bd., 3 Ark. App. 124, 623 S.W.2d 213 (1981).
           </p>
           <p>
            As security and public safety are factors to be considered in determining whether public convenience and advantage are to be promoted, the board properly considered testimony regarding the difficulty of police protection at a specific location. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
           </p>
           <p>
            The words “public convenience and advantage” should not be restricted to a colloquial sense as synonymous with “handy or easy of access” but construed in that sense which connotes suitable and fitting to supply the public needs to the public advantage. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982); Ark. ABC Bd. v. Muncrief, 308 Ark. 373, 825 S.W.2d 816 (1992).
           </p>
           <p>
            The reference to the “public convenience and advantage” in this section means that the interest of the general public is to be considered, not merely that of the applicant. Fayetteville School Dist. No. 1 v. ABC Bd., 279 Ark. 89, 648 S.W.2d 804 (1983); Ark. ABC Bd. v. Muncrief, 308 Ark. 373, 825 S.W.2d 816 (1992).
           </p>
           <p>
            The number of persons who object to, or support, the issuance of retail liquor permits is not significant under the statute; the reasons for the support or opposition may be very significant. Ark. ABC Bd. v. Muncrief, 308 Ark. 373, 825 S.W.2d 816 (1992).
           </p>
           <p>
            In a case where an application to operate a retail liquor store was conditionally granted, the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board had the statutory authority to enact rules and regulations. Therefore, the board had the authority to impose conditions on the approval of applications.Sheppard v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2014 Ark. App. 604, 447 S.W.3d 614 (2014).
           </p>
           <p>
            Former provision authorizing the circuit court in a trial de novo to redetermine or disregard the factual base upon which the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board relied to issue a liquor license was unconstitutional because such a trial sanctioned judicial encroachment into an area constitutionally reserved to the executive branch of government in the exercise of its executive discretion pursuant to this section. Goodall v. Williams, 271 Ark. 354, 609 S.W.2d 25 (1980).

            The effect of Acts 1983, No. 812 which amended this section is to establish a special privilege for people residing in the more populous counties, to the exclusion of others; therefore, the emergency clause appended to that act is unconstitutional under Ark. Const. Amend. 7, which prohibits emergencies in acts granting special privileges. Marshall v. Singleton, 282 Ark. 167, 666 S.W.2d 399 (1984).

            Supreme Court of Arkansas holds that, so long as the spouses sufficiently divest themselves of any interest in the other's permit, there is nothing in the current language of this section that automatically prohibits both partners in a marriage from holding separate liquor permits.Moore v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2016 Ark. 422, 503 S.W.3d 796 (2016).

            Alcoholic Beverage Control Board's determination that this section was not violated by virtue of the competitor and her husband having independent interests in separate liquor permits was supported by substantial evidence.Moore v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2016 Ark. 422, 503 S.W.3d 796 (2016).
           </p>
           <p>
            Competitor's testimony before the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board and the relinquishments she signed were substantial evidence that supported the Board's determination that she sufficiently divested herself of her interest in holdings that included a retail liquor permit so as not to run afoul of the requirements of this section.Moore v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2016 Ark. 422, 503 S.W.3d 796 (2016).
           </p>
           <p>
            Competitor's lease arrangement with a building owned by a corporation in which her husband held an interest was not a basis to overturn the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board's decision granting the competitor a retail liquor permit. Even if the arrangement violated this section, the violation would have been on the part of the husband, not the competitor, as he was the one with the interest in the corporation that owned both the building and a separate liquor permit, and the competitor's and her husband's interests in their respective permits were separate.Moore v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2016 Ark. 422, 503 S.W.3d 796 (2016).

            Where competitor challenged the transfer of a retail liquor permit, contending that the transferee held an interest in two permits at the same time in violation of this section, substantial evidence supported the finding that the transferee was qualified to replace the original permit holder; the transferee's original permit was only a conditional permit, he had never operated a liquor store under that permit, and he expressed his intention to contemporaneously relinquish that permit when the Board issued the subject permit.Gildehaus v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2016 Ark. 414, 503 S.W.3d 789 (2016).

         The language of this section is obviously applicable to the retail liquor business and complements §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c04s3-4-604" target="_self">3-4-604</a></cite>. When the two statutes are read together it is obvious that the legislature intended to prevent retail “package” stores from operating within 200 yards of a school or church building. Rowell v. Austin, 276 Ark. 445, 637 S.W.2d 531 (1982).
           </p>
           <p>
            The word “church” means the place where a body of people or worshipers associate together for religious purposes; in a statute or regulation, the word is to be given its usual and ordinary meaning. Ark. ABC Div. v. Person, 309 Ark. 588, 832 S.W.2d 249 (1992) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
           <p>
            Fact that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board granted a permit for another retail liquor business to locate within 200 yards of a church in violation of this section did not make the action of the board arbitrary when it refused to approve a similar location, since it is not arbitrary for a governmental agency to refuse to make the same error twice. Ark. ABC Div. v. Person, 309 Ark. 588, 832 S.W.2d 249 (1992).
           </p>
           <p>
            The prohibition of this section would not apply to the transfer of a private club permit for dispensation of alcoholic beverages by the drink or in broken or unsealed containers for consumption on the premises. Jones v. Reed, 267 Ark. 237, 590 S.W.2d 6 (1979).
           </p>
           <p>
            Regulations may differentiate between “package” stores and private clubs. Ark. ABC Div. v. Person, 309 Ark. 588, 832 S.W.2d 249 (1992).
           </p>
           <p>
            Waiver of this section by a church is ineffective since the section expresses the public policy of this state, and a waiver by a church congregation does not change the state's public policy. Ark. ABC Div. v. Person, 309 Ark. 588, 832 S.W.2d 249 (1992).

     Publisher's Notes.

       <p>
        Amendments. The 2017 amendment, in the introductory language, substituted “The following persons” for “No”, and substituted “not receive a permit under this title” for “receive a permit”; substituted “an excluded felony” for “a felony” in (1); substituted “title” for “act” in (5) and twice in (6); and deleted “shall have” following “person who” in (5).

       Applications for new permits will be accepted by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division after the publication of new census figures if the applications are warranted within a county or subdivision thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t03c04s3-4-208ol1b">
       When it has been determined that new applications are appropriate, thedivision shall notify the public at large by legal notice that it will be accepting applications for a particular county or political subdivision thereof.

       Applications will then be accepted from the affected area beginning thirty (30) days after the date of publication, and no applications will be accepted after ninety (90) days of the publication date.

      <li id="t03c04s3-4-208ol1d">
       All applications received from the affected area will then be processed and set for an Alcoholic Beverage Control Board meeting. The board meeting shall not be earlier than one hundred fifty (150) days after the publication of the legal notice specified in subsection (b) of this section, nor later than one hundred eighty (180) days after publication.

      <li id="t03c04s3-4-208ol1e">
       No later than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, each applicant for a new permit or his or her agent will be allowed to draw a number between one (1) and a number equal to the number of applicants having filed. The drawing will be conducted by the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division. Position numbers may not be assigned or transferred.
      </li>
      <li id="t03c04s3-4-208ol1f">

         No permit will issue earlier than thirty (30) days subsequent to the determination or until such time as the board determines it is necessary for final adjudication in the Arkansas courts, of any appeals arising out of such determinations, whichever is longer.

       The provisions of this section shall apply only to applications for permits to dispense vinous (except wines), spirituous, or malt liquor filed with the board after July 4, 1983.
       <p>
        The effect of Acts 1983, No. 812 which amended this section is to establish a special privilege for people residing in the more populous counties, to the exclusion of others; therefore, the emergency clause appended to that act is unconstitutional under Ark. Const. Amend. 7, which prohibits emergencies in acts granting special privileges. Marshall v. Singleton, 282 Ark. 167, 666 S.W.2d 399 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action of the Commissioner of Revenues (now the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board) in refusing to grant a retail permit in a certain area is discretionary and when not arbitrary or discriminatory cannot be controlled by mandamus. Hardin v. Cassinelli, 204 Ark. 1016, 166 S.W.2d 258 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board are given broad discretionary powers to decide the number of permits and to issue them only when it is determined that public convenience and advantage would be promoted. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The “public convenience and advantage” language of this section invests the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board with much discretionary leeway in deciding whether to approve an application for a transfer of a retail liquor outlet, and therefore where substantial evidence supports the board's decision, the Supreme Court must defer to the board's expertise and experience. Fayetteville School Dist. No. 1 v. ABC Bd., 279 Ark. 89, 648 S.W.2d 804 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judging both the credibility of witnesses and the proper weight to be accorded evidence presented to the board is within the board's domain. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        While hearsay standing alone is not substantial evidence, it may be considered by the board in reaching its determination if supportive of other nonhearsay evidence. The weight to be given such evidence is for the board to determine. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        As security and public safety are factors to be considered in determining whether public convenience and advantage are to be promoted, the board properly considered testimony regarding the difficulty of police protection at a specific location. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The board was not required to find that the issuance of a new permit would have an adverse effect on any existing permit; it was required to find only whether the issuance of the additional permit in this area would “promote the public convenience and advantage.” Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure to grant any permits in a city during a period of 12 years was not in and of itself arbitrary, where there was no evidence to indicate that the board had systematically denied applications in the area or even that such applications had been made. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the board could or should have found that due to economic expansion an additional outlet was desirable, it was not required to grant a particular application for a specific location where the board found the location would disadvantage not only those utilizing the facility but the general public. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Board's decision denying permit was supported by substantial evidence. Johnson v. Ark. ABC Bd., 6 Ark. App. 366, 642 S.W.2d 335 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial evidence to support board's action granting permit. Green v. Carder, 282 Ark. 239, 667 S.W.2d 660 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section no provision is made for dispensing liquors at retail for on-premises consumption and the issuance of such permits by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board was unauthorized by law and invalid. Hinton v. State ex rel. Purcell, 246 Ark. 341, 438 S.W.2d 57 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was not substantial evidence on the record to support a finding that the public convenience and advantage would not be served by issuance of retail liquor permit under this section. Snyder v. ABC Bd., 1 Ark. App. 92, 613 S.W.2d 126 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere numbers of persons being either for or against the issuance of retail liquor permits is of no significance under this section and is insufficient to allow the board to conclude that the granting of permits would not be to the public convenience and advantage. Stringfellow v. ABC Bd., 3 Ark. App. 124, 623 S.W.2d 213 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The words “public convenience and advantage” should not be restricted to a colloquial sense as synonymous with “handy or easy of access” but construed in that sense which connotes suitable and fitting to supply the public needs to the public advantage. Carder v. Hemstock, 5 Ark. App. 115, 633 S.W.2d 384 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The reference to the “public convenience and advantage” in this section means that the interest of the general public is to be considered, not merely that of the applicant. Fayetteville School Dist. No. 1 v. ABC Bd., 279 Ark. 89, 648 S.W.2d 804 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where an application to operate a retail liquor store was conditionally granted, the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board had the statutory authority to enact rules and regulations. Therefore, the board had the authority to impose conditions on the approval of applications.Sheppard v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2014 Ark. App. 604, 447 S.W.3d 614 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former provision authorizing the circuit court in a trial de novo to redetermine or disregard the factual base upon which the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board relied to issue a liquor license was unconstitutional because such a trial sanctioned judicial encroachment into an area constitutionally reserved to the executive branch of government in the exercise of its executive discretion pursuant to this section. Goodall v. Williams, 271 Ark. 354, 609 S.W.2d 25 (1980).

      (1)No new liquor permits shall be issued to nor shall any outstanding liquor permit be transferred to any person, firm, or corporation by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division wherein the permitted premises of the liquor permittee is operated as a part of the profit-making business of any drug, grocery, sporting goods, dry goods, hardware, or general mercantile store.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the permittee may have tobacco products, mixers, soft drinks, consumables and edible products that complement alcoholic beverages, and other items customarily associated with the retail package sale of the liquors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The division shall promulgate rules to facilitate the sale of complementary products under subdivision (a)(2) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, this restriction shall not prohibit the transfer of a permit by the division resulting from the sale of a business for which a permit was issued on or before February 18, 1971.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further provided that in any instance where a retail liquor permit was issued after February 18, 1971, and the permitted premise is located outside an incorporated city or town and is located within five (5) miles of two (2) other liquor stores that were grandfathered in under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, with each of the other stores being on either side of the newer liquor store, further where the newer liquor store and one (1) of the grandfathered liquor stores are both located in the same county and the second grandfathered liquor store is located in an adjoining county, and further where all three (3) subject liquor stores are located within one (1) mile of a federal interstate highway, then the middle liquor store may be considered as a grandfathered liquor store on the same basis as its competitors and may sell items which would not ordinarily be allowed if the permit were granted after February 18, 1971.

          State's authority to revoke a license to sell liquor does not violate any constitutional rights of a permittee because the license is a privilege and not a contract with the state to which property rights inure; the license is a privilege to do what would otherwise be a violation of criminal law and is not a matter of right but of legislative grace. Blum v. Ford, 194 Ark. 393, 107 S.W.2d 340 (1937).
         </p>
         <p>
          The Commissioner of Revenues (now the Director of Alcoholic Beverage Control Division), after he has made an investigation which shows a violation of the law, may cancel a permit, but he cannot do so arbitrarily, and the dealer may appeal his action. Blum v. Ford, 194 Ark. 393, 107 S.W.2d 340 (1937).
         </p>
         <p>
          Court to which a dealer appeals from order revoking his permit has duty to hear the evidence, and if this is not sufficient to show a violation of the law, it should restrain the Commissioner of Revenues (now the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division) from cancelling the permit. Blum v. Ford, 194 Ark. 393, 107 S.W.2d 340 (1937).
         </p>
         <p>
          Although the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board lacked authority to revoke a permit under this section for making false material statements in an application since a permit had never been issued, there was substantial evidence that the applicant failed to meet the conditions attached to the granting of his permit within 12 months.Sheppard v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2014 Ark. App. 604, 447 S.W.3d 614 (2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Competitor's argument was rejected that the transferee of a retail liquor permit made a materially false statement in his application when he indicated that he owned the property where the liquor store would be operated; the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board deemed his explanation for renting the property rather than owning it credible.Gildehaus v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2016 Ark. 414, 503 S.W.3d 789 (2016).
         </p>
         <p>
          In a case where an application for a retail liquor store was conditionally granted, an appellate court did not consider whether the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board had the authority to revoke a permit and whether it complied with revocation procedures because no permit had ever been granted.Sheppard v. Ark. ABC Bd., 2014 Ark. App. 604, 447 S.W.3d 614 (2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Although a permit may be revoked for a transfer or assignment thereof, a contract for the sale of a liquor store to nonresident purchasers was not illegal where purchasers knew at the time of the purchase that as nonresidents a liquor permit could not be transferred or issued to them. Smith v. Ferguson, 302 Ark. 388, 790 S.W.2d 162 (1990).
         </p>
         <p>
          If the Commissioner of Revenues (now the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division) knows or discovers by investigation that law is being violated by person having a permit, he has not only the authority but the duty to revoke or cancel the permit. Blum v. Ford, 194 Ark. 393, 107 S.W.2d 340 (1937).
         </p>
         <p>
          The Commissioner of Revenues (now the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division) had power to cancel retail liquor license for violations of statutes where permittee sold liquor for consumption in the state upon which the export tax but not the retail tax had been paid, without the necessity of a conviction through prosecution in the courts. Whitmore v. McCarroll, 198 Ark. 211, 128 S.W.2d 244 (1939).

       3-4-407. Violation of local closing hours laws.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly, by legislation, and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division, by rule, have created general closing hours for establishments which sell or dispense alcoholic beverages. However, the General Assembly and the division have also given the power to local city governments or local county quorum courts to adopt hours of operation which are more restrictive than the general hours of operation stated for certain permits issued by the division. It is recognized that it is more convenient for local authorities to change local ordinances on a basis that can be more frequent than the basis with which the General Assembly meets or the division adopts rules. For that reason, local control of these issues, as allowed by Code sections and regulations, is desirable. It is also recognized that when a city or county adopts a more restrictive law in this area it is unnecessary and burdensome for the city or county to notify the division each time that a modification is made to local laws, and for this reason enforcement of more restrictive ordinances should be by local law enforcement personnel who are attached to the jurisdiction which creates the more restrictive hours-of-operations law.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is hereby provided that when any permittee of the division is cited with a violation of any local closing hour ordinance adopted by a city government or a county government, that violation of an ordinance which is more restrictive than provided for by the state shall be punishable by a fine of one hundred dollars ($100) to five hundred dollars ($500) and that violation shall not be considered to be an administrative violation against the permit issued by the division.

        Effective Dates. Acts 2009, No. 294, § 30: Mar. 3, 2009. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that on-premises consumption outlets in the State of Arkansas are not able to compete on an equal and similar basis with outlets located in states surrounding the State of Arkansas; that the State of Arkansas is in need of additional revenues; that only minor adjustments to the violation fine schedule have been made since its passage in 1981; and that this act is immediately necessary to raise additional revenues and to better address violations committed by Alcoholic Beverage Control Division permit holders. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments. The 2009 amendment, in (c), substituted “one thousand dollars ($1,000)” for “one hundred dollars ($100)” and made a minor stylistic change.

       <p>

It is further determined that these technical corrections are necessary to give full force and effect to the provisions of Act 294 of 2009 and that if this technical corrections bill is not passed with an emergency clause then unnecessary confusion concerning the provisions of Act 294 of 2009 may arise.

     Publisher's Notes. This chapter contains provisions which exclusively regulate the manufacture, sale, and transportation of beer and wine. However, beer and wine are also regulated under provisions of this title governing “alcoholic beverages” generally, with the applicability of such provisions frequently dependent upon the alcoholic content of the beverage or, in the case of wine, its place of manufacture. Consequently, the provisions of this chapter must be read in conjunction with the remainder of the title in order to form a complete picture of the regulatory scheme as it applies to beer and wine. Specific provisions governing excise taxes on beer and wine, local option elections for beer, and on-premises consumption of wines are found in chapters 7-9.

            Effective Dates. Acts 1933 (1st Ex. Sess.), No. 7, § 30: approved Aug. 24, 1933. Emergency clause provided: “It is found as a fact that since the Congress of the United States has authorized the manufacture and sale of light wines and beers as herein defined, they are being sold throughout the state, and if operation of this act is delayed they will be generally sold, possessed, transported, and used, with prevention and proper policing impossible; and it is further found that the tax revenues provided for in this act are immediately needed by the state to prevent deficits in the matters that are the objects of the taxes stated herein; an emergency is therefore declared and it is necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety that this act shall become effective without delay, and this act shall take effect and be in force at once.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Acts 1937, No. 261, § 3: Mar. 17, 1937. Emergency clause provided: “It is found that a great number of the places throughout the State of Arkansas where wines and beer are licensed to be sold and dispensed are being so operated and conducted as to be inimical to the public peace, health, and safety and that this act is consequently necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety; therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act shall be effective immediately upon its adoption and approval.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Acts 1971, No. 585, § 34: approved Apr. 6, 1971. Emergency clause provided: “It has been found and is hereby declared by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that in order to establish an orderly procedure which will insure the monthly and quarterly distribution of funds for the necessary services and operations of the state government, as provided for in this act, it is necessary that the provisions of this act become effective immediately; that under the provisions of this act seriously needed improvements for many of our public institutions are contemplated, and only the provisions of this act will provide such funds which will be adequate to alleviate this situation; and that only the provisions of this act will correct many of our financial difficulties, and which otherwise may deprive the citizens of this state from receiving the benefits for which the operation of state government contemplates. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage.”

            Acts 1983, No. 420, § 3: Mar. 13, 1983. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that permits issued by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division should be renewable annually no later than August 31; and that this act is immediately necessary to so provide.

            Acts 1991, No. 606, § 14: July 1, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined that numerous persons who are resident aliens of the United States desire to operate establishments that dispense alcoholic beverages in the State of Arkansas and that the same are presently prohibited from obtaining a license in their name. It is further found and determined that the requirement of United States citizenship in order to maintain these establishments poses a burden upon commerce and restricts the number of persons who are able to contribute to the overall economy of the State of Arkansas. It is further found and determined that numerous national corporations are hindered in their operations in that they cannot have newly transferred managers or other key employees assume positions of responsibility within their local outlets since those persons do not meet the two (2) year residency requirement and that such requirement poses an unreasonable burden on the conduct of business in this state as it relates to alcohol beverage outlets. It is further found that the present process of applying for or renewing ABC licenses by requiring proof of payment of personal property taxes is cumbersome, unnecessary, and has no direct relationship to the operation of the ABC permitted outlet. It is further found and determined that there are presently numerous conflicting requirements which are applied to applicants for various retail licenses issued by the state ABC Division and that it is necessary and proper that such permit requirements be made uniform. That all of the aforementioned encumbrances are a burden on the transaction of commerce in the state and upon the efficient administration of government in the state. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1, 1991.”

            Acts 2009, No. 294, § 30: Mar. 3, 2009. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that on-premises consumption outlets in the State of Arkansas are not able to compete on an equal and similar basis with outlets located in states surrounding the State of Arkansas; that the State of Arkansas is in need of additional revenues; that only minor adjustments to the violation fine schedule have been made since its passage in 1981; and that this act is immediately necessary to raise additional revenues and to better address violations committed by Alcoholic Beverage Control Division permit holders. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

            Acts 2009, Nos. 605 and 606, § 27: Mar. 25, 2009. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the people of the State of Arkansas overwhelmingly approved the establishment of lotteries at the 2008 General Election; that lotteries will provide funding for scholarships to the citizens of this state; that the failure to immediately implement this act will cause a reduction in lottery proceeds that will harm the educational and economic success of potential students eligible to receive scholarships under the act; and that the state lotteries should be implemented as soon as possible to effectuate the will of the citizens of this state and implement lottery-funded scholarships as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

           <p>
            Acts 2015, No. 857, § 12: Mar. 31, 2015. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act is essential to the public interest and operation of the alcohol laws in the State of Arkansas; that this act eliminates conflicting language and allows consistent application of alcohol laws; that this act is immediately necessary due to the substantial growth and continued expansion of the brewing industry in Arkansas; that clear and consistent application of the law to the brewing industry is in the public’s immediate interest as is controlling the distribution of alcoholic beverages within the state. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

        Publisher's Notes. The printed Acts of 1933 (1st Ex. Sess.) contained an erroneous definition of the term “light wine” which merely duplicated the definition of beer. The definition of “light wine” in this section is that which appears in the enrolled act.

It is also the intent of this law that persons no longer be required to be registered voters in the county in which the permit is located and it is further intended that a person must either reside in the county where the premises is located or live within twenty-five (25) miles of the address of the permitted outlet. It is also the intent of this legislation that proof of payment of personal property taxes to the individual counties will no longer be required in order for a person to apply for or renew an ABC license. It is the further intent of this law that various application requirements regarding convicted felon status, status as it relates to violation of liquor laws of this state or any other state and revocation of permits shall be made uniform among various permits issued by the ABC Division. Therefore, any laws that may conflict with this act shall be and the same hereby are repealed.”

          Effective Dates. Acts 1943, No. 244, § 10: approved Mar. 18, 1943. Emergency clause provided: “Whereas the laws of the State of Arkansas regulating the conduct of businesses engaged in the sale of beer at retail are inadequate and it being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety that the sale of beer at retail be regulated by the law enforcement officers of this state, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this bill shall be in full force and effect immediately from and after its passage.”

          Acts 1991, No. 606, § 14: July 1, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined that numerous persons who are resident aliens of the United States desire to operate establishments that dispense alcoholic beverages in the State of Arkansas and that the same are presently prohibited from obtaining a license in their name. It is further found and determined that the requirement of United States citizenship in order to maintain these establishments poses a burden upon commerce and restricts the number of persons who are able to contribute to the overall economy of the State of Arkansas. It is further found and determined that numerous national corporations are hindered in their operations in that they cannot have newly transferred managers or other key employees assume positions of responsibility within their local outlets since those persons do not meet the two (2) year residency requirement and that such requirement poses an unreasonable burden on the conduct of business in this state as it relates to alcohol beverage outlets. It is further found that the present process of applying for or renewing ABC licenses by requiring proof of payment of personal property taxes is cumbersome, unnecessary, and has no direct relationship to the operation of the ABC permitted outlet. It is further found and determined that there are presently numerous conflicting requirements which are applied to applicants for various retail licenses issued by the state ABC Division and that it is necessary and proper that such permit requirements be made uniform. That all of the aforementioned encumbrances are a burden on the transaction of commerce in the state and upon the efficient administration of government in the state. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1, 1991.”

          Acts 2009, Nos. 605 and 606, § 27: Mar. 25, 2009. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the people of the State of Arkansas overwhelmingly approved the establishment of lotteries at the 2008 General Election; that lotteries will provide funding for scholarships to the citizens of this state; that the failure to immediately implement this act will cause a reduction in lottery proceeds that will harm the educational and economic success of potential students eligible to receive scholarships under the act; and that the state lotteries should be implemented as soon as possible to effectuate the will of the citizens of this state and implement lottery-funded scholarships as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

It is also the intent of this legislation that proof of payment of personal property taxes to the individual counties will no longer be required in order for a person to apply for or renew an ABC license. It is the further intent of this law that various application requirements regarding convicted felon status, status as it relates to violation of liquor laws of this state or any other state and revocation of permits shall be made uniform among various permits issued by the ABC Division.

        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1a1">
         The General Assembly finds and determines that, due to extremely high prices of cane sugar and in view of the difficulty Arkansas wineries experience in obtaining dependable supplies of liquid corn sugar used as fermentation sugars in the production of native wines in this state and in view of the fact that many fruits such as apples, berries, peaches, and American varieties of grapes such as Concord and Niagara, which are easily produced in Arkansas, are low in sufficient sugar content in many growing seasons to produce sound, stable wine and because of resulting extremely low alcohol content, the addition of sugar is essential to production of quality-consistent, stable wines.
        </li>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1a2">
         It is essential that the rules pertaining to the production of native wines in this state be modified to permit Arkansas wineries to use various other sources of sugar that have been approved for wine production under applicable federal regulations.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1b">
       <ol>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1b1">
         It is further determined by the General Assembly that in view of federal laws prohibiting the use of artifical flavoring in the production of natural wines it is essential for wineries to use natural fruit flavors and essences, that there is a lack of natural fruit flavor and natural essence produced in Arkansas due to the climatic conditions of this state, for example, vermouth herbs, etc., commonly imported from Europe, and that the lack of natural fruit flavor and natural essence and herbs is causing a severe drop in the sale of Arkansas native wines.
        </li>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1b2">
         More and newer flavors of grape and apple wines are being produced, largely by wineries in the major wine-producing states and foreign countries, making it extremely difficult for Arkansas wineries to increase the exportation of native wine produced in this state into other states.
        </li>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1b3">
         It is in the interest of the fruit and vegetable growers in this state that Arkansas wineries be able to obtain the necessary natural fruit flavors and essences required to flavor and supplement Arkansas native wines produced in this state, thereby permitting Arkansas wineries to offer to the public a broader variety of native wines and, through increased wine production, experience an increasing demand for production of fruits and vegetables in this state which are used in the production of native wines, thereby resulting in gains in employment for the citizens of this state.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>

       <ol>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1c1">
         The General Assembly further determines that it was the purpose and intent of the Native Wine Law to promote the increased marketing and exportation of Arkansas fruits and vegetables in the form of wine and that it was not the intent of the Native Wine Law to curtail the expansion of Arkansas wineries by restricting the supply of raw materials when the supply of any particular raw material within the State of Arkansas is insufficient to sustain a properly aging quality-controlled wine product line.
        </li>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1c2">
         The General Assembly recognizes that acts of God — storms, hail, early spring frost, root bore disease, or other natural factors — or inadequate acreage of fruit needed to sustain the product line may cause an insufficiency in the supply of particular raw materials essential in the production of wine.
        </li>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1c3">
         The General Assembly further recognizes that many farmers in this state tend to overplant more frostproof varieties of grapes which produce heavy tonnages of grapes that, when converted into wine, result in overproduction of a particular type of wine, which is difficult to sell unless blended with other types of wines to make the same easily marketable.
        </li>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1c4">
         These factors and adverse circumstances, coupled with skyrocketing production costs and substantial increases in sugar prices, are causing a decline in the sale of Arkansas wines which may force wineries out of business, with a resulting loss of an established market for the sale of Arkansas grapes and other fruits and vegetables which are produced for sale to wineries.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1d">
       <ol>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1d1">
         The General Assembly is aware of the laws of other states having native wine laws which have adopted the federal laws and regulations as pertaining to the appellation of origin and the blending and proper labeling of wines, which allow a wine to carry the name of the state in which produced on its label as long as seventy-five percent (75%) of the fruit or materials from which the wine is made is grown within the state designated on the label.
        </li>
        <li id="t03c05s3-5-601ol1d2">
         Wineries in other states are thereby enjoying greater flexibility in overcoming weather damage which enables them to market and produce nationally with greater ease. The enactment of comparable provisions is essential to assure that Arkansas wineries and fruit and vegetable growers who sell and produce fruits and vegetables to be used in making wine have a fair competitive position with wineries of other states.

In connection therewith, the secretary shall make independent studies and obtain information as he or she may deem appropriate or necessary to reach a proper decision in regard to the petition.
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)Upon conclusion of the studies, and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the date of the receipt of the petition, the secretary shall issue a ruling.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the secretary shall determine that circumstances justify the invoking of a native wine industry disaster relief program, as authorized in this subchapter, he or she shall state in his or her order the facts which justify the establishment of the program, the anticipated loss in production of Arkansas-grown grapes, fruits, berries, or vegetables, or varieties thereof, to result from the natural disaster, and the duration for which the native wine industry disaster relief program shall extend.
   </p>
   <p>
    Copies of the order shall be filed by the secretary with each licensed native winery in this state and with other interested parties who may request copies of the order.
   </p>
   <p>
    During the period of the native wine industry disaster relief program, as determined by the secretary, native wineries in this state may acquire from sources outside this state supplies of grapes, fruits, berries, or vegetables within the percentage of their total consumption of such products as set forth by the secretary.

   <ol class="alpha">
    <li id="t03c05s3-5-1001ol1a">
     The General Assembly finds and recognizes that the tax incentives of the Native Wine Law of this state have provided incentives to encourage the expansion of the grape wine and other fruit wine industry in Arkansas, have caused the increase in the planting of grapes, berries, and other fruits, and have stimulated the construction, expansion, and operation of native wineries, with resulting benefits of employment, not only in the grape and berry production industry and in the wineries, but also in related industries which furnish cartons, bottles, petroleum products, fertilizer products, farm machinery and equipment, barrels, and related supplies and materials necessary and incidental to the wine industry.
    </li>
    <li id="t03c05s3-5-1001ol1b">
     The stimulation of business activity in this state by the Native Wine Law, with resulting employment, is determined by the General Assembly to be essential to the economic welfare of this state.
    </li>
    <li id="t03c05s3-5-1001ol1c">
     The General Assembly further notes that a number of states have enacted legislation similar to the Native Wine Law or other means of promoting the growth of fruits and vegetables used in the wine industry and that these laws in other states, as in Arkansas, have been enacted under guarantees of the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution that granted to states complete control over alcoholic beverages within and shipped into, their boundaries.
    </li>
    <li id="t03c05s3-5-1001ol1d">
     <ol>
      <li id="t03c05s3-5-1001ol1d1">
       The General Assembly is further aware of proposed legislation presented in recent sessions of the United States Congress which, if passed, would not only destroy the tax incentive plans such as the Native Wine Law, but will also directly and proportionately destroy those growers of wine grapes, fruits, and berries, and wineries within such states who acted in reliance and good faith upon the benefits of the tax incentive plan to make the initial investments to enter into the wine production business.
      </li>
      <li id="t03c05s3-5-1001ol1d2">
       The enactment of federal legislation prohibiting the continuation of tax incentive plans, such as the Native Wine Law, could not only be disastrous to the fruit and berry growers of this state and to the wineries which have invested funds in plants and equipment, but could also contribute to unemployment not only in these industries, but would substantially reduce the demands for goods and services which support the native fruit and berry production industry and the native winery industry, thereby creating a statewide economic decline.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="t03c05s3-5-1001ol1e">
     The General Assembly therefore determines that the enactment of this subchapter is essential to establish a special fruit wine industry-subsidy plan, to be implemented in the event federal legislation is enacted obviating the Native Wine Law, thereby protecting fruit and berry growers from economic collapse and further promoting the high level of employment in this state.

   <p>
    In the event of the passage of federal legislation obviating the Native Wine Law and as a means of providing continued inducement for the production of grapes, berries, fruits, and vegetables used in the production of wine in this state, a program of direct subsidies is established for the benefit of Arkansas growers of grapes, berries, fruits, and vegetables used in the production of wine in this state, which will become effective on the date which the federal legislation obviating the native wine tax becomes effective.

    Acts 1995, No. 537, § 16: July 1, 1995. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that present law does not adequately protect the people of the State of Arkansas from unscrupulous activities of nonresident manufacturers, suppliers, brewers and importers of beer; that the present law does not contain procedures for registration of nonresident manufacturers, suppliers, brewers and importers of beer, nor enforcement of current laws against such groups; and that the present law does not empower the Alcoholic Beverage Division to effectively monitor the activities of manufacturers, suppliers, brewers and importers of beer. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1995.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Acts 1999, No. 96, § 11: Feb. 16, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that economic development and the creation of additional jobs for citizens of Arkansas preserves the public peace, health and safety of the State; that the establishment of wholesaler support centers in the State will create additional jobs that would go to other states that are competing for the establishment of such centers, thereby creating the need for our state's business entities to be able to compete for such centers immediately. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

   <p>
    Acts 2009, No. 294, § 30: Mar. 3, 2009. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that on-premises consumption outlets in the State of Arkansas are not able to compete on an equal and similar basis with outlets located in states surrounding the State of Arkansas; that the State of Arkansas is in need of additional revenues; that only minor adjustments to the violation fine schedule have been made since its passage in 1981; and that this act is immediately necessary to raise additional revenues and to better address violations committed by Alcoholic Beverage Control Division permit holders. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

   <p>
    No holder of a nonresident seller's permit or wholesaler support center permit may solicit, accept, or fill an order for beer or malt from a holder of any type of wholesaler's permit unless the nonresident seller or wholesaler support center permittee is the primary American source of supply for the brand of beer or malt which is ordered.

    The bottler; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The exclusive agent of any of those.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

It is further determined that these technical corrections are necessary to give full force and effect to the provisions of Act 294 of 2009 and that if this technical corrections bill is not passed with an emergency clause then unnecessary confusion concerning the provisions of Act 294 of 2009 may arise.

    Effective Dates. Acts 2015, No. 236, § 2: July 1, 2015. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement requires that the tax base for local taxes be identical to state taxes unless otherwise prohibited by law. Current Arkansas law creates a different tax base for state sales tax as compared to local sales tax. If Arkansas is determined to be out of compliance with the agreement, the state could lose approximately ten million dollars annually in state and local sales tax collections from businesses that have voluntarily registered to report and pay tax under the agreement. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2015.”

    Acts 2017, No. 313, § 4: Mar. 1, 2017.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

        Publisher's Notes. This chapter contains provisions which exclusively regulate the manufacture, sale, and transportation of native brandy. However, native brandy is also regulated under provisions of this title governing “alcoholic beverages” generally. Consequently, the provisions of this chapter must be read in conjunction with the remainder of the title in order to form a complete picture of the regulatory scheme as it applies to native brandy.

      Commissioner of Revenues (now the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division) has power to issue regulations pertaining to transportation of liquors through the state, to require that persons appointed by and responsible to him should make inspections and to ignore inspections otherwise made, but regulations must receive a reasonable interpretation and application in order not to impose unnecessary burdens on interstate commerce intended to be regulated.

    The circuit clerk shall immediately enter upon the circuit court judgment docket the name of the delinquent taxpayer, the amount certified as being due, a short name of the tax, and the date of the entry upon the judgment docket.

    The entry shall have the same force and effect as an entry on the judgment docket of a judgment rendered by the circuit court of the county and shall constitute and be evidence of the state's lien upon the title to any interest in any real property of the taxpayer named in the certificate.

   <p>
    The entry of the certificate as a judgment shall constitute, in addition to the force and effect above described, a lien also upon all personal property of the taxpayer named therein from the time of the entry of the certificate.

    The lien shall be in addition to any and all other liens existing in favor of the state to secure the payment of the unpaid tax, penalty, interest, and costs.

      Publisher's Notes. Acts 1979, No. 1056, § 2, provided that § 1 of that act was amendatory to Initiated Act No. 1 of 1942, to the extent of permitting manufacturing facilities used to produce native wines or beer or to distill, blend, or rectify alcoholic beverages to continue to manufacture these products and to sell or serve the products produced at the facility to customers in any restaurant or other eating facility located on the premises in the event that the facility is located in an area which is voted dry in a local option election. However, the section further provided that this permission to continue business extended only to those facilities where the sale or service of the products was engaged in by the manufacturer at the time the initiated petitions calling for the local option election were filed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Publisher's Notes. Initiated Act No. 1 of 1942 established a procedure for initiating and conducting local option elections which was different from that established in Acts 1935, No. 108, Art. 7. Section 6 of the 1942 act specifically provided that the act was cumulative to the liquor laws then in force in the state.

    It shall be lawful for any warehousing and office facility used by an authorized wholesaler of alcoholic beverages or manufacturing facility of a producer of native wines, or the manufacturing facility of a producer of beer, or the facilities of an alcoholic beverage distiller, blender, or rectifier, to continue in operation and to sell or give away, where previously authorized by law, such products in the facilities or existing restaurants appurtenant thereto, and utilized to promote the word-of-mouth advertising of such products, after the political subdivision in which such facility is located votes against the manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages, provided that the facilities were in use or under construction for use prior to the filing of the petitions for local option election.

      Proceeding for calling an election does not partake of the nature of an adversary proceeding such as is involved in an ordinary law suit but merely provides a method to determine the sentiment of the voters on the liquor question. Gocio v. Harkey, 211 Ark. 410, 200 S.W.2d 977 (1947).

     <p>
      Neither certiorari nor prohibition were proper writs to review order of county court calling a local option election, and filing of notice to apply for certiorari and prohibition would not extend time for taking appeal. Van Gundy v. Caudle, 206 Ark. 781, 177 S.W.2d 740 (1944).

      The 10 day appeal period allowed by the statute is not unreasonable nor is it an infringement on due process of law. Covington v. Shackelford, 222 Ark. 374, 259 S.W.2d 676 (1953).
     </p>
     <p>
      An appeal from a county court order for a local option election is not timely where filed more than 10 days after the judgment becomes final. Covington v. Shackelford, 222 Ark. 374, 259 S.W.2d 676 (1953).
     </p>
     <p>
      The requirement of this section that an appeal be filed within 10 days with regard to the sufficiency of the number of signatures on a petition on a local option issue is not superseded by the 30-day period for an appeal contained in Rule 4(a) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure — Civil. Citizens for a Safer Carroll County v. Epley, 338 Ark. 61, 991 S.W.2d 562 (1999).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Supreme Court of Arkansas had appellate jurisdiction over an appeal of a circuit court order affirming the county clerk's determination that a local-option petition was insufficient to place on the ballot; the 10-day appeal period in subsection (b) of this section only applied when the county clerk had certified a petition and indicated that it would be placed on the ballot, and appellants had timely appealed under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.14.html#t14c14s14-14-915" target="_blank">14-14-915</a></cite>.Keep Our Dollars in Independence Cnty. v.

     </p>
     <p>
      Where county judge and relatives within fourth degree of consanguinity sign petition for local option, remonstrators waive disqualification of the court under the constitutional provisions prohibiting any judge from presiding over a trial in which he is interested, if they proceed to trial without filing a motion for disqualification of the court. Nowlin v. Kreis, 213 Ark. 1027, 214 S.W.2d 221 (1948).
     </p>
     <p>
      Local liquor option elections are in the nature of referendum measures not initiated measures within the meaning of Ark. Const., Amend. 7. Brown v. Davis, 226 Ark. 843, 294 S.W.2d 481 (1956).
     </p>
     <p>
      Suit against county clerk and county board of election commissioners to compel certification of petitions for local option election which were filed more than 90 days before the election to be held in November should prevail since the initiative and referendum amendment to the Arkansas Constitution did not control the time within which petitions must be filed. Armstrong v. Sturch, 235 Ark. 571, 361 S.W.2d 77 (1962). But see Glover v. Russell, 260 Ark. 609, 542 S.W.2d 751 (1976).
     </p>
     <p>
      Written verification by the canvasser is not the only way of establishing the fact of signing. Tollett v. Knod, 210 Ark. 781, 197 S.W.2d 744 (1946).
     </p>
     <p>
      Circuit court clearly erred by refusing to consider 720 signatures in its review of the county clerk's certification of a ballot-question committee's local-option petition; a circuit court is called upon to determine whether the petition is sufficient, meaning whether thirty-eight percent of the registered voters signed the petition, and, in that review, a circuit court has to consider the entire petition, which includes all of the signatures submitted to a county clerk with the petition.Our Cmty., Our Dollars v. Bullock, 2014 Ark. 457, 452 S.W.3d 552 (2014).
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure of signers of a local option election petition for a township to state their voting precinct was not a fatal defect where the township was not so large as to create doubt as to each signer's identity, and since there is no provision requiring signers to state their voting precincts. Taylor v. Spence, 224 Ark. 223, 272 S.W.2d 437 (1954).
     </p>
     <p>
      Procedural deficiencies by the county clerk upon the proper filing of a local liquor option petition are not fatal when there is yet time in which the clerk may correct such deficiencies. Brown v. Davis, 226 Ark. 843, 294 S.W.2d 481 (1956).
     </p>
     <p>
      A local liquor option petition is sufficient if it complies with this section and need not be in the form of an initiated county measure. McCurry v. Wilson, 226 Ark. 860, 294 S.W.2d 485 (1956).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where local option election petition poses an issue on having hard liquor or complete prohibition in a county already committed to modified prohibition allowing sale of beer and light wines, it is not invalid because it offers no opportunity to vote for the current modified prohibition. McCurry v. Wilson, 226 Ark. 860, 294 S.W.2d 485 (1956).
     </p>
     <p>
      Portion of petition setting out that it was “An act to legalize the manufacture, sale, bartering, lending, and giving away of intoxicating liquors within Bradley County, Arkansas,” was invalid due to the fact that there is a general state law which governs the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors and a county may not pass a local law while a general law covering the same subject matter is in effect. Grubbs v. Rowland, 226 Ark. 874, 296 S.W.2d 201 (1956).
     </p>
     <p>
      Variance in language of petition by use of the word “lending” where this section says “loaning” did not affect the legality of the petition. Grubbs v. Rowland, 226 Ark. 874, 296 S.W.2d 201 (1956).

     Sale of beer containing not more than 5% alcohol by weight in territory voting dry under this subchapter is a violation of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c03s3-3-208" target="_self">3-3-208</a></cite>. Joy v. State, 211 Ark. 185, 199 S.W.2d 745 (1947).
     </p>
     <p>
      During pendency of election contest wherein previously dry county had voted wet, the sale of beer was unlawful. Graham v. State, 240 Ark. 307, 399 S.W.2d 272 (1966).
     </p>
     <p>
      Defendant charged with committing third offense under this section is charged with a felony, which is a higher offense than that charged for first and second offense. Robbins v. State, 219 Ark. 376, 242 S.W.2d 640 (1951).
     </p>
     <p>
      Information charging defendant with commission of felony in that he sold liquor for third time in dry territory must charge defendant generally with commission of two prior offenses, and conviction of defendant of a felony for third offense in selling liquor in dry territory was erroneous where information did not do so since defendant was convicted of higher offense than alleged as mere misdemeanor was charged. Robbins v. State, 219 Ark. 376, 242 S.W.2d 640 (1951).
     </p>
     <p>
      A conviction upon a plea of guilty for the felony of the third offense of selling intoxicating liquor in a dry territory not based in the information on a charge of third offense or prior conviction or other allegation to notify the defendant exceeds the court's jurisdiction so that certiorari will lie to quash the judgment. Switzer v. Golden, 224 Ark. 543, 274 S.W.2d 769 (1955).
     </p>
     <p>
      Instructions pertaining to felony provisions of this section were not improperly given. Wimberly v. State, 240 Ark. 345, 399 S.W.2d 274 (1966).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where defendant had two previous convictions for illegal sale of intoxicating liquor, the requirement of statute making subsequent conviction a felony was met and conviction as “second offender” was not required before felony provision applied. Wimberly v. State, 240 Ark. 345, 399 S.W.2d 274 (1966).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Writ of habeas corpus was not the proper remedy where prisoner was convicted under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c03s3-3-205" target="_self">3-3-205</a></cite> for selling liquor in a dry territory covered by this section, since proper remedy was by appeal. Goodman v. Storey, 221 Ark. 308, 254 S.W.2d 63 (1952).
     </p>
     <p>
      Imposition of fine and imprisonment was erroneous where language of indictment indicated offense was for selling liquor in dry territory instead of selling liquor without a license; hence defendant was subject only to a fine. Robbins v. State, 219 Ark. 664, 244 S.W.2d 156 (1951).

    Publisher's Notes. Initiated Act No. 1 of 1942 established a procedure for initiating and conducting local option elections which was different from that established in Acts 1935, No. 108, Art. 7. Section 6 of the 1942 act specifically provided that the act was cumulative to the liquor laws then in force in the state. Additionally, in Denniston v. Riddle, 210 Ark. 1039, 199 S.W.2d 308 (1947), Acts 1935, No. 108, was referred to in the construction of an election held under Initiated Act No. 1 of 1942.

     </p>
     <p>
      “(2)Any sale, barter, or loan of any article with the agreement, expressed or implied, that the right or title to or possession of any such beverage, liquid mixture, or decoction shall also pass, shall be considered a sale, barter, or loan within the terms of this subsection.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(3)Any person who shall sell, barter, or loan, directly or indirectly, any such beverage, liquid mixture, or decoction in any such county, city, town, or precinct, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a violation and fined the sum of not less than twenty dollars ($20.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100) for each offense.

Any person so offending shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c)The possession of a United States special tax stamp commonly called United States license for carrying on the business of a retail dealer in spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or the having of the tax permit issued by the Director of the Department of Finance and Administration or license at the place of business in the territory shall be prima facie evidence of guilt under this section.
     </p>
     <p>

   <p>
    (1)Whenever a local option election shall be held in any county, city, town, district, or precinct in this state and a majority of the votes cast at the election shall be in favor of prohibiting the sale of liquor in the territory in which the election shall have been held, the law prohibiting the sale shall be in full force and effect at the expiration of sixty (60) days from the date of the entry of the certificate of the canvassing board in the record of the county court.

   <p>
    <p>
   Rational-basis test applied to a county resident's constitutional challenge to the local-option framework set forth in this subchapter, as the holding of a liquor license is a privilege, not a fundamental right; further, the rational-basis test is used when a statute falls within the legislature's police powers to regulate an industry of general public interest, and the regulation of alcohol is of general public interest.Brennan v. White Cty., 2019 Ark. App. 146, 573 S.W.3d 577, cert. denied, <cite class="l_ed">205 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 220 (U.S. 2019).

    <p>
   County resident failed to show that the local-option framework set forth in this subchapter was not rationally related to achieving any legitimate governmental objective given the correlation between alcohol misuse and detrimental effects on a person's health.Brennan v. White Cty., 2019 Ark. App. 146, 573 S.W.3d 577, cert. denied, <cite class="l_ed">205 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 220 (U.S. 2019).
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   County resident's challenge to the effectiveness of the local-option framework set forth in this subchapter was rejected, as effectiveness in furthering the government interest is not a factor in determining a statute's constitutionality under the rational-basis test.Brennan v. White Cty., 2019 Ark. App. 146, 573 S.W.3d 577, cert. denied, <cite class="l_ed">205 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 220 (U.S. 2019).

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined that numerous persons who are resident aliens of the United States desire to operate establishments that dispense alcoholic beverages in the State of Arkansas and that the same are presently prohibited from obtaining a license in their name. It is further found and determined that the requirement of United States citizenship in order to maintain these establishments poses a burden upon commerce and restricts the number of persons who are able to contribute to the overall economy of the State of Arkansas. It is further found and determined that numerous national corporations are hindered in their operations in that they cannot have newly transferred managers or other key employees assume positions of responsibility within their local outlets since those persons do not meet the two (2) year residency requirement and that such requirement poses an unreasonable burden on the conduct of business in this state as it relates to alcohol beverage outlets. It is further found that the present process of applying for or renewing ABC licenses by requiring proof of payment of personal property taxes is cumbersome, unnecessary, and has no direct relationship to the operation of the ABC permitted outlet. It is further found and determined that there are presently numerous conflicting requirements which are applied to applicants for various retail licenses issued by the state ABC Division and that it is necessary and proper that such permit requirements be made uniform. That all of the aforementioned encumbrances are a burden on the transaction of commerce in the state and upon the efficient administration of government in the state. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1, 1991.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that although the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday is permitted in some cities of this State, even in those cities the sale of beer and wine is not permitted on Sunday; that it is fundamentally unfair to authorize the Sunday sale of mixed drinks but to prohibit the Sunday sale of beer and wine; that this act would provide equal protection to the purveyors of beer and wine; that to give immediate effect to this act will lessen the possibility of a challenge to the present law allowing the Sunday sale of mixed drinks, and thereby save the taxpayers the cost involved in defending the challenge and the cost of an unsuccessful defense; and that, therefore, this act should go into effect immediately. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

The State of Arkansas is losing businesses to other states due to the restrictions imposed on selling liquor in wet counties.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      A policy declaration that liquor laws should be strictly enforced is not a legislative declaration requiring the application of all existing statutes governing intoxicating liquor permits to the “on-premises consumption” type of permit. The General Assembly's directive that the board, in adopting rules and regulations governing qualifications for permits and otherwise implementing and effectuating the purposes of the acts, be guided by rules and regulations applicable to retail liquor licenses “insofar as pertinent” does not require application of the laws governing liquor permits generally.

      Foreign wines are included within the meaning of “alcoholic beverages” as stated in this section since it is obvious that the term embraces all intoxicating liquors of any sort except beer and native wine.

     The prohibition of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c04s3-4-206" target="_self">3-4-206</a></cite> would not apply to the transfer of a private club permit for dispensation of alcoholic beverages by the drink or in broken or unsealed containers for consumption on the premises.

      Where an applicant was not a non-profit organization with requisite number of dues-paying members which had been in existence for statutory period but had obtained a two year old charter from another county, amended it to change the address, and sold prospective memberships with no definite immediate purpose other than the consumption of alcoholic beverages, the applicant was not eligible to obtain a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in a dry county. Lassiter v. Kesterson, 284 Ark. 498, 683 S.W.2d 613 (1985).
     </p>
     <p>
      Approval of a private-club permit was proper because a club established that it had a nonprofit purpose other than the consumption of alcohol under subdivision (14)(A)(i) of this section where it operated in conjunction with a restaurant and was designed to enhance the dining experience. Moreover, the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Division Board's interpretation of subdivision (14)(A)(i) was entitled to deference, and arguments relating to nonprofit status that were not fully developed before the Board were not preserved for appellate review.Barnes v. Ark. Dep't of Fin. & Admin., 2012 Ark. App. 237, 419 S.W.3d 20 (2012).

     The policy declaration of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t03c09s3-9-201" target="_self">3-9-201</a></cite> that liquor laws should be strictly enforced is not a legislative declaration requiring the application of all existing statutes governing intoxicating liquor permits to the “on-premises consumption” type of permit, and the General Assembly's directive that the board, in adopting rules and regulations governing qualifications for permits and otherwise implementing and effectuating the purposes of the acts, be guided by rules and regulations applicable to retail liquor licenses, “insofar as pertinent,” does not require application of the laws governing liquor permits generally.

     <p>
      A city had the authority to enact an ordinance regulating the sale or consumption of mixed drinks at private clubs during certain hours of the day, since the state had not preempted the subject by statute or regulation, and this section provides that nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the power of local governmental bodies to regulate the operation of private clubs. Tompos v. City of Fayetteville, 280 Ark. 435, 658 S.W.2d 404 (1983).
     </p>
     <p>
      The mere fact that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board had never exercised its regulatory authority under this section by adopting specific operating hours for private clubs did not mean that private clubs had the right to remain open and serve or permit consumption of alcohol 24 hours a day; accordingly, a city ordinance prohibiting private clubs from serving or allowing consumption of mixed drinks between certain hours was enacted for the protection of public health, welfare, safety, and morals, and was not in conflict with the general law of the state.

Hotel, motel, and restaurant permittees may serve alcoholic beverages purchased under their permits only when they have first secured written permission from the permittee of the large meeting or attendance facility.

Such advertising devices shall include items such as inside or outside signs, scoreboards, programs, scorecards, and the like. Provided, if such advertising by the beer wholesaler results in the formation or existence of an exclusive buying arrangement by the large attendance facilities permittee and the wholesaler who furnishes such items, then such an exclusive buying arrangement will be a violation of the large attendance facilities permit and the wholesale beer permit involved even if the arrangements are caused by third parties.

Promotional items shall include items used by the facility to promote attendance.

    However, if the use of sponsorship funds, advertising items, or promotional items by the beer wholesaler results in the formation or existence of an exclusive buying arrangement by the large attendance facilities permittee and the wholesaler who furnishes the sponsorship funds, advertising items, or promotional items, then the exclusive buying arrangement will be a violation of the large attendance facilities permit and the wholesaler's wholesale beer permit even if the arrangements are caused by third parties.

     <p>

      Factors to be considered by the alcoholic beverage control board before issuing a permit to operate a private club include: (1) the number and types of alcoholic permits in the area; (2) economic impact; (3) traffic hazards; (4) remoteness of the area; (5) degree of law enforcement available; (6) input from law enforcement or other public officials in the area; and (7) comments from area residents in opposition or support of the permit.

        There is nothing ambiguous or unclear in the provisions of this subchapter since the intent and purpose as to private clubs clearly is to levy a supplemental tax on the gross proceeds or gross receipts from alcoholic beverages dispensed but not sold by the private clubs to its members and guests in the same percentage amount as is levied on the gross proceeds or gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages through hotels, cafes, and other lawful channels where such sales are lawfully conducted.

        Cities and incorporated towns have the authority to levy a permit fee “and/or” supplemental tax in addition to the fee and tax levied by the state pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. Cox v. City of Caddo Valley, 305 Ark. 155, 806 S.W.2d 6 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substitution of “or” for “and/or” following “permit fee” in subsection (f) of this section upon codification was not authorized by the laws or the Constitution of Arkansas in effect at the time of the omission, change or modification, and thus the “and/or” language of former A.S.A. § 48-1410 is still controlling. Cox v. City of Caddo Valley, 305 Ark. 155, 806 S.W.2d 6 (1991).

        The fact that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board had never exercised its regulatory authority under this section by adopting specific operating hours for private clubs did not mean that private clubs had the right to remain open and serve or permit consumption of alcohol 24 hours a day; accordingly, a city ordinance prohibiting private clubs from serving or allowing consumption of mixed drinks between certain hours was enacted for the protection of public health, welfare, safety, and morals, and was not in conflict with the general law of the state.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the present law relating to selling and serving wine with meals in restaurants is unduly restrictive; that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny persons in smaller cities and other areas an opportunity to have wine service with their meals in restaurants; that this act is designed to alleviate this situation and should be given effect immediately.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the present law relating to selling and serving wine with meals in restaurants is unduly restrictive in that it permits the same only in restaurants located in cities having a population of 15,000 or more; that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny persons in smaller cities located in said counties an opportunity to have wine service with their meals in restaurants while permitting the same in larger cities; that this act is designed to alleviate this situation and should be given effect immediately.

    Acts 1991, No. 606, § 14: July 1, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined that numerous persons who are resident aliens of the United States desire to operate establishments that dispense alcoholic beverages in the State of Arkansas and that the same are presently prohibited from obtaining a license in their name. It is further found and determined that the requirement of United States citizenship in order to maintain these establishments poses a burden upon commerce and restricts the number of persons who are able to contribute to the overall economy of the State of Arkansas. It is further found and determined that numerous national corporations are hindered in their operations in that they cannot have newly transferred managers or other key employees assume positions of responsibility within their local outlets since those persons do not meet the two (2) year residency requirement and that such requirement poses an unreasonable burden on the conduct of business in this state as it relates to alcohol beverage outlets. It is further found that the present process of applying for or renewing ABC licenses by requiring proof of payment of personal property taxes is cumbersome, unnecessary, and has no direct relationship to the operation of the ABC permitted outlet. It is further found and determined that there are presently numerous conflicting requirements which are applied to applicants for various retail licenses issued by the state ABC Division and that it is necessary and proper that such permit requirements be made uniform. That all of the aforementioned encumbrances are a burden on the transaction of commerce in the state and upon the efficient administration of government in the state. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect on and after July 1, 1991.”

    Acts 2009, No. 294, § 30: Mar. 3, 2009.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
