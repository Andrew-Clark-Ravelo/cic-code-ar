       The enactment of the safety code was not intended to alter the existing law with respect to division of duties and responsibilities between prime and subcontractors, and an injury to an employee of a subcontractor working on property under the exclusive control of the subcontractor is not made the responsibility of the prime contractor by this subchapter.

       This section does not intend to punish one who knowingly gives employment to a laborer during the expired term of his contract with another, but the employment must be an interference with the laborer's performance of his prior contract with another or an enticement of the laborer from his employment or an inducement to him to leave his employer's services.

     <p>
      Acts 2017, No. 914, § 5: Apr. 5, 2017. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that a recent 4 to 3 decision by the Supreme Court in Gerber Products Company v. Hewitt, 2016 Ark. 222, 492 S.W.3d 856, is at odds with the intent of the General Assembly because it misinterpreted state law, as evidenced by the legislative history surrounding the Minimum Wage Act of the State of Arkansas, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-201" target="_self">11-4-201</a></cite> et seq., to require compensation for certain activities otherwise made noncompensable through the collective bargaining process; that the dissenting opinion in Gerber Products Company v. Hewitt better reflects the legislative intent of the General Assembly and identifies some of the dangers presented by the majority opinion, specifically that ‘the floodgates will open to litigation at the enormous cost to businesses in Arkansas’ and that the opinion ‘undermines the collective-bargaining process and destroys any confidence employers and employees have in the enforceability of their agreements’; that certain activities have not been considered to be ‘work’ under state or federal law by employers and employees in the State of Arkansas who have conducted business in reliance upon that accepted understanding; that federal law embodied in the Fair Labor Standards Act, <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 201</cite> et seq., along with regulations and case law interpreting the same, has for many decades established that these certain activities are not compensable ‘work’; that the Minimum Wage Act of the State of Arkansas, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-201" target="_self">11-4-201</a></cite> et seq., existed for nearly fifty years without any interpretation that such activities should be compensable ‘work’ under any state law; and that this act is immediately necessary to legislatively overrule Gerber Products Company v. Hewitt, to clarify that the Minimum Wage Act of the State of Arkansas, § 11-4-201 et seq., incorporates and has always relied upon <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 254</cite>, which is now embodied in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-221" target="_self">11-4-221</a></cite>, to define whether certain activities constitute compensable ‘work’ under state law, and to clarify the Minimum Wage Act of the State of Arkansas's deference to collective bargaining as embodied in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-205" target="_self">11-4-205</a></cite>, so as to (1) protect the sanctity of collective bargaining agreements that have been negotiated and honored so as not to require compensation for activities like those described in <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 203(o)</cite> of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and (2) protect Arkansas employers from increased business costs that would place them in a competitive disadvantage by comparison to employers in other states and that would result in irreparable economic harm to such Arkansas employers and their employees. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

       Employees'
   motion for class certification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 was granted where: (1) the corporations currently employed approximately 820 employees at the Batesville facility; (2) the employees showed that the common legal question shared by the members of the proposed class was whether the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act (AMWA), § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-201" target="_self">11-4-201</a></cite> et seq., and/or common law quantum meruit required the corporations to compensate their employees for donning and doffing related activities; (3) the proposed class members shared the same legal theory, which was that the corporations violated the AMWA by failing to pay them for all compensable work time and they all claimed that donning and doffing activities were compensable under AMWA and common law quantum meruit; (4) there was no indication that the class representatives'
   desire to receive additional compensation would be adverse to the class's interests and the class representatives indicated a willingness to prosecute their claims through qualified counsel.

      <p>
       Court granted the employees'
   motion for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 in their action alleging that defendants violated the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.S. § 201 et seq., and the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-201" target="_self">11-4-201</a></cite> et seq., by failing to compensate hourly employees for time spent donning, doffing, sanitizing required gear and equipment, walking to and from the production floor, and other related and required duties because the employees met the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation requirements of R. 23(a), and they demonstrated that common issues predominated and that a class action was the superior method for adjudicating the employees'
   claims as required by R. 23(b)(3).

      </p>
      <p>
       Because the court denied class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 in an earlier filed case on the ground that the named plaintiffs were not typical of or adequate representatives for the class, it was not a reason equally applicable to any later suit, so American Pipe applied and the statute of limitations was tolled by the prior action. Under Arkansas's savings statute, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-126" target="_blank">16-56-126</a></cite>, the tolling gave plaintiffs one year after certification was denied in the prior action to commence a new action and receive the full protection of the prior action, and because plaintiffs filed the instant action within that year, they received the maximum benefit of the tolling, except that they could not recover from any further back than October 1, 2006, because prior to October 1, 2006, the employer was exempt from the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act as it was subject to the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

       In a case alleging violations of the Minimum Wage Act of the State of Arkansas, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c04s11-4-201" target="_self">11-4-201</a></cite> et seq., a circuit court did not abuse its discretion in certifying a class action under the less rigorous analysis of Ark. R. Civ. P. 23. The question of whether an employer's lunch auto-deduct policy was illegal and whether its time reclamation policy was reasonable could have been determined on a class-wide basis and was common for all putative class members. Whether the employer had a reasonable reclamation process for claiming overtime was a question that predominated over individual issues. On the issue of superiority, even though the employer was permitted to defend as it saw fit, the question was really more about how to best manage the case, something that the circuit court had broad discretion to determine.

Under the predominance requirement of Ark. R. Civ. P. 23, there was no one set of operative facts to establish liability to any given class member; if the employee did not work through lunch, and if the employee failed to work more than 40 hours in a given work week, there was no liability.

       Supreme Court of Arkansas concludes that the legislative waiver of sovereign immunity in subsection (e) of this section is repugnant to Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 20. In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court interprets the constitutional provision, “The State of Arkansas shall never be made a defendant in any of her courts”, precisely as it reads. The drafters of the current constitution removed language from the 1868 constitution that provided the General Assembly with statutory authority to waive sovereign immunity and instead used the word “never”. The people of the State of Arkansas approved this change when ratifying the current constitution. The General Assembly does not have the power to override a constitutional provision. To the extent subsection (e) of this section directly contradicts the constitution, it must fail.

       In a class action suit under the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act, the circuit court’s denial of the defendant’s motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds was reversed per the holding in Board of Trustees v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a discharged employee's foreman notified him that his money would be sent to a certain station, and the employee acquiesced, this was equivalent to a request by the employee to have the money sent to the station and sufficient to entitle him to recover the statutory penalty for failure to send the money.

      </p>
      <p>
       In order to collect the penalty, an employee must show either that during the seven days of grace he requested the employer to send the payment to a specified mailing address or that not having made the request he renewed his demand for payment after the expiration of the seven-day period. Rousseau v. Ed White Junior Shoe Co., 222 Ark. 240, 258 S.W.2d 240 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       It matters not that an employer may have the discharged person's address somewhere in his files; in order to comply with this section the discharged person must, during the seven-day grace period, leave a specified mailing address.

      <p>

       This section of the Work Near High Voltage Lines Act (Act) had priority over the exclusive remedy provisions of Worker's Compensation Act. Thus, an employer had to indemnify a utility for attorney's fees it incurred in defending personal injury actions as a result of the employer's failure to comply with the notification provisions of the Act.

       While contributory negligence does not bar a recovery, it does diminish the damages in proportion to the negligence attributable to the person injured. Central Coal & Coke Co. v. Barnes, 149 Ark. 533, 233 S.W. 683 (1921); Southern Anthracite Coal Mining Co. v. Rice, 156 Ark. 94, 245 S.W. 805 (1922); Missouri Pac. Transp. Co. v. Baxter, 189 Ark. 1147, 76 S.W.2d 958 (1934).

       The only defense left to a coal company when sued for personal injuries sustained for lack of props was to show that the props were not requested or, if requested, the failure to furnish them was not the proximate cause of the injury. New Union Coal Co. v. Walker, 182 Ark. 460, 31 S.W.2d 753 (1930).

       The negligence of the master or of a fellow servant in failing to provide a safe place to work where the servant is unaware of the negligence is not assumed by the servant. St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. R. Co. v. Vann, 98 Ark. 145, 135 S.W. 816 (1911) (decision prior to enactment of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c08s11-8-103" target="_self">11-8-103</a></cite>).

       Injured employee was not chargeable with having assumed, as incident to his employment, the risk of being hurt unless he realized the danger and then voluntarily exposed himself to it. Saint Louis, I.M. &amp; S. Ry. v. Brogan, 105 Ark. 533, 151 S.W. 699 (1912) (decision prior to enactment of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c08s11-8-103" target="_self">11-8-103</a></cite>).

       The master was liable for negligence in failing to discover and to suppress the dangerous practice of employees. Henry Wrape Co. v. Barrentine, 138 Ark. 267, 211 S.W. 366 (1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action against a company for injuries caused by a fellow servant's negligence, an instruction that there is no assumed risk as to the negligence of the fellow servant unless the plaintiff realized the danger and then exposed himself to it was erroneous; the correct rule being that the plaintiff assumed the risk of the dangers as were so obvious that he could and should have discovered the same in the exercise of ordinary care. Edgar Lumber Co. v. Denton, 156 Ark. 46, 245 S.W. 177 (1922).

Athletic Mining & Smelting Co., 218 Ark. 379, 237 S.W.2d 26 (1951); Hixson Coal Co. v. Furstenberg, 225 Ark. 568, 284 S.W.2d 120 (1955); Boyd Excelsior Fuel Co. v.

    </p>
    <p>
     Commission took a liberal view of former Workers' Compensation law, so where one inference would support an award, and another inference would defeat it, the construction favorable to the claimant should have been adopted, if factually sound. Stout Constr. Co. v. Wells, 214 Ark. 741, 217 S.W.2d 841 (1949) (decision under prior law).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Supreme Court does not favor any interpretation of the statutes which would encourage employee to quit work for the purpose of drawing compensation when he was actually able to work. Quality Excelsior Coal Co. v. Smith, 233 Ark. 67, 342 S.W.2d 480 (1961).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although there are differences in the general construction of Workers' Compensation laws and employee insurance exclusions, there was little doubt that the essential elements of employment remained the same, which caused them to be relevant to each other. Eagle Star Ins. Co. v. Deal, 474 F.2d 1216 (8th Cir. 1973).
    </p>
    <p>
     In determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies, the Workers' Compensation Commission must draw all legitimate inferences and resolve doubts in favor of the claimant, viewing and construing the evidence in favor of the claimant and the purpose of this chapter to compensate those who, by reasonable construction, are within the terms of this chapter. O.K. Processing, Inc. v. Servold, 265 Ark. 352, 578 S.W.2d 224 (1979).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although this chapter is remedial and should be construed liberally in favor of the worker, this does not mean that the court should either enlarge or restrict plain provisions of the chapter. Curtis v. Ermert Funeral Home & Ins. Co. of N. Am., 4 Ark. App. 274, 630 S.W.2d 57 (1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     It is the duty of the commission to follow a liberal approach and to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the claimant. Southland Corp. v. Magers, 15 Ark. App. 360, 695 S.W.2d 380 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     The provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act are to be construed liberally in favor of the claimant in light of its beneficent and humane purposes, and all doubtful issues must be resolved in favor of the claimant. Ashby v. Arkansas Vinegar Co., 22 Ark. App. 167, 737 S.W.2d 177 (1987), aff'd, 294 Ark. 412, 743 S.W.2d 798 (1988).

    <h4 id="t11c09CaseNotesPurpose.">
     <b>
      Purpose.
     </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Former Workers' Compensation law did not call for general accident insurance, its purpose being to compensate only for losses resulting from the risks to which the fact of engaging in the industry exposes the employee. Birchett v. Tuf-Nut Garment Mfg. Co., 205 Ark. 483, 169 S.W.2d 574 (1943), overruled in part, Southern Cotton Oil Div. v. Childress, 237 Ark. 909, 377 S.W.2d 167 (Ark. 1964) (decision under prior law).
    </p>
    <p>
     The policy behind former Workers' Compensation law was that it is fairer to discharge, as an expense of the industry to be paid by the ultimate consumer, a part of the losses arising from the risks to which those engaged in that industry are exposed by reason of being so engaged, than to let the losses fall entirely upon the employee who gets hurt. Birchett v. Tuf-Nut Garment Mfg. Co., 205 Ark. 483, 169 S.W.2d 574 (1943), overruled in part, Southern Cotton Oil Div. v. Childress, 237 Ark. 909, 377 S.W.2d 167 (Ark. 1964) (decision under prior law).
    </p>
    <p>
     The purpose and effect of former Workers' Compensation law was to substitute, as to employees embraced within its terms, the liability thereby created for all liability of the master arising from the death or injury of his servant. Odom v. Ark. Pipe & Scrap Material Co., 208 Ark. 678, 187 S.W.2d 320 (1945) (decision under prior law).
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the primary reasons for workers' compensation is to spread the loss arising from injury to the employee throughout industry. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Smith, 263 Ark. 849, 568 S.W.2d 11 (1978).
    </p>
    <p>
     The basic purpose of this chapter is to shift the burden of work-related injuries from individual employers and employees to the consuming public by making available to the injured employee a speedy and informal statutory remedy. Kifer v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 777 F.2d 1325 (8th Cir. 1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Workers' compensation insurance has the salutary purpose of protecting employees, employers and the public by providing a means by which injured workers may be compensated during the period of their inability to work caused by the injury so that they may continue to exist and feed their families. The public is protected because, hopefully, this prevents injured workers from becoming wards of the state maintained at the expense of the public. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Crist, 664 F. Supp. 1242 (W.D. Ark. 1987), rev'd, 855 F.2d 1326 (8th Cir. Ark. 1988).

     Workers' Compensation Commission does not have jurisdiction of action for slander, as this chapter does not provide for compensation for damage to character as the result of slander. Braman v. Walthall, 215 Ark. 582, 225 S.W.2d 342 (1949), overruled, United Ins. Co. of Am. v. Murphy, 331 Ark. 364, 961 S.W.2d 752 (Ark. 1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter deals, not with intentional wrongs, but only with accidental injuries. Heskett v. Fisher Laundry & Cleaners Co., 217 Ark. 350, 230 S.W.2d 28 (1950).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where employee alleged that employer intentionally destroyed or negligently lost parts of machine that caused employee's injury, and consequently damaged employee's products liability suit against the supplier of the machine, the Workers' Compensation Act did not apply and the employer was not protected by the exclusivity provision. Wilson v. Beloit Corp., 869 F.2d 1162 (8th Cir. 1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act does not specify what extrastate situations it covers. An employer's liability under the Act, however, is based upon disability or death from an injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and “employment” is defined as every employment carried on in the state. Therefore, the application of the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act is limited by its terms to harms arising out of employments carried on in Arkansas. Patton v. Brown & Root, Inc., 31 Ark. App. 141, 789 S.W.2d 745 (1990).

     The rule of liberal construction is not a substitute for a claimant's burden of establishing an injury by a preponderance of the evidence. Central Maloney, Inc. v. York, 10 Ark. App. 254, 663 S.W.2d 196 (1984).

    <p>
     The act was not intended to extend employer's immunity from damages for an injury suffered by an employee to include an employee's cause of action against a third party. Even though the employer will have a setoff against at least part of the damages established in the third party action because of compensation benefits paid, the employee has a right to seek reimbursement against the third party for losses incurred, especially those in excess of scheduled benefits provided by law. Wilson v. Beloit Corp., 869 F.2d 1162 (8th Cir. 1989).

W.M. Bashlin Co. v. Smith, 277 Ark. 406, 643 S.W.2d 526 (1982), superseded by statute as stated in, Billings v. Aeropres Corp., 522 F. Supp. 2d 1121 (E.D. Ark. 2007).

      Jurisdiction.

    </h4>
    <p>
     The first jurisdictional fact that must be established under this chapter is that the claimant or decedent was in fact and in law an employee of the person against whom the claim is asserted. Eagle Star Ins. Co. v. Deal, 337 F. Supp. 1264 (W.D. Ark. 1972), rev'd, 474 F.2d 1216 (8th Cir. 1973).
    </p>
    <p>
     Federal district court does not have jurisdiction to determine whether a person is entitled to Workers' Compensation benefits under Arkansas law. Eagle Star Ins. Co. v. Deal, 337 F. Supp. 1264 (W.D. Ark. 1972), rev'd, 474 F.2d 1216 (8th Cir. 1973).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Workers' Compensation Commission had jurisdiction of a claim arising from an accident in another state, where the employer was an Arkansas corporation, and where the contract for hire was consummated in Arkansas. Midwest Dredging Co. v. Etzberger, 270 Ark. 936, 606 S.W.2d 619 (1980).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where claimant was injured while working in another state and the only circumstance bearing on jurisdiction was that claimant was an Arkansas resident, and facts connecting the state with the employment per se were entirely lacking, the statutory basis required for the commission's jurisdiction was absent. Patton v. Brown & Root, Inc., 31 Ark. App. 141, 789 S.W.2d 745 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court did not err in holding that it had concurrent jurisdiction to determine the applicability of this chapter. Craig v. Traylor, 323 Ark. 363, 915 S.W.2d 257 (1996). But see VanWagoner v. Beverly Enters., 334 Ark. 12, 970 S.W.2d 810 (Ark. 1998).

In pertinent part, the changes to the Insurance Code needed to assure the stability of funding for the Fraud Investigation Division of the Department must be enacted in the laws of this state well before the new fiscal year beginning July 1, 1999. The changes to authorized appropriations, as well as changes to the disability (health) insurance laws on individuals to conform to the federal laws on group policies with guaranteed renewability require immediate adoption; and unless this emergency clause is adopted, this act might not become effective until after the beginning of the next fiscal year.

       The primary purposes of the workers' compensation laws are to pay timely temporary and permanent disability benefits to all legitimately injured workers who suffer an injury or disease arising out of and in the course of their employment, to pay reasonable and necessary medical expenses resulting therefrom, and then to return the worker to the work force; to improve workplace safety through safety programs; to improve health care delivery through use of managed care concepts; to encourage the return to work of injured workers; to deter and punish frauds of agents, brokers, solicitors, employers, and employees relating to procurement of workers' compensation coverage or the provision or denial of benefits; to curtail the rise in medical costs associated with the provision of workers' compensation benefits; and to emphasize that the workers' compensation system in this state must be returned to a state of economic viability.

       Prior to the 1981 amendment a widow needed only to be either living with or dependent for support upon her husband at the time of his death to be entitled to compensation, while a widower had to both be living with and dependent upon his wife for support at the time of her death and be incapacitated to support himself for compensation, which was an impermissible gender-based discrimination and violated the fourteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 18; however, that portion was severable and the offending words “was incapacitated to support himself” were excised from the section. Swafford v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 2 Ark.

       The statutorily-mandated standard of strict construction cannot be applied to subdivision (5) in such a way as to require that a claimant must offer objective medical evidence to prove not only the existence of an injury, but also to show the circumstances under which the injury was sustained and the precise time of the injury's occurrence; subdivision (5) contains many elements that simply are not susceptible of proof by medical evidence supported by objective findings. Stephens Truck Lines v. Millican, 58 Ark. App. 275, 950 S.W.2d 472 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a causal connection between the primary injury and subsequent complication or disability, an activity of the claimant that triggers the subsequent complications must be “unreasonable under the circumstances,” in order to be an independent intervening cause under (5)(F)(iii) of this section. Davis v. Old Dominion Freight Line Inc., 69 Ark. App. 74, 13 S.W.3d 171 (2000), aff'd, 341 Ark. 751, 20 S.W.3d 326 (2000).

       The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act does not specify what extrastate situations it covers. An employer's liability under the Act, however, is based upon disability or death from an injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and “employment” is defined as every employment carried on in the state. Therefore, the application of the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act is limited by its terms to harms arising out of employments carried on in Arkansas. Patton v. Brown & Root, Inc., 31 Ark. App. 141, 789 S.W.2d 745 (1990).

       Proceedings before the Workers' Compensation Commission and a workers' compensation claim in Oklahoma are not mutually exclusive, but all states having a legitimate interest in an injury have the right to apply their own rules and standards, either separately, simultaneously or successively. Robinson v. Ed Williams Constr. Co., 38 Ark. App. 90, 828 S.W.2d 860 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' Compensation Commission's decision to deny worker permanent partial disability benefits was based on a flawed application of subdivision (4)(F)(ii) of this section; although the commission's opinion properly examined the worker's claim regarding the issue of permanent impairment, its conclusions addressed whether the compensable injury was the major cause of the permanent disability or need for treatment such that the commission had to render a conclusion on whether the worker proved entitlement to the permanent partial impairment rating. Michael v. Keep & Teach, Inc., 87 Ark. App. 48, 185 S.W.3d 158 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation claimant's impairment rating was proper because, in part, pursuant to subdivision (16)(A) of this section, pain, active range-of-motion, and straight-leg-raising tests could not be used for assessment of impairment in workers'
   compensation cases.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in awarding an employee temporary total-disability benefits because there was substantial evidence to support its finding that the employee's herniated disc was an accidental injury arising from his employment where the employee's testimony about what happened was corroborated by his supervisor and the documentary evidence in the record and there was no evidence of a non-work related injury or event that contradicted the employee's claim.

       Acts 1993, No. 796 did not apply to employee who sustained one injury in 1992 and a second injury in August 1993, where the second injury was not a new injury but a recurrence of the first and thus was merely a second period of incapacitation. Atkins Nursing Home v. Gray, 54 Ark. App. 125, 923 S.W.2d 897 (1996).

Substantial evidence showed that the employee had a preexisting degenerative knee condition, particularly in view of his prior knee surgery, degenerative arthritis, and the absence of his medial meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament prior to the more recent surgery, and there was no evidence that the need for knee-replacement surgery and the resulting impairment would not have occurred but for the work-related injury.

       The fact of temporary support by mother did not demonstrate that there was no longer any reasonable expectation of support on the part of the father; the child was not able to act for herself and her necessary expenses would naturally increase as she grew older, with the concurrent possibility that her mother would not be able to maintain the child in her accustomed mode of living.

      <p>
       Dependency of a stepchild is not a question of law, but a fact issue to be determined by the circumstances existing when the compensable injury occurs; it is based on proof of either actual support from the deceased employee, or a showing of a reasonable expectation of support where there is evidence that the stepchild is being actually supported by her natural parent, or where she has a right to expect support from the natural parent even if it is not actually provided.

       Where claimant suffered a compensable injury, received medical treatment, returned to his regular job and continued to work until he became totally disabled, claimant is entitled to the maximum weekly benefit rate in effect at the time the disability occurred, and this rate is based on the wages being earned on the date of the accident.

       Denial of the employee's claim for the compensability of a back injury was appropriate under subdivision (4)(B)(iv) of this section because the presence of marijuana metabolites was evidence of the presence of marijuana and the employee failed to overcome the presumption that his injury was caused by the use of illegal drugs.

       One statute only provides the maximum amount of money an employer must pay as compensation for an employee's work-related death, but the statute is silent on whether a credit for good-faith, but ultimately mistaken, payments may be given; because the widow was not her husband's dependent, the money the employer paid her could not be counted as weekly benefits or compensation, and the payments did not accrue as a credit against the employer's responsibility to the Fund.

       Employee sustained a compensable injury, notwithstanding the contention that he failed to report his injury in a timely fashion and failed to seek medical treatment in a timely fashion, since this contention went to the weight and credibility of the testimony and since the definition of a compensable injury does not require timely reporting or timely treatment.

       Workers' Compensation Commission erred in requiring an employee who claimed to have injured his back at work to prove the exact date on which the injury had occurred; it was sufficient under subdivision (4)(A) that the employee could show that the injury had occurred during a specific four-day period.

       Where, in addition to the loss of use, the permanent partial disability consists also of loss of capacity, because of the injury, to earn wages as defined and set out in subdivision (5); the disability includes, blends with, and is usually greater than the disability occasioned by loss of functional use only. Wilson & Co. v. Christman, 244 Ark. 132, 424 S.W.2d 863 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that the claimant was making as much money at the time of the hearing as he was making prior to his injury did not necessarily mean that he had the “capacity” to earn that much. Abbott v. C. H. Leavell & Co., 244 Ark. 544, 426 S.W.2d 166 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the degree of disability as defined by this section, the mentality of the claimant is material to the wage-loss factor, but congenital mental deficiency does not affect entitlement to compensation because compensation is based on previous earnings and earning capacity and is measured by loss of capacity due to the accident. Rooney v. Charles, 262 Ark. 695, 560 S.W.2d 797 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disability means not merely functional disability but also loss of the use of the body to earn substantial wages. Great Plains Bag Corp. v. Ray, 267 Ark. 943, 593 S.W.2d 51 (Ct. App. 1979).
      </p>

       If claimant is totally incapacitated to earn in the same or any other employment the wages he was receiving at the time of his injury, then he is entitled to receive weekly benefits during the continuance of the total disability.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant injured his knee, the injury did not become compensable until claimant suffered a loss of earnings as a result of a nonwork-related injury; thus claim was timely filed. Shepherd v. Easterling Constr. Co., 7 Ark. App. 192, 646 S.W.2d 37 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person injured on the job may suffer disability because of a physical loss or because of an inability to earn as much as he was earning when he was hurt and a person can be disabled who has lost either or both. Terrell v. Austin Bridge Co., 10 Ark. App. 1, 660 S.W.2d 941 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant was earning higher wages at the time of the hearing than he was at the time of the accident, but claimed he could no longer do the work for which he was trained, whether he had a compensable disability was a question for the commission to determine. Terrell v. Austin Bridge Co., 10 Ark. App. 1, 660 S.W.2d 941 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disability which is compensable is based upon incapacity to earn because of injury; the payment of full wages during a compensable disability does not negate the incapacity to earn but may, in proper circumstances, dispense with the requirement that compensation benefits be paid under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-807" target="_self">11-9-807</a></cite>. Arkansas La. Gas Co. v. Grooms, 10 Ark. App. 92, 661 S.W.2d 433 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant undisputedly filed to come within the odd-lot category, in order to prove her entitlement to total disability benefits, the burden remains on her to show that she was incapacitated, because of her injury, to earn, in the same or any other employment, the wages she was receiving at the time of the injury. Leslie v. Sanyo Mfg. Corp., 13 Ark. App. 59, 679 S.W.2d 222 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person can be disabled if the injury has caused a physical loss or an inability to earn as much as he was earning when he was hurt; an injury must be more than an anatomical disability, but must be a disability in the compensation sense to be a previous disability, requiring apportionment under this chapter. State Treasurer, Second Injury Fund v. Coleman, 16 Ark. App. 188, 699 S.W.2d 401 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission did not err in holding that worker's congenital dyslexia was not “a previous disability or impairment” which gives rise to a claim against the Second Injury Fund under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-525" target="_self">11-9-525</a></cite>, where the worker entered the labor market as an unskilled manual laborer, he was pursuing that employment without diminished earning capacity at the time of his injury, and there was no evidence that the claimant could not have continued in the same or similar employment at the same wage he had always earned had it not been for his injury. Holley Enters. v. Nicholls, 19 Ark. App. 97, 717 S.W.2d 495 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Disability”, in the workers' compensation sense, is not based upon loss of earnings per se, but rather is defined in terms of loss of earning capacity. Second Injury Fund v. Robison, 22 Ark. App. 157, 737 S.W.2d 162 (1987).

       A work-related disabling angina attack, although temporary, is no less a disability. Nashville Livestock Comm'n v. Cox, 302 Ark. 69, 787 S.W.2d 664 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, although plaintiff would try most any job offered to him, suitable work was not available to him due to a combination of his advancing age, his level of education, his limited experience in one area of the job market, and his disability; therefore he fell within the odd-lot category of workers. Lewis v. Camelot Hotel, 35 Ark. App. 212, 816 S.W.2d 632 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purpose of defining disability, “any other employment” means any other employment in lieu of the one in which the employee was injured, not concurrent employment, where an employee is working two jobs when injured, and continues employment in one. Stevens v. Mountain Home Sch. Dist., 41 Ark. App. 201, 850 S.W.2d 335 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the definition of “disability” in subdivision (9) does note include any specific reference to physical impairment, Arkansas case law clearly indicates that both physical and earning impairment are components of “disability.” Golden v.

       Workers'

       Temporary total disability was properly granted in a worker's compensation case due to a disability under subdivision (8) of this section while a claimant remained in his healing period from back surgery and supplemented his income by intermittent work with a family business.

       When the claimant returns to work and earns as much as or more than he did prior to his injury, then the necessary and logical inference, absent any contrary evidence, is that the claimant has not suffered a loss of earning capacity; thus, where there was no evidence that the claimant was not doing his job well, that his wage increases were the result of sympathy, or that his earnings were not commensurate with his earning capacity, the claimant failed to establish any compensable injury to his earning capacity.

       Physician's report diagnosed the workers' compensation claimant with lumbalgia, radiculitis, lumbar subluxation and contained no qualifying words regarding the injury; thus, the physician's report constituted substantial evidence supporting the Workers' Compensation Commission's finding that the claimant sustained a compensable injury under subdivision (4)(D). Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Stotts, 49 S.W.3d 667 (2001), substituted opinion, 74 Ark. App. 428, 58 S.W.3d 853 (2001).

       The determination whether the injured individual is an employee or an independent contractor depends on the facts of each case. Irvan v. Bounds, 205 Ark. 752, 170 S.W.2d 674 (1943); Farrell-Cooper Lumber Co. v. Mason, 216 Ark. 797, 227 S.W.2d 444 (1950) (preceding cases decided under prior law); Hollingsworth & Frazier v.

       Evidence that company could discharge claimant at will; that the company required him to increase the number of his crew from time to time; paid social security and unemployment insurance taxes and liability insurance on claimant and his men; and the manner in which the company made loans and advances to claimant and members of his crew, were all facts which the commission had a right to consider in determining the relationship of claimant as an employee. Farrell-Cooper Lumber Co. v. Mason, 216 Ark. 797, 227 S.W.2d 444 (1950) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of an employer to terminate the work at any time without liability is incompatible with the full control of the work that is usually enjoyed by an independent contractor and is a strong circumstance tending to show the subserviency of the worker. Hollingsworth & Frazier v. Barnett, 226 Ark. 54, 287 S.W.2d 888 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The withholding of income taxes, social security taxes, and unemployment taxes is not conclusive or determinative, but are merely circumstances to be considered in determining whether claimant is an employee or an independent contractor. Smith v. West Lake Quarry & Material Co., 231 Ark. 294, 329 S.W.2d 167 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of control, and not its exercise, is a factor in determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists. Julian Martin, Inc. v. Indiana Refrigeration Lines, 262 Ark. 671, 560 S.W.2d 228 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to make a factual determination of employment status, it may not be enough, in a particular case, to consider only the question of control. Franklin v. Arkansas Kraft, Inc., 5 Ark. App. 264, 635 S.W.2d 286 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the factors which might be considered in determining whether an injured person is an employee or an independent contractor, are: (1) the right to control the means and the method by which the work is done; (2) the right to terminate the employment without liability; (3) the method of payment, whether by time, job, piece or other unit of measurement; (4) the furnishing, or the obligation to furnish, the necessary tools, equipment, and materials; (5) whether the person employed is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (6) the skill required in a particular occupation; (7) whether the employer is in business; (8) whether the work is an integral part of the regular business of the employer; and (9) the length of time for which the person is employed. Franklin v. Arkansas Kraft, Inc., 5 Ark. App. 264, 635 S.W.2d 286 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinarily, whether a person is an employee can be determined by the position that person occupies and his relationship to the alleged employer. However, in those cases where a person occupies more than one position, it becomes necessary to consider the type of work that was actually being done by that person at the time of his injury. Fraternal Order of Eagles v. Kirby, 6 Ark. App. 198, 639 S.W.2d 529 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the determination of whether a worker is an employee, the factor of the right to control includes several items such as the right to determine the manner of completing the work, right to terminate, right to hire or control the hiring of helpers, the method of payment, and the furnishing of, or the obligation to furnish, tools or equipment necessary to perform the work; in determining the nature of the work relative to the alleged employer's business, some factors to be considered include whether the worker is engaged in a separate and distinct occupation or business, whether the work to be performed is an integral part of the employer's regular business, and the duration of the employment. Silvicraft, Inc. v. Lambert, 10 Ark. App. 28, 661 S.W.2d 403 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether an injured person is an employee or an independent contractor for purposes of workers' compensation insurance, there are a number of factors to be considered; the right to terminate the employment without liability; the method of payment, whether by time, job, piece or other unit of measurement; the right to control the means and the method by which the work is done; the furnishing, or the obligation to furnish, the necessary tools, equipment, and materials. Sands v. Stombaugh, 11 Ark. App. 38, 665 S.W.2d 902 (1984).

       County sheriff's department was not liable under subdivision (10)(A) for workers' compensation for a deputy sheriff injured when responding to the department's call; the deputy was the employee of an improvement district, had no express or implied contract for hire with the department, and his compensation came entirely from the district. Sharp County Sheriff's Dep't v. Ozark Acres Improvement Dist., 75 Ark. App. 250, 57 S.W.3d 764 (2001), aff'd, 349 Ark. 20, 75 S.W.3d 690 (2002).

       Evidence supported the commission's finding that the deceased, who died as a result of a work-related injury, was an employee within the meaning of this section, despite the fact that the deceased during the last three years of his life had filed tax returns reflecting that the business was a sole proprietorship.

       The terms “sole proprietor” and “self-employed employer,” as used in the Workers' Compensation Act, are neither synonymous nor interchangeable. Under subdivision (2) of this section, a “sole proprietor” must file written notice with the Workers' Compensation Commission to be included in the definition of an “employee,” while under subsection (b) of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-108" target="_self">11-9-108</a></cite> a “self-employed employer” may agree or contract to exclude himself or herself from coverage.

       Where it was stipulated that the employer was a sole proprietorship, subdivision (2) of this section was applicable, and the claimant, the owner of the sole proprietorship, was required to file written notice to be included within the definition of an “employee” under the Worker's Compensation Act. Gilbert v. Gilbert Timber Co., 19 Ark. App. 93, 717 S.W.2d 220 (1986), aff'd, 292 Ark. 124, 728 S.W.2d 507 (1987).

       Sole proprietor, who wanted to be covered by workers' compensation insurance and obtained a policy for that purpose, did not necessarily have to file an A-18 form in order to be a covered employee; the employee had substantially complied with this section.

        —Going and Coming Rule.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The going and coming rule provides that, since all persons are subject to the same street hazards while traveling, injuries sustained by employees going to and coming from work cannot ordinarily be said to arise out of and in the course of the employment within the meaning of the workers' compensation law. Fisher v. Proksch, 20 Ark. App. 80, 723 S.W.2d 852 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Injury during a trip which serves both a business and a personal purpose is within the course of employment if the trip involves the performance of a service for the employer which would have caused the trip to be taken by someone even if it had not coincided with the personal journey. Such a claimant falls within the “dual purpose” exception to the “going and coming” rule, and therefore his injuries are compensable. Fisher v. Proksch, 20 Ark. App. 80, 723 S.W.2d 852 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic premise of the going and coming rule is that employees having fixed hours and places of work are generally not considered to be in the course of their employment while traveling to and from work. Howard v. Arkansas Power & Light Co., 20 Ark. App. 98, 724 S.W.2d 193 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employees whose work entails travel away from the employer's premises are within the course of their employment continuously during the trip, except when a distinct departure on a personal errand is shown. Howard v. Arkansas Power & Light Co., 20 Ark. App. 98, 724 S.W.2d 193 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exception to the going and coming rule permitting recovery for injuries received by employees traveling between two parts of an employer's premises, such as by way of a public street, was applicable where, prior to July 1, 1993 (the effective date of the amendment to subdivision (5)(B)(iii)), employee was struck by a car after parking in employer's parking lot. Wentworth v. Sparks Regional Medical Ctr., 49 Ark. App. 10, 894 S.W.2d 956 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the going and coming rule ordinarily precludes recovery for an injury sustained while the employee is going to or returning from his place of employment, where the journey is part of the service and/or where the employee furnishes his own conveyance, the employee's travel is usually determined to be within the course of employment. Olsten Kimberly Quality Care v. Pettey, 328 Ark. 381, 944 S.W.2d 524 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's injury arose within the course of employment and thus was compensable where her vehicle overturned when she was traveling to her job of providing in-home care. Olsten Kimberly Quality Care v. Pettey, 328 Ark. 381, 944 S.W.2d 524 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' compensation benefits were denied as employee failed to prove the compensability of his claim because an exception to the “going and coming rule” did not apply simply based on the use of a company vehicle and the fact that the employee was on call the night before; moreover, the premises exception was no longer good law. Farler v. City of Cabot, 95 Ark. App. 121, 234 S.W.3d 352 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent that the “going and coming rule” prevents recovery for injuries sustained while the employee was furthering the interests of the employer, it is overruled by the Arkansas Supreme Court. Moncus v. Billingsley Logging, 366 Ark. 383, 235 S.W.3d 877 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee who was following his employer's vehicle so he could locate the jobsite was carrying out the express directions of his employer at the time of his fatal auto accident, even though he was not then engaged in the activity for which he was primarily employed; thus; his death was compensable.

Campbell v. Randal Tyler Ford Mercury, Inc., 70 Ark. App. 35, 13 S.W.3d 916 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is patently improper to summarily pronounce that all claims involving “personal comfort” or “personal convenience” accidents are outside the course of employment and, therefore, are non-compensable without regard for the underlying facts; by the same logic, it is improper to hold that all personal-comfort or personal-convenience accidents are within the course of employment and are compensable, no matter what the facts in individual cases may be; it should be common knowledge that determining the relevant factors for finding the facts in disputed cases under subdivision (4)(B)(iii), is a singularly judicial function rather than legislation. Matlock v. Ark. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 74 Ark. App. 322, 49 S.W.3d 126 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The “employment services” requirement of subdivision (4)(B)(iii), simply reflects the broader requirement that an accident must occur in the course of employment to be compensable; although it is true that “personal comfort” or “personal convenience” cases raise the “employment services” question, workers are entitled to compensation benefits based on injuries from accidents that occurred when they are not performing actual job tasks, and even when the accident occurred away from the employer's premises; the fact that a worker is injured while attempting to satisfy a personal need is not, per se, dispositive regarding whether she was performing employment services when the accident occurred; similarly, the fact that a worker is not directly compensated for the activity engaged in when an accident occurs for which workers' compensation benefits are sought is not controlling as to whether the worker was performing employment services; on the other hand, merely walking to and from one's car, even on the employer's premises, does not automatically constitute performing employment services. Matlock v. Ark. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 74 Ark. App. 322, 49 S.W.3d 126 (2001).

      <p>

      <p>
       Where employee was performing an incidental activity, inherently necessary for the performance of her job, an injury that occurred was compensable and did not provide a basis to circumvent the exclusive remedy provisions of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-105" target="_self">11-9-105</a></cite> so that she could file a civil action against her employer.

      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's injury, suffered from a fall near a time clock, was compensable because the employee was performing employment services at the time of the accident; the evidence showed that the employer required the employee to show an identification badge at two stations, walk down a hallway, and punch a time clock, and it was not determinative that the employee was not paid for performing such duties.

      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that claimant was coming off a break when his injury occurred did not determine compensability, but rather, because claimant was crossing a board which was placed over a ditch for that purpose, in order to return to work, the claimant's action in crossing the board was an activity that directly advanced his employer's interests and constituted employment services; because claimant was performing employment services at the time of his injury, an award of benefits was required under subdivision (4)(A)(i) of this section. Wallace v. West Fraser South, Inc., 90 Ark. App. 38, 203 S.W.3d 646 (2005), aff'd, 365 Ark. 68, 225 S.W.3d 361 (2006).

       Employee's injury was compensable where, with the agency's knowledge and implicit consent, she was clearly performing a service for her own agency client that she was specifically contracted to perform and did so during her agency-scheduled hours; it was manifestly unjust to deny employee benefits where she was injured performing a service for which she could lose her job had she not performed these same services.

   father had not asked her to stop and purchase groceries; and she was not grocery shopping or doing anything related to her job as a personal-care aide at the time of her injury as she was merely traveling to work.

Moreover, the claimant was not considered a residential employee since the injury did not occur in his truck and was not related to sleeping in his truck.

       Fair-minded persons could not reach the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's conclusion to deny benefits to a worker who claimed injuries to his back and right leg resulting from a work-related accident because: (1) the worker's testimony, corroborated by his supervisor, was that he did not suffer from back or right leg problems prior to the accident; (2) the commission's finding that there was no “documented report” of the worker's back complaints until six months after the work incident was unsupported; and (3) the absence of testimony from representatives of the employer's workers'
   compensation carrier, who were within the employer's control, raised the presumption that their testimony would have been unfavorable to the employer.

      </p>
      <p>
       Record did contain objective medical findings sufficient to establish compensability, and the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that the employee proved compensability or in relying on the physician's impairment rating; giving the physician's testimony its maximum effect, as the substantial-evidence standard required the appellate court to do, this would place the employee at the end of his healing period no later than July 28, 2007.

      <p>
       Employee was properly awarded workers'
   compensation benefits under subdivision (4)(D) of this section because the employee had proven a compensable injury to the employee's left elbow and was entitled to all reasonably necessary medical treatment related to the injury; the employee's physician stated that the injury was greater than 51 percent caused by the initial injury at work and failed conservative treatment necessitating surgical repair.

      <p>
       The court's finding that an employee's healing period had not ended was improper, where it was based at least in part, upon a response by a rehabilitation agency to the court's personal inquiry whether that agency could undertake a therapeutic work program for the employee. Bibler Bros. v. Ingram, 266 Ark. 969, 587 S.W.2d 841 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary total disability and the healing period in workers' compensation cases are not the same time periods in all cases; temporary total disability is that period within the healing period in which the employee suffers a total incapacity to earn wages under subdivision (5) and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-519" target="_self">11-9-519</a></cite>. Arkansas State Highway &amp; Transp. Dep't v. Breshears, 272 Ark. 244, 613 S.W.2d 392 (Ark. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The determination of when the healing period has ended is a factual determination that is to be made by the commission; if that determination is supported by substantial evidence, it must be affirmed on appeal. Mad Butcher, Inc. v. Parker, 4 Ark. App. 124, 628 S.W.2d 582 (1982), superseded by statute as stated in, Wright Contracting Co. v. Randall, 12 Ark. App. 358, 676 S.W.2d 750 (1984); Harvest Foods v. Washam, 52 Ark. App. 72, 914 S.W.2d 776 (1996) (decided under prior law) CDI Contractors v. McHale, 41 Ark. App. 57, 848 S.W.2d 941 (1993); Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The healing period continues until the employee is as far restored as the permanent character of his injury will permit, and if the underlying condition causing the disability has become stable and nothing further in the way of treatment will improve that condition, the healing period has ended; the persistence of pain may not of itself prevent a finding that the healing period is over, provided that the underlying condition has stabilized. Mad Butcher, Inc. v. Parker, 4 Ark. App. 124, 628 S.W.2d 582 (1982), superseded by statute as stated in, Wright Contracting Co. v. Randall, 12 Ark. App. 358, 676 S.W.2d 750 (1984) (decided under prior law) Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993).

       Since injured claimant's healing period had ended, claimant could not be entitled to additional temporary total disability benefits. Mad Butcher, Inc. v. Parker, 4 Ark. App. 124, 628 S.W.2d 582 (1982), superseded by statute as stated in, Wright Contracting Co. v. Randall, 12 Ark. App. 358, 676 S.W.2d 750 (1984) (decided under prior law) Elk Roofing Co. v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation law does not authorize award of current total or limited total disability benefits after the end of the healing period. The concept of current total disability benefits seems to have been based on McNeely v. Clem Mill & Gin Co., 241 Ark. 498, 409 S.W.2d 502 (1966); to the extent that McNeely has been interpreted as holding that temporary benefits regardless of how they are denominated may be paid after the end of the healing period that interpretation is erroneous. Arkansas Secretary of State v. Guffey, 291 Ark. 624, 727 S.W.2d 826 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recurring symptoms may give rise to a subsequent healing period, after the original one has ended. Where a second complication is found to be a natural and probable result of the first injury, the employer remains liable, and this liability includes liability for additional temporary benefits when the employee undergoes a second, distinct healing period. Elk Roofing Co. v. Pinson, 22 Ark. App. 191, 737 S.W.2d 661 (1987).

      <p>
       A healing period has not ended so long as treatment is administered for the healing and alleviation of a condition. Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993); Milligan v. West Tree Serv., 57 Ark. App. 14, 946 S.W.2d 697 (1997).

       Employee's healing period ended a year and a half after he failed to lose the amount of weight necessary to allow treatment of his underlying injury. Shepherd v. Van Ohlen Trucking, 49 Ark. App. 36, 895 S.W.2d 945 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The healing period continues until the employee is as far restored as the permanent character of his injury will permit, and if the underlying condition causing the disability has become stable and if nothing in the way of treatment will improve that condition, the healing period has ended. Harvest Foods v. Washam, 52 Ark. App. 72, 914 S.W.2d 776 (1996).

       Substantial evidence supported commission's conclusion that the employee had not reached the end of his healing period. Harvest Foods v. Washam, 52 Ark. App. 72, 914 S.W.2d 776 (1996).

       Evidence did not support the commission's finding that the healing period for the claimant's injured wrist had ended. Milligan v. West Tree Serv., 57 Ark. App. 14, 946 S.W.2d 697 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The healing period in which a claimant suffers a complete inability to earn wages includes the time until the employee is as far restored as the permanent character of the injury will permit; once the underlying condition is more stable and will not improve with further treatment, the healing period is over. Dallas County Hosp. v. Daniels, 74 Ark. App. 177, 47 S.W.3d 283 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a claimant's healing period has ended is a factual question that is resolved by the workers' compensation commission. Dallas County Hosp. v. Daniels, 74 Ark. App. 177, 47 S.W.3d 283 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee was still within her healing period and entitled to an award of temporary total disability benefits where only one of several doctors determined that she had reached maximum medical improvement; other doctors had diagnosed her with spinal stenosis, an acute, severe back pain secondary to a partially ruptured disc, herniation, and disc degeneration with posterior annular tears, and had noted that employee was unable to work since the time of injury, although several attempts had been made for her to return to work. Dallas County Hosp. v. Daniels, 74 Ark. App. 177, 47 S.W.3d 283 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary total disability benefits were properly awarded to employee who fell off a ladder and landed on a concrete floor where she presented substantial evidence that she was temporarily totally disabled and in a healing period, as defined by subdivision (12) of this section, from the time of injury until the day she was released to return to work. Fred's, Inc. v. Jefferson, 361 Ark. 258, 206 S.W.3d 238 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission's decision that employee was not entitled to temporary-total-disability compensation was reversed as none of the doctors who testified at the hearing agreed that employee had reached the end of his healing period. Clairday v. The Lilly Co., 95 Ark. App. 94, 234 S.W.3d 347 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding against the employee in his workers'
   compensation action was appropriate under subdivision (12) of this section and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-526" target="_self">11-9-526</a></cite> because there was substantial evidence to support the finding that the employee failed to avail himself of the opportunity to work and that he was not entitled to temporary disability after May 8, 2008. A release to work stated that the employee be provided jobs within his sedentary restrictions and both the employee and his manager testified that he left that work with various complaints of inability to perform.

      <p>
       Employee's misconduct, which resulted in termination, did not amount to a refusal of suitable employment for the purpose of receiving TTD benefits from April 28, 2008 through August 6, 2008; the employee proved that the employee was still in the healing period under subdivision (12) of this section and was totally incapacitated from earning wages.

      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that an employee proved entitlement to additional medical and TTD benefits under subdivision (12) of this section for a lower back injury that was sustained while working as a concrete finisher; the medical evidence and the employee's testimony demonstrated that the employee remained within the healing period since the date of the injury.
   Webb v. Webb, 2012 Ark. App. 207 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err under subdivision (12) of this section in failing to award an employee temporary total disability benefits beyond March 9, 2010 because there was a substantial basis for its finding that the employee's healing period for the compensable back injury had ended by March 9, 2010.
   Towler v. Tyson Poultry, Inc., 2012 Ark. App. 546, 423 S.W.3d 664 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's opinion displayed a substantial basis for the denial of the employee's claim for an additional period of temporary total-disability benefits because the Commission exercised its duty to assess the weight and credibility of evidence regarding whether the employee's healing period had ended and whether he was totally incapacitated from earning wages, and substantial evidence supported the factual findings that the healing period ended by February 2011 and that the employee was not totally incapacitated from earning wages.

       Substantial evidence supported the denial of additional temporary total disability where, just prior to his release to return to work, the claimant underwent a functional capacity evaluation that reflected that he had put forth an unreliable effort, the ALJ noted that there were multiple examples of inconsistency in effort contained in the report, and mere days days after being cleared for work, the claimant resigned.

      </p>
      <p>
       Award of temporary total disability for a limited period of time was appropriate because there was no medical evidence that the claimant was incapacitated from earning wages after the end of the time period, based on the only medical document addressing the issue, which was an off-work slip from a doctor taking the claimant off work for the limited period of time. There was no medical opinion expressing that claimant was incapacitated from work at any time after that period, and no doctor took him off work beyond the end date of that period.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly reversed the administrative law judge's decision granting temporary total disability benefits to a claimant who slipped and fell on her hands and knees when she was at work on April 22, 2016, because claimant was determined to have reached maximum medical improvement on April 25, 2016, she failed to prove any other compensable injuries other than those to her right arm and left knee, she had been released to return to work, and her own testimony established that her noncompensable back injury was the reason she could not return to work.
   Davis v. Remington Arms Co., 2018 Ark. App. 390, 557 S.W.3d 894 (2018).

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's finding that the surgery performed on the worker was reasonable and necessary and that she remained in her healing period and was entitled to temporary total disability benefits. The authority of the Commission to resolve conflicting evidence extends to medical testimony; thus, the Commission acted within its authority in giving more weight to one doctor's recommendation for surgery than to another doctor's recommendation for a delay, and the award corresponded to both doctors' opinions that the worker had not reached maximum medical recovery.

       Temporary total disability benefits beyond a specific date were properly denied given evidence that the claimant's healing period for his compensable cervical and thoracic strains ended on the date that a physician opined that he had reached maximum medical improvement and the lack of evidence linking the claimant's syrinx to his compensable injury.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision denying a claimant's request for additional temporary total disability benefits was supported by substantial evidence where three medical opinions that his cervicothoracic syrinx was not causally related to his work-related motor vehicle accident conflicted with a fourth physician's report, and the Commission had accepted the medical opinions finding no causal relationship.

       Where the employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while riding to get a tractor from another job site, the fact that the employee was directly advancing his employer's interests trumped any application of the going-and-coming rule.

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in finding that an employee was not performing employment services for her employer when she was injured at the beginning of a mandatory break because the employee was doing something generally required by the employer; by the employer's own admission, the mandatory breaks were given so that all employees could take care of personal business, including getting something to drink or using the restroom, at the same time, which provided a direct benefit to the employer, and while the employee was not required to work during her break, she was required to take a break because the plant shut down.

       In a case in which a workers'
   compensation claimant fell and broke her hip when she stepped outside to revive herself, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's determination that the claimant was not performing employment services at the time of her injury was not supported by substantial evidence. The claimant testified that she exited the building for the sole purpose of regaining alertness, that testimony was supported by all of the evidence, and there was no evidence that she stepped outside the hospital for any purpose related to her own personal comfort or convenience.

       Decision of the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission to award an employee benefits for medical treatment and temporary total disability was supported by substantial evidence because it was for the Commission to determine the credibility of the employee's testimony, and it accepted as credible the employee's version of events; although the employee could not recall the exact location of the incident and did not immediately report the injury to his supervisor, the Commission found credible his claim that he jarred his back when he stepped off of a sidewalk.

       Finding against the employee in his workers'
   compensation action was appropriate pursuant to subdivisions (4)(A)(i) and (B)(iii) of this section because he was not engaged in employment services at the time of his injury. At the time of the injury the employee had completed his daily tasks and had clocked out; he also stated that he was neither on call nor subject to being recalled into the plant.

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in finding that an employee established that she sustained a gradual-onset injury to her right shoulder and in awarding her benefits because there was a lack of substantial evidence supporting its opinion that the employee's bus driver job duties were rapid and repetitive; while the evidence of the employee's opening and closing the bus door touched on the repetitive nature of her job, there was no evidence about the time interval between each event, and that evidence failed to establish the rapidity requirement of subdivision (4)(A)(ii)(

       Substantial evidence supported the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's denial of benefits to a claimant on the ground that the claimant had failed to establish that he sustained a compensable back injury as a result of a fall or from performing numerous strenuous activities during his employment as the claimant did not report a back injury to the employer until nearly three months after his fall, and he did not relate the injury to his fall or any specific incident at work. Moreover, the claimant had worked for the employer for only one and a half years while he had performed equally strenuous work for another employer for twenty-seven years, and he reported back pain several years before he began working for the employer.

       Finding that the employee failed to prove a compensable injury to her right knee in a workers'
   compensation action was appropriate pursuant to subdivision (4)(A)(i) of this section because, at the time that she injured herself, she was merely walking outside to take a smoke break. The employer imposed no work requirements on the employee while she took her breaks and she was not advancing the interests of the employer at the time that she was injured.

   Compensation Commission's finding that an employee's exposure to cobalt dust while at work aggravated his preexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where, in addition to the medical opinions regarding causation, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration study found that the amount of dust in the workplace exceeded acceptable limits, the employee testified that the employer's overhead-exhaust system was not functioning for a period of time while he was exposed to dust, and there was also testimony that an employee who held the employee's job prior to him likewise experienced breathing problems.

   compensation claimant did not show that he suffered a compensable injury under subdivision (4)(A)(i) of this section, as a radiologist stated that the x-rays taken immediately after the work-related incident did not show that the condition of the claimant's knee was any worse or different than it was two years before.

      <p>
       Finding that the employee's injury was not the result of rapid repetitive motion was inappropriate pursuant to subdivision (4)(A) of this section because he was required to walk back and forth across a field over and over all day long and that repetitive motion met the requirement of being rapid as well. The only reasonable conclusion was that the fast-paced repetitive walking caused a blister as a result of the rapid motion of the ill-fitting boots rubbing against his toe.

       There was substantial evidence to support the decision that appellee employee suffered a compensable aggravation of her preexisting cervical problems, because the employee complained of pain in her neck when she first sought medical treatment the day after her accident and her doctor's opinion that the pain in her neck and shoulder was work-related was stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty under subdivision (16)(B) of this section.

       Denial of workers'
   compensation benefits related to the employee's back injury was proper because the objective medical evidence indicated a three-month gap between the date of the accident and the report of the injury, calling into question whether his injury was a result of the work-related accident. Because the medical records made no mention of the ladder incident until the back injury was discovered in June 2010, his testimony was the only evidence linking the injury to the fall and given the three-month span, reasonable persons might disagree as to the actual cause of the injury; thus, he failed to meet his burden under subdivision (4)(E) of this section to prove compensability under subdivision (4)(A)(i).

       Finding that the claimant in a workers'

The claimant presented several physician opinions that linked his cervical problems and his need for treatment to the 2004 incident and established that he was temporarily totally disabled.

       Finding that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered a compensable injury to his left shoulder was appropriate pursuant to subdivisions (4)(A)(i) and (4)(E) of this section because the medical records showed instances where the claimant did not attribute his injury to a specific incident identifiable by the time and place of occurrence, which must be proved in order to establish a compensable injury.

       As there was an obvious, direct correlation between the injury appellant claimed he suffered at work (a blister) and the specific incident he alleged caused that injury (repeatedly walking wearing ill-fitting work-supplied boots), it was not an “unexplained injury”; therefore, he was entitled to benefits under subdivision (4)(A)(i) of this section.

   Compensation Commission found the claimant was not credible and assigned minimal weight to one doctor's report, but found another doctor's statement that the claimant did not have an injury to his head, spine, or neck belied the claimant's assertion in that regard; because the claimant did not establish a causal relationship between his injury and his employment, the conclusion that he did not prove he sustained a compensable injury was supported by substantial evidence.

       Worker was on his lunch break when the injury occurred, he was not required to stay on premises during his break or perform job-related duties, and the injury occurred when the break was only half over and he did not intend to immediately return to work, such that the employer did not benefit from the worker's actions, which were for his own convenience; substantial evidence supported the finding that the injury did not occur within the time and space boundaries of employment and was therefore not compensable.

   Compensation Commission found a compensable injury, as the worker was directly advancing the company's interests at the time of the incident and the company benefitted from the work the worker performed, and it was clear that the Commission's decision to reverse was based on issues of credibility alone; because questions of credibility were the exclusive province of the Commission, the court was foreclosed from determining the weight and credibility to be accorded to the testimony, and the court affirmed.

       Separate injuries or conditions that occur simultaneously or near in time to each other can be compensable, even where the injuries are located in the same body member. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Griffin, 61 Ark. App. 222, 966 S.W.2d 914 (1998).

       Order awarding temporary total disability benefits to an employee was upheld because it was undisputed that the employee sustained an accidental injury, as defined by subdivision (4)(A)(i) of this section, when she fell off a ladder and landed on her back on a concrete floor as treatment, medication and physical therapy were prescribed.

       Injury to heart by breathing excessive amounts of dust was not one which appellee might have reasonably expected or anticipated and was therefore accidental within the meaning of former Workers' Compensation Law although it continued over a period of years.

       Injury was not due to accident where evidence showed that injury was not due to any specific incident but was the result of heavy lifting over a period of time in the normal course of employment. Stallings Bros. Feed Mill v. Stovall, 221 Ark. 541, 254 S.W.2d 460 (1953).

       An injury is accidental when either the cause or result is unexpected or accidental, although the work being done is usual or ordinary. Bryant Stave & Heading Co. v.

       Accidental injury means every injury to an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment except those injuries caused by his intoxication or by his willful intention to bring about the injury or death of himself or another.

       The adjective accidental refers to and modifies the noun injury, and does not refer to the cause of the injury. There is no statutory requirement that the cause of injury itself must have also been accidental. Bryant Stave & Heading Co. v. White, 227 Ark. 147, 296 S.W.2d 436 (1956).

       Claimant did not prove by a preponderance of evidence that she experienced a compensable injury under subdivision (5)(A)(i), caused by a specific incident and identifiable by time and place of occurrence, as opposed to experiencing a gradual injury.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       An aggravation is a new injury resulting from an independent incident; the independent incident must be shown to be work-related, and, under subdivision (5)(A)(i), it must be shown that the accidental injury was caused by a specific incident identifiable by time and place of occurrence. Farmland Ins. Co. v. DuBois, 54 Ark. App. 141, 923 S.W.2d 883 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of benefits to the employee in a workers' compensation action was proper where substantial evidence supported the determination that the employee sustained an aggravation of her pre-existing condition; the positive bone scan was an objective medical finding of injury that was out of the employee's control and it formed the basis for the recommendation of surgery. Heritage Baptist Temple v. Robison, 82 Ark. App. 460, 120 S.W.3d 150 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' Compensation Commission erred in finding that the employee had failed to prove a casual connection between her compensable injury and her need for total-knee-replacement surgery; the employer and insurer had to take the employee as they found her, and the compensable injury that she suffered was a factor in her need for the additional surgery. Williams v. L & W Janitorial, Inc., 85 Ark. App. 1, 145 S.W.3d 383 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the employee's permanent benefits was error where the employee's back disease did not require surgery or any other medical treatment prior to the compensable aggravation; there was no evidence that the employee was assigned any rating for his pre-existing stenosis, and there was evidence that his impairment resulted from the aggravation that caused the need for surgery. Pollard v. Meridian Aggregates, 88 Ark. App. 1, 193 S.W.3d 738 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was substantial evidence that claimant suffered a new injury and a compensable aggravation resulting from the independent incident where claimant testified that, after squatting down and opening his laptop on February 7, 2001, he started to get up and was knocked to the ground by severe pain in his back and right side; his testimony that his back was “crooked” following the severe pain experienced in the incident was credible and his physical therapist stated that he observed a decreased lumbar lordosis on March 5, 2001.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly found that an employee sustained a new compensable injury and was entitled to temporary total disability benefits and attorney's fees after he felt abrupt, excruciating pain as he stepped down from an excavator and required help to take him to a hospital; while the employee had preexisting chronic back pain, a new MRI showed, and two doctors stated, that the employee's spine had new and/or different injuries.

       Employment circumstances that aggravate preexisting conditions are compensable; an aggravation is a new injury resulting from an independent incident and must be evidenced by objective medical findings of a new injury to the preexisting condition.

       When the servant acts with reference to the services for which he is employed and for the purpose of performing the work of his employer, and not for any independent purpose of his own, but merely for the benefit of his master, acts done in such circumstances are within the scope of the servant's employment, but the master is not responsible where a servant acts without reference to the service for which he is employed, but to effect some independent purpose of his own.

       An accidental injury arises out of the employment when the required exertion producing the injury is too great for the person undertaking the work, whatever the degree of exertion or the condition of his health, provided the exertion is either the sole or a contributing cause of the injury.

      </p>

       There is no presumption that a claim for workers' compensation comes within the purview of the law, i.e., that it arose out of and in the course of the claimant's employment. O.K. Processing, Inc. v. Servold, 265 Ark. 352, 578 S.W.2d 224 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase arising out of the employment refers to the origin or cause of the accident and the phrase in the course of the employment refers to the time, place and circumstances under which the injury occurred; in order for an injury to arise out of the employment, it must be a natural and probable consequence or incident of the employment and a natural result of one of its risks. J. & G. Cabinets v. Hennington, 269 Ark. 789, 600 S.W.2d 916 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Activities of a personal nature, not forbidden but reasonably to be expected, may be a material incident of the employment and injuries suffered in the course of the activities are compensable, the fact that the injury is suffered during a lunch break, when the employee is not required to be on the premises, does not alter this principle since the controlling issue is whether the activity is reasonably expectable so as to be an incident of the employment, and thus in essence a part of it. J. & G. Cabinets v. Hennington, 269 Ark. 789, 600 S.W.2d 916 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The workers' compensation commission should follow a liberal approach in determining whether the accident in fact grew out of and occurred in the course of the employment and it is the duty of the commission to draw all legitimate inferences possible in favor of the claimant and to give the claimant the benefit of doubt.

      <p>
       Minor acts of horseplay do not automatically constitute departures from employment but may be found to be insubstantial. Whether initiation of horseplay is a deviation from one's course of employment depends on (1) the extent and seriousness of the deviation; (2) the completeness of the deviation (i.e., whether it was commingled with the performance of duty or involved an abandonment of duty); (3) the extent to which the practice of horseplay had become an accepted part of the employment; and (4) the extent to which the nature of the employment may be expected to include some such horseplay.

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that an injured employee may have been the instigator of, rather than a mere participant in horseplay, will not necessarily render the injury noncompensable. Ringier Am. v. Combs, 41 Ark. App. 47, 849 S.W.2d 1 (1993).

       Under subdivision (4)(B)(iii), an employee's injury that occurred while he was on a restroom break was not excluded from the definition of “compensable injury” because the injury did not occur at a time when he was not performing employment services; the restroom break was a necessary function and directly or indirectly advanced the interests of his employer.

      <p>
       Where Department of Correction employee was injured while travelling to a required staff meeting at his normal place of work on his day off, he was properly denied workers' compensation benefits; merely traveling to and from the workplace was not a covered activity under the workers' compensation statutes and it was not clear that the “special errand” exception was still valid after the passage of Acts 1993, No. 796, which revised the definition of a “compensable injury.” Linton v.

      <p>
       Given the evidence that the injury occurred before the claimant's work shift had started, and while claimant was outside the territorial jurisdiction of the sheriff's department by which he was employed, the Workers' Compensation Commission could reasonably have concluded that his injury was sustained at a time when employment services were not being performed. Maupin v. Pulaski County Sheriff's Office, 90 Ark. App. 1, 203 S.W.3d 668 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers Compensation Commission erred in denying employee's claim for benefits as employee was injured in an area in which employment services were expected of her and she was furthering her employer's interests when she was injured; an employee may be compensated for an injury that occurs even before she reaches her work station or before she is “on the clock” if she is performing a service that is required by her employer and is directly or indirectly advancing her employer's interests.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where benefits claimant had been required to attend a corporate meeting and demonstration prior to his scheduled shift, injuries he suffered in a car accident on the way to work from the demonstration were compensable because he was on a special errand and traveling from one job site to another; thus, the going-and-coming rule did not preclude the award of benefits.

       Slip and fall injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment, as required by subdivision (4)(A)(i) of this section, because appellant truck driver was not advancing his employer's interests in any way while he was operating a vending machine away from the area in which his truck was being unloaded. While in the break room, he could not have seen his truck had someone hit it, he could not have seen any damage inflicted upon the products being unloaded, and he was not in an area where he could have determined whether someone needed him to move the truck for any reason.

       Pursuant to subdivision (4)(B)(iii) of this section, a truck driver's injury—caused when he fell while buying snack crackers at a vending machine— was not compensable because it was inflicted upon him at a time when employment services were not being performed. The act of pushing the vending machine buttons could not be said to directly or indirectly advance the interests of his employer.

   compensation benefits failed to prove that the claimant's injury arose out of and in the course of the claimant's employment because the claimant was on a personal errand to retrieve food for the claimant's own benefit when the claimant injured the claimant's knee in a slip and fall accident while stepping into an elevator at the hospital where the claimant worked.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission, which determined that a claimant sustained a compensable injury arising out of and in the course of her employment, could reasonably conclude that the claimant's briefly leaving her workstation to get a snack did not detract from her job duties, which benefited her employer, directly or indirectly. There was nothing in the record to suggest that the claimant's actions were inconsistent with her employer's interest in advancing the work.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that a truck driver in training sustained a compensable injury was supported by substantial evidence where, as a trainee, the driver was expected to study or practice backing up the truck, the injury occurred within the truck during a period when the driver was not enjoying a leisure time off or free to do as he pleased, and reasonable minds could have concluded that a discussion of the testimony concerning the timing of a Facebook post was unnecessary in reconciling conflicting evidence.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in awarding benefits to the claimant, an administrative assistant, because reasonable minds could conclude that the claimant was acting within the scope and course of her employment and directly or indirectly advancing her employer's interests when she slipped and fell, and, whether she was technically “on” or “off” the clock was not dispositive, as the claimant was expected to respond to work queries if she was approached away from her desk or before her regular work hours began; and the claimant was inside the building, and was on her way to her office when she was injured.

       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that a housekeeper failed to establish a compensable injury because she was not performing employment services at the time of the accident; substantial evidence supported the Commission's finding that the housekeeper was on her way to lunch when she fell in the lobby because she told the human resources office immediately following the incident that she fell when she was going to lunch and both the human resources officer and the housekeeping supervisor testified that the housekeeper was walking toward the front door when she fell.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that the claimant was performing employment services at the time she was injured because she testified that during her break she remained on duty and in the building, she was clocked in, and she remained on call and available to work; she testified that she was the only unit coordinator on her shift and that if she had been called to return to her desk based on an emergency or a trauma, she would have been required to do so; she stated that she had been called back three or four times in the past; and the employer derived a benefit from the claimant's remaining in the building, immediately available to resume her duties.

       In the cases of assaults, the positional risk doctrine applies only when the risk is neutral; neutral means that the risk which caused the injury was neither personal to the claimant nor distinctly associated with the employment. In other words, before the doctrine will be applied there must be no evidence that the assault was personal and no evidence that the assault was work related. Pigg v. Auto Shack, 27 Ark. App. 42, 766 S.W.2d 36 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant, a maintenance worker and security guard, was injured in the course of his employment when he was assaulted by a trespasser who refused to leave the property; because the risk of assault was increased by the nature of the claimant's work, the injury arose out of his employment. Bryan v. Best Western/Coachman's Inn, 47 Ark. App. 75, 885 S.W.2d 28 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       An assault arises out of the employment either if the risk of assault is increased by the nature or setting of the work (regardless of the reason for the assault), or if the reason for the assault was a quarrel having its origin in the work; the test is an alternative one and the satisfaction of either condition will render injuries received as the result of an assault compensable. Bryan v. Best Western/Coachman's Inn, 47 Ark. App. 75, 885 S.W.2d 28 (1994).

       Actions of employee who was injured while attempting to break up a fight between her son and another worker, both of whom were also employees, were held to be in the best interests of the employer and thus the injury arose out of and in the course of employment.

       An employee was entitled to benefits for injuries sustained in an incident in which another employee pulled a chair out from under her while she was changing from work clothes into street clothes as the injured employee was not an “active participant” in the assault that caused her injury.

       In a workers compensation action, a bank teller failed to establish that she suffered a compensable injury under subdivision (4)(A)(i) of this section when a gunman attacked her in her home and she injured her wrist as she fled. She was not within the scope of her employment as there was no evidence that he was after her bank key or vault codes.

      <p>
       Award of workers'
   compensation benefits to the employee for compensable injuries was appropriate because he did not fall within the exclusion under subdivision (4)(B)(i) of this section since he was not an active participant in the assault against him. Additionally, the risk of assault was increased by the employee's work setting.

      </p>
      <p>
       The positional risk doctrine provides a method of satisfying the “in the course of” requirement where the source of the injury is unexplained. An injury “arises out of” the employment if it would not have occurred but for the fact that the conditions and obligations of the employment placed claimant in the position where he was injured.

       Based on the Workers' Compensation Commission's credibility determination concerning the employee's testimony, the letter indicating that the employee had previously made complaints regarding neck pain, and the MRI proving that the employee had in fact sustained an injury to her cervical spine, the Commission had correctly found that the employee had met her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she sustained a compensable neck injury in addition to her low-back injury.

       Carpal tunnel syndrome claimants must prove rapid repetitive motion to sustain a claim for a compensable injury; carpal tunnel syndrome is not exempted from the proof requirement of other gradual-onset injuries, but is merely listed as an example of a type of gradual-onset injury that may be proven by evidence of rapid repetitive motion.

       If there is a causal connection between a primary compensable injury and the subsequent disability, there is no independent intervening cause unless the subsequent disability is triggered by activity of the claimant that is “unreasonable under the circumstances.” Davis v. Old Dominion Freight Line, 341 Ark. 751, 20 S.W.3d 326 (2000).

      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission properly denied death benefits to a deceased worker’s surviving beneficiaries because the decedent had been using opiates for some time prior to his compensable injury, had a proclivity to drug addiction, and the decedent’s overdose and resultant death was unreasonable and an independent intervening cause not related to the work where he took a substantial overdose of methadone that was not in response to uncontrolled pain, but was instead simply the result of his drug addiction.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly awarded an employee additional-medical benefits because he had been receiving various benefits for nearly two years before he filed an AR-C Form, the first hearing on the employee's claim for additional-medical benefits was held more than eight years later, the “additional follow-up care” sought by the employee was reasonably necessary medical treatment, and a subsequent car wreck was not an independent intervening cause of the employee's need for further medical treatment where his conduct was not unreasonable and he was never restricted from driving by any doctor.

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the findings that a worker's compensation claimant, who had worked as a correctional officer for 23 years, was entitled to 20% wage-loss disability in addition to a 3% anatomical rating and that the compensable back injury was the major cause of the disability, despite the employer's contention that an unauthorized surgery constituted a nonwork-related independent intervening cause that was improperly considered in awarding wage loss. The findings were based on proper wage-loss factors, the opinion adequately discussed the rationale, and the causation findings were supported by the claimant's testimony and medical evidence.

       When a vehicle is supplied by the employer for mutual benefit of himself and the worker to facilitate the progress of the work, the employment begins when the workman enters the vehicle and ends when he leaves it on the termination of his labor.

      <p>
       Exceptions to the general rule that an employee is not in the course of his employment while going to or returning from his home in which off-premises injuries are held compensable, involved situation (1) where the employee is subject to call at all hours, and (2) when the employee has a duty to perform for the employer while en route home. Arkansas Power & Light Co. v. Cox, 229 Ark. 20, 313 S.W.2d 91 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Question as to whether or not injury of employee who has left employer's premises is compensable was not how near he may have been to his employer's premises when he was injured but whether he was performing any duty in connection with his employment or was at the point of the accident at his employer's direction, or was using facilities supplied by the employer.

       The criteria for applying the special hazard exception to the going and coming rule is not sheer distance or proximity but rather the causal connection between the injury and the employment, nor is the exception necessarily inapplicable due to the existence of an alternate route. Bechtel Corp. v. Winther, 262 Ark. 361, 556 S.W.2d 882 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for an injury incurred while the employee is going to work to be compensable, the employee must fall within one of the exceptions to the going and coming rule such as where an employee is injured while in close proximity to the employer's premises, where the employer furnishes the transportation to or from work, where the employee is a traveling salesman, where the employee is injured on a special mission or errand, or when the employer compensates the employee for his time from the moment he leaves home until he returns home. City of Sherwood v. Lowe, 4 Ark. App. 161, 628 S.W.2d 610 (1982).

       An injury sustained by a worker riding in a private automobile while going home from work is not a compensable one where the employer pays an insubstantial portion of the travel expense. Chicot Mem. Hosp. v. Veazey, 9 Ark. App. 18, 652 S.W.2d 631 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Injury during a trip which serves both a business and a personal purpose is within the course of employment if the work of the employee creates the necessity for travel; if, however, the work has had no part in creating the necessity for travel, if the journey would have gone forward though the business errand had been dropped, and would have been canceled upon failure of the private purpose, though the business errand was undone, the travel is then personal, and personal the risk. Rankin v. Rankin Constr. Co., 12 Ark. App. 1, 669 S.W.2d 911 (1984); Fisher v. Proksch, 20 Ark. App. 80, 723 S.W.2d 852 (1987).

       Employee was in the course of his employment when he turned from his route to the restaurant where he was employed to go to the catering kitchen to pick up the equipment he had been directed to return to the restaurant, as it is clear that someone would have had to get this equipment and take it to the restaurant and once the employee turned toward the catering kitchen for that purpose, he was, at least, on a “dual-purpose” journey and therefore in the course of his employment. Jane Traylor, Inc. v. Cooksey, 31 Ark. App. 245, 792 S.W.2d 351 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The risk of injury during the course of a trip by the claimant to retrieve forgotten medication needed for a compensable first injury is one which, on balance, ought not to be borne by the employer, thus, the second injury sustained during such a trip is not compensable. Wolfe v. City of El Dorado, 33 Ark. App. 25, 799 S.W.2d 812 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A determination that a trip falls within the “dual purpose” exception to the going and coming rule does not end the inquiry; instead, the dual purpose doctrine merely serves to label the overall trip as either business or personal: deviations from the main purpose require a separate inquiry. Day v. Central Day Care, Inc., 38 Ark. App. 241, 833 S.W.2d 783 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant had completed her employer's errand and was returning to work in her vehicle, the commission could properly find that slipping on ice while pursuing a personal errand was a risk of the deviation, rather than of the employment.

       Some nexus between the employment and travel must be present in order for a claimant to recover for injuries sustained on a trip from his employer's premises to his home. Lepard v. West Memphis Mach. & Welding, 51 Ark. App. 53, 908 S.W.2d 666 (1995).

       Although claimant was not directly compensated for her travel time, because traveling was an inherent and necessary incident of the claimant's required employment activity, the claimant was “performing employment services” under subdivision (5)(B)(iii) when she was injured while en route from her employer's office to a client's home. Olsten Kimberly Quality Care v. Pettey, 55 Ark. App. 343, 934 S.W.2d 956 (1996), aff'd, 328 Ark. 381, 944 S.W.2d 524 (1997).

       Where claimant's laboratory test results showed high levels of cannabinoids in his urine on the day he was injured, under subdivision (5)(B)(iv), this created a rebuttable presumption that his injury was substantially occasioned by the use of illegal drugs.

       This section does not require that the Commission promulgate drug-testing procedures or specify particular types of tests to be used as a precondition to the intoxication presumption in subdivision (5)(B)(iv); the Arkansas General Assembly could have required testing that would show a certain level of illegal drugs, as it has required to invoke the presumption in D.W.I. cases, but it has not made such a requirement.

       A blood-alcohol level of less than 0.01% was low enough to rebut the presumption that employee's injury was substantially occasioned by alcohol. ERC Contractor Yard & Sales v. Robertson, 60 Ark. App. 310, 961 S.W.2d 36 (1998), aff'd, 335 Ark. 63, 977 S.W.2d 212 (Ark. 1998).

       A worker failed to rebut the presumption that his motor vehicle accident was caused by the use of illegal drugs where he tested positive for opiates and cocaine metabolites and the only evidence presented to rebut the presumption was his own uncorroborated testimony concerning the nature and extent of his drug use and his own uncorroborated testimony regarding his interpretation of the cause of his accident.

       An employee rebutted the presumption that a motor vehicle accident in which he was involved was substantially occasioned by the use of alcohol, notwithstanding that he was found to have a blood alcohol level of .021 percent, where he was driving between 6:00 and 7:00 PM. on a two-lane road under the posted speed limit, it was raining and foggy, his trailer was empty, he was cut off by another vehicle, he passed a field sobriety test administered by the investigating officer, and he was not cited for being under the influence of alcohol.

       An employee who tested positive for marijuana metabolites 2 days after an accident in which he fell through a hole cut in the roof of a new building while carrying a 4 foot by 16 foot board with his supervisor rebutted the statutory presumption that his injury was substantially occasioned by the use of marijuana where he testified that he had not smoked marijuana on the day of the accident or in the preceding few days, the manner in which he carried the board prevented him from seeing the hole, and he was fatigued because he had worked 7 days in a row and was in his 28th hour of overtime.

       The phrase “substantially occasioned by the use of alcohol” requires that there be a direct causal link between the injury and the use of alcohol, rather than the abstinence from the use of alcohol, and, therefore, the fact that the claimant's accident was caused by an alcohol-withdrawal seizure did not allow a finding that the accident was substantially related to the use of alcohol. ERC Contr. Yard & Sales v. Robertson, 335 Ark. 63, 977 S.W.2d 212 (Ark. 1998).

       Evidence held sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption that the claimant's injury was substantially occasioned by the use of alcohol where (1) the claimant's supervisor testified that the claimant did not use alcohol on the day of his accident, (2) the medical reports reflected that the claimant told his doctors that he did not use alcohol on the day of the accident, (3) the claimant's girlfriend told his doctors that the claimant did not use alcohol on the day of the accident, and (4) the claimant's doctors concurred that a seizure related to alcohol-withdrawal syndrome caused the claimant's accident.

       The presence of alcohol in an employee's body was not proven simply by testimony that his breath smelled of alcohol, since the evidence presented did not negate the reasonable hypothesis that such smell might have come from his previous night's drinking, especially in light of his testimony that he drank several beers the night before his accident, that he slept in his clothes and wore the clothes to work the next morning, and that he did not brush his teeth prior to departing for work. Flowers v. Norman Oaks Constr. Co., 68 Ark. App. 239, 6 S.W.3d 118 (1999), rev'd, 341 Ark. 474, 17 S.W.3d 472 (2000).

       In a proceeding pertaining to the electrocution of a tree service employee which occurred when he was struck in the face by an energized wire which fell from a tree branch he picked up, the Workers' Compensation Commission properly found that the presence of marijuana metabolites in the employee's system constituted the presence of an illegal drug and therefore invoked the rebuttable presumption found in subsection (5)(B)(iv)(

      <p>
       A finding of the presence of alcohol in the claimant's body was supported by substantial evidence, notwithstanding the absence of medical testing, where (1) the claimant admitted that he drank 6 to 8 beers the night before the accident, and stated that he went to bed by 11:00 or 11:30 p.m. the night before the accident and left for work on the morning of the accident at about 6:30 a.m., (2) upon arrival at the accident scene, paramedics noted a strong smell of alcohol about the claimant at 8:45 a.m., (3) the registered nurse at the hospital reported that the claimant had a smell of alcohol about his breath, (4) when the claimant was readmitted to the hospital a week later complaining of hallucinations, his medical records stated that he admitted that he habitually drank a twelve-pack or six-pack of beer a day, and (5) there was circumstantial evidence that the claimant drank at the job site.

       The presence of alcohol in an employee's body need not be proven by medical testing but can also be proven by testimony that a claimant was seen consuming alcohol prior to his accident, had slurred speech, and was unsteady on his feet.

       Evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption that the claimant's injury was caused by her use of intoxicants where (1) the claimant's hand was caught in a press she was operating, (2) a drug test two days later found codeine and methamphetamine in her system, and (3) the plant supervisor testified that within a 24 hour period another person was injured while running the same machine, that he personally checked the safety devices on the machine on the date of the accident, and that since the accident the company had put a double hand control button on the press, and (4) the safety supervisor testified that the accident was caused by a “pinch point” and that it was corrected with a double hand-actuating device.

   Compensation Commission properly awarded temporary total-disability benefits to an employee because the Commission found that the employer and its insurance carrier failed to establish the presence of illegal drugs in the employee's body, and the rebuttable statutory presumption was not triggered; no urine, blood, or hair-follicle test was administered, no drug or drug paraphernalia was found on the employee's person, and, while the employee allegedly said that he ingested methamphetamine within 24 hours of the accident, no medical personnel were questioned about what he supposedly said, and the employee's testimony that he was still being treated for his injury was substantial evidence that he was within his healing period when the hearing occurred.

       Appellate court affirmed the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision denying an employee's claim for benefits based on his failure to rebut the statutory presumption that the accident was substantially occasioned by alcohol; although witnesses testified that there was no indication that the employee was intoxicated, the employee's blood tested positive for alcohol at the hospital on the morning of his one-car accident, which had occurred while he was driving to the airport to travel to meet with an out-of-state customer, and a physician/toxicologist, who testified as an expert witness, opined that alcohol contributed significantly to the cause of the accident.

       The standard for determining “rapid repetitive motion” is a two-pronged test: (1) the tasks must be repetitive, and (2) the repetitive motion must be rapid. Malone v. Texarkana Pub. Sch., 333 Ark. 343, 969 S.W.2d 644 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission erred by applying a definition of “rapid repetitive motion” that had been rejected and held to be too restrictive when it determined that, although the claimant's job involved the use of her hands in all of her duties, it did not require the exact or almost exact movement again and again for prolonged periods of time sufficient to constitute rapid, repetitive motion. Malone v. Texarkana Pub. Sch., 333 Ark. 343, 969 S.W.2d 644 (1998).

       The claimant, who was a custodian in a public school, failed to establish an injury caused by rapid repetitive motion where the claimant performed several different tasks each day and her supervisor testified that her work was not rapid in nature.

       An incisional hernia caused by gradual heavy lifting was not a compensable injury caused by rapid repetitive motion; although the motion which caused the injury was repetitive, it was not rapid. Jobe v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 66 Ark. App. 114, 987 S.W.2d 764 (1999).

       Evidence established that rapid repetitive motion caused the claimant's bilateral knee injuries where she spent a substantial amount of time making back and forth motions on her knees while stocking store shelves. Patterson v. Frito Lay, Inc., 66 Ark. App. 159, 992 S.W.2d 130 (1999).

       Epicondylitis, or “tennis elbow,” has not been designated as a specifically recognized injury under “rapid repetitive motion,” and, consequently, a claimant bears the burden of proving that rapid repetitive motion caused such condition.

      <p>
       The claimant established that her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and bilateral epicondylitis, or “tennis elbow,” arose out of and in the course of her employment, which involved assembling frozen dinner trays on a production line, where (1) she testified that her duty on the production line was to place the correct portion of food into the frozen dinner tray, making certain that there was not too much nor too little food in each triangle portion of the tray, and that she was responsible for filling approximately 65 dinners per minute, and (2) a physician opined that her conditions were consistent with her job description.

       Evidence was sufficient to establish that the claimant's neck injury was caused by rapid repetitive movement where (1) over the course of a nine to ten hour shift, the claimant completed 316 units, each of which had six screws, and (2) the claimant testified that she had to stoop over and bend her head or neck a little for each screw inserted into every unit.

       The Workers' Compensation Commission erred in denying benefits for the claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome, notwithstanding that she first experienced shooting pains in her wrists while wiping up some spilled tea from a kitchen counter in her home and admitted that she did not initially report problems she had with her hands because she believed that pain was simply a “part of the job,” where (1) the claimant testified in detail about her job duties that required extensive use of her hands and wrists and also testified that she had no prior injury that could be related to her current problems and denied engaging in any outside activities that could have caused carpal tunnel syndrome, (2) the claimant submitted her medical records, which included the medical opinions of two of her treating physicians, (3) one physician stated in his letter that the claimant's injuries were overuse-type injuries consistent with her job duties, and (4) the second physician concurred with the first physician that the claimant's injuries were usage-related type injuries often associated with repetitive motions, but declined to state definitively whether the claimant's job, or some outside activities, were the cause of her injuries.

       Employee, a volleyball coach and physical-education teacher, did not establish that she sustained a gradual-onset throat injury caused by rapid repetitive motion as the Workers' Compensation Commission improperly applied prior case law in finding the internal vibrations of the vocal cords to be tasks as opposed to the act of speech.

   compensation benefits were properly awarded to a claimant due to a cumulative trauma to her left knee as a rapid repetitive motion injury under this section where the claimant had to move constantly, had to climb ladders for 5 hours of an 8-hour shift, and had to move quickly in order to make quota. Substantial evidence supported the findings that the repetitive and rapidity elements were met.

       Argument that the Workers'

      <p>
       To determine whether an injury arises out of employment, the Commission should apply the same rule to sexual harassment cases that it applies in assault cases: an injury arises out of the employment if the risk is increased by the nature or setting of the work; whether sexual harassment is a risk to which an employee is exposed because of the nature of the work environment is a fact that should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

       The claimant's neck injury was not compensable on the basis that it was caused by a specific incident and was identifiable by time and place of occurrence where the claimant's own deposition testimony reflected that she did not know how she was injured, that she did not recall anything specific happening, and that she did not tell her treating physician that her pain was associated with any particular, specific incident.

       Employee failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she sustained an injury to her left shoulder resulting from a specific incident where employer's medical department supervisor testified that she helped employee file the first report of injury and that employee described the injury to herself as something that gradually happened to her shoulder after shoveling ice the previous month; the court could not say that no reasonable, fair-minded person could have reached the conclusion arrived at by the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission. Dorris v. Townsends of Ark., Inc., 93 Ark. App. 208, 218 S.W.3d 351 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding that the employee failed to prove a compensable injury caused by a specific incident identifiable by time and place of occurrence was proper under subdivision (4)(A) of this section because his treating physicians reported no acute event but instead indicated that he developed an injury to his toe by working in work boots that were too narrow. The employee testified that he did not feel any soreness until he had been working his regular duties for a couple of hours.

       Substantial evidence did not support the conclusion that the claimant's motor vehicle accident was substantially occasioned by his use of alcohol where (1) both drivers had a blood alcohol content of more than twice the legal limit at the time of the accident, but (2) the other driver came completely over into the claimant's lane and struck his vehicle head-on, and (3) although a time stamped receipt in the claimant's vehicle showed that he had been speeding at some point, there was no evidence that he was speeding at the time of the accident or that he could have avoided the accident.

       Where worker began to experience pain and it was determined that her rapid repetitive motion injury was an aggravation of a preexisting condition, the appellate court held that the Workers' Compensation Commission was clearly wrong in its decision that the “major cause” requirement of subdivision (4)(E) of this section categorically could not be established by a showing that an asymptomatic preexisting condition became symptomatic and required treatment due to a work-related aggravation of that condition.

       In a workers'

       Neck injury was not compensable because physician failed to state that the alleged work injury was the major cause for the need for treatment, and claimant testified that she could not figure out where else she would have sustained extensive wear and tear on her neck.

       Workers'

       Physician's diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome was not supported by “objective findings” as defined by subdivision (16)(A)(i) where the results of each of the tests performed by the physician were based on the patient's description of the sensations produced by various stimuli; such descriptions are clearly under the voluntary control of the patient and therefore, by statutory definition, do not constitute objective findings.

       There was no objective medical evidence of the claimant's injury where the only arguably objective medical evidence of the injury was a notation at a clinic that there was a contusion of the lumbar spine, but reasonable minds could conclude that a contusion to such an internal structure could not be seen and therefore did not constitute objective medical evidence of an injury.

       X-ray showed soft tissue swelling in the worker's right ankle, which could be an objective medical finding, plus an MRI, which showed swelling and that a tendon was torn, was a diagnostic test that was objective and outside the workers's control; there was no prior medical history showing that the worker had been diagnosed with a torn tendon before the fall at work, and thus there was substantial medical evidence supported by objective findings.

       “Objective findings” under this section are those findings which cannot come under the control of the patient, and all of the medical evidence related to the injury, other than the x-ray, were based on the worker's subjective complaints; thus, the Workers'

       Workers' Compensation Commission determined that the claimant was entitled to a 10% permanent partial-disability rating because the 10% rating was supported by objective medical findings, including the post-injury MRI, which confirmed abnormalities in the claimant's brain; the abnormalities were causally related to the October 31, 2011, compensable injury; the claimant proved that the compensable injury was the major cause of his 10% permanent anatomical-impairment rating; and the doctor, based upon patient history, examination, the MRI, and the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, used his medical expertise to render an opinion concerning the claimant's permanent impairment.

       Substantial evidence supported the Workers' Compensation Commission's decision that a claimant was entitled to a 29% permanent impairment rating to the body as a whole for a brain injury because the severity of the claimant's skull fractures and the presence of pneumocephalus on the claimant's CT scan, coupled with the testimony of a clinical psychologist and a board-certified neurologist that the claimant suffered a brain injury, established that the claimant did, in fact, suffer a compensable injury to the brain.

       Workers' Compensation Commission's finding that a claimant was not entitled to permanent impairment benefits for the claimant's nerve-injury claims was appropriate because the impairment rating established by a board-certified neurologist was based solely on the claimant's level of pain.

       Although compensable injuries must be established by medical evidence supported by objective findings, and complaints of pain are not objective medical findings as objective findings are those that cannot come under the voluntary control of the patient, a claimant who has sustained a compensable injury is not required to offer objective medical evidence to prove entitlement to additional benefits.

       Because the Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not arbitrarily reject the orthopedic surgeon's medical opinion, the opinion was not considered in determining whether substantial evidence supported the decision that the bus driver sustained a compensable injury. Without the opinion, the bus driver's credible testimony and the post-accident medical evidence showed a left shoulder sprain, the subsequent MRI showed a tear in the left shoulder, and thus substantial evidence supported the decision that the driver sustained a compensable injury.

   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that a diagnosis of “contusion” met the claimant's burden of proving a compensable back injury supported by objective medical findings; the alleged conflict about a contusion diagnosis was contained within the same emergency-room record, and the Commission gave little weight to a physician's subsequent opinion over one month after the incident that there was no objective evidence of an injury.

       There was a substantial basis for denying an employee's whole-hand/wrist and permanent impairment claims because (1) the administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the employee lacked credibility, (2) aside from an MRI report supporting the compensated thumb injury, the ALJ concluded that there were no objective medical findings of a hand injury attributable to the work injury and no impairment reports aside from an active range-of-motion evaluation, which was given little weight, and (3) swelling in the hand was slight and attributed to the effects of wearing an elastic hand brace.

       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's denial of benefits based on an alleged work-related injury in September 2003 because the claimant failed to put forth any medical evidence supported by objective findings demonstrating that he suffered a compensable aggravation of his previous back injury. It was undisputed that the claimant suffered from chronic, severe back pain since at least 1997 and he admitted that he never fully recovered from that injury, and continued seeking treatment and medication without significant improvement; after the claimant's injury in September 2003, his treating physician did not indicate any sort of work-related accident or injury in his notes from an examination of the claimant two days after the incident and did not indicate any objective findings such as bruising, swelling, or spasms in the claimant's back.

       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's denial of benefits based on an alleged work-related injury in September 2003 because the claimant failed to put forth any medical evidence supported by objective findings demonstrating that he suffered a compensable aggravation of his previous back injury. It was undisputed that the claimant suffered from chronic, severe back pain since at least 1997 and he admitted that he never fully recovered from that injury, and continued seeking treatment and medication without significant improvement; after the claimant's injury in September 2003, his treating physician did not indicate any sort of work-related accident or injury in his notes from an examination of the claimant two days after the incident and did not indicate any objective findings such as bruising, swelling, or spasms in the claimant's back.

       Circuit court did not have jurisdiction over a wrongful death claim filed by an estate due to the fact that the Workers'

       Administrator's wrongful death suit against decedent's employer and insurance carrier was properly dismissed on the grounds of the exclusive remedy provision of this section; administrator's argument that the claim did not sound in tort but on an indemnity contract between the employer and the city was without merit because the administrator was merely an incidental, not intended, third party beneficiary.

       Where Arkansas' workers' compensation law provided that an injured employee who did not receive the necessary benefits was allowed to file a workers' compensation claim or file a complaint in circuit court, the Arkansas rule of law was better than the Louisiana rule of law, which would have prevented the injured person's negligence suit against a non-employer corporation, thereby foreclosing the injured person's day in court; thus, the Arkansas rule applied despite the fact that the accident itself occurred in Louisiana.

The fact that an employer may be protected from be sued under the Arkansas'

      <p>
       Benefits claimant was an employee of both a staffing agency and a company under the dual employment doctrine for purposes of the exclusive-remedy provision of this statute; both the claimant and the company operated on a belief that the claimant would have full-time employment after logging a certain amount of hours. The fact that the implied employment contract was instituted through a temporary employment agency did not negate the fact of the claimant's dual employments.
   Randolph v. Staffmark, 2015 Ark. App. 135, 456 S.W.3d 389 (2015).

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that dual employment existed and that a company was a special employer immune from suit where there was a shared-services agreement between the company and a temporary-employment agency; the company had a workers'
   compensation policy in effect at the time of the employee's injury and was not required to prove that the employee was actually covered by the policy to be entitled to the exclusive-remedy provisions.

       When an employee is able to show actual, specific and deliberate intent by the employer to injure him, he may avoid the exclusive remedy provisions and proceed in a common-law tort action, i.e., the employee has the option to pursue his claim for damages either in tort or under this chapter; however, once the employee makes that election, the employee may not later avail himself of the remedy not chosen.

       In order to establish liability on the part of a freight lessor, a freight carrier, and a healthcare company under subsection (b) of this section, a truck driver, who injured his back while disconnecting a trailer from his truck, was required to demonstrate negligence on their part since, under the plain meaning of subsection (b), the no-fault theory of workers'
   compensation did not carry over to suits filed in tort. The statute did not state that suits filed in tort were to be based on a theory of strict liability, and under the rule of strict construction, no such intent could be inferred.

       Where the employee was required to do the same work with the same exposure after he was injured the first time, the only remedies available to the employee were those pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act, since the employer's actions were not of such magnitude as to constitute an intentional tort and thereby removed the employer from the protection of the act.

   compensation insurance policy in effect. Unless the workers'

       When the injured construction worker's complaint in circuit court alleged that the employer failed to provide workers'

       Even though no answer was filed, the allegation in the injured worker's complaint that the employer “failed to provide workers'

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction over an employee's tort claims against a corporation and its owner, and in deciding that the corporation and owner were immune under subsection (a) of this section because there was no employment relationship between the employee and the corporation and owner.

       In employee's products liability action against the manufacturer of the product that injured him while he was working, the circuit court properly precluded the manufacturer's attempt to allocate fault to the nonparty employer in its amended answer; because the employer was clothed with immunity from liability in tort under the exclusive-remedy provision of the workers'
   compensation statutes, the employer could not have joint or several “liability” in tort and therefore did not meet the definition of “joint tortfeasor” in the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c61s16-61-201" target="_blank">16-61-201</a></cite> et seq., or fall within the confines of that act.

       Where Workers' Compensation insurance company paid benefits and sought subrogation claim against liability carrier, liability carrier was not entitled to assert a claim against employer on the ground that the employer was negligent or assert a claim for contribution or indemnity.

       In absence of a contract for indemnity running in favor of the third party, a negligent third party tortfeasor is not entitled to either indemnity or contribution from a negligent employer where their concurrent negligence has produced the injury or death of the employee.

       A third party will have indemnity from a negligent employer where the liability that has been imposed upon the third party is purely vicarious and without fault on his part. Dulin v. Circle F Indus., Inc., 558 F.2d 456 (8th Cir. 1977).

       Evidence was sufficient to find an implied promise that the employer would indemnify third party for any damages he is made to pay as a result of the employer's negligence. Smith v. Paragould Light & Water Comm'n, 303 Ark. 109, 793 S.W.2d 341 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       There exists an exception to the exclusivity of the workers' compensation remedy when there is a contract or special relation capable of carrying with it an implied obligation to indemnify running from the employer to a third party; however, the exception does not extend to a fully executed sales contract, in which implied duties or warranties do not run from the purchaser (employer) to manufacturer, but from the manufacturer to the purchaser. To find that when a purchaser buys a product, he makes an implied contract with the manufacturer to use that product in such a way as not to bring liability upon the manufacturer would be stretching the concept of contract out of all relation to reality. Mosley Mach. Co. v. Gray Supply Co., 310 Ark. 214, 833 S.W.2d 772 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere acknowledgement of the employer's duty to maintain and operate a machine in a safe manner and to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations does not express an agreement of indemnity running to the manufacturer so as to constitute an exception to the exclusivity of the Workers' Compensation Law. Mosley Mach. Co. v. Gray Supply Co., 310 Ark. 214, 833 S.W.2d 772 (1992).

       When a telephone company worker was injured in an accident involving a delivery driver, the telephone company was not liable to indemnify the delivery company under an implied indemnity exception to the exclusivity of the Workers'

The relevant statutes and safety regulations that the telephone company was said to have violated merely created a duty of safety to the public and the telephone company's employees.

       In order to avoid the bar of this section, complaint must allege intentional or deliberate act by employer with a desire to bring about the consequences of the act and not willful and wanton conduct by negligent direction to the employee to use a device known by the employer to be defective or failure to warn the employee of an unsafe condition of which the employer was aware.

      <p>
       Whenever an employee is injured by the willful and malicious acts of his employer he may treat the acts of the employer as a breach of the employer-employee relationship and seek full damages in a common-law action; however, he must elect one remedy or the other.

      <p>
       Failure to warn of dangers or failure to provide safe conditions, deliberately placing an employee in a dangerous position and willfully violating governmental regulations does not bring the cause of action within the ambit of an intentional tort. That type of activity by an employer, even where flagrant, does not constitute an intentional tort for purposes of the exclusivity provision of this chapter. Miller v.

      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that the intentional infliction of an injury upon an employee by an employer is an exception to the exclusive remedy provision of this chapter, that exception is not created by the bare allegation that the employee's injury was the result of willful and wanton conduct by the employer; in order to escape the application of subsection (a), the complaint must allege a deliberate act by the employer with a desire to bring about the consequences of the act.

       Since an employer is immune from a cause of action based on the negligent failure to provide employees with a safe place to work, the same immunity protects supervisory employees when their general duties involve the overseeing and discharging of that same responsibility.

       Where an employee has alleged two separate injuries, one being a work-related physical injury, for which she has received workers' compensation benefits, and one being a subsequent nonphysical injury arising from employer's action in terminating her based upon her physical disability as a result of the injury, the first injury is exclusively cognizable under the Workers' Compensation Act (see § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-105" target="_self">11-9-105</a></cite>), while the subsequent injury is of the type envisioned by the Arkansas Civil rights Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c123s16-123-101" target="_blank">16-123-101</a></cite> et seq.Davis v.

       Although under this section employer cannot rely on claims of negligence on part of fellow employee, assumption of risk or contributory negligence, the third party tort feasor is not deprived of the common-law defenses. Rhoads v. Service Machine Co., 329 F. Supp. 367 (E.D. Ark. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant supervisor was part-owner of employer corporation, defendants in a wrongful death action could not obtain contribution from him as third party defendant because he, rather than the corporation, was regarded as the employer for the purpose of the exclusive remedy clause of this section. Jack Morgan Constr. Co. v. Larkan, 254 Ark. 838, 496 S.W.2d 431 (1973).

       Where a third party tort action was filed against a company based on the allegation that claimant was a special employee of the company, in granting a writ of prohibition, the Court implicitly held that the special employee issue was to be decided by the Arkansas Workers'

   Compensation Act. Nucor Corp. v. Rhine, 366 Ark. 550, 237 S.W.3d 52 (2006).

       This chapter does not prevent an employee, or his personal representative, from maintaining an action for negligence of a fellow employee. King v. Cardin, 229 Ark. 929, 319 S.W.2d 214 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exclusive jurisdiction to entertain an employee's claim against employer for injuries caused while working as his employee rests in the Workers' Compensation Commission; no exception is made when the injury is caused by a fellow employee. Campbell v. Waggoner, 235 Ark. 374, 360 S.W.2d 124 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before an action for damages may be sustained against an employer for the intentional actions of fellow employees, there must be allegations of willful and intentional acts by the employer or it must be alleged that he directed, authorized, or commanded his other employees to do the wrongful acts and the mere fact that an employer's supervisory employee injures another employee by inflicting an intentional tort is not cause to allow such an action. Sontag v. Orbit Valve Co., 283 Ark. 191, 672 S.W.2d 50 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case regarding a third party's liability (co-employee) for the employee's injury at work, because the co-employee was responsible for transporting the employee to and from a work site, he was involved in the employer's duty of providing the employee a safe place to work; thus, workers' compensation was the employee's exclusive remedy and the trial court did not err when it granted the co-employee's motion for summary judgment. Gafford v. Cox, 84 Ark. App. 57, 129 S.W.3d 296 (2003).

       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's finding that the employee and co-employee were acting within the scope of their employment at the time of a golf outing accident where both were at the golf course for a sales meeting, which included lunch and the continued discussion and free flow of ideas regarding the employer's business while playing golf and having a team dinner with spouses.

       Workers'

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where employer manufactured asbestos products, and such products were used in employer's plants to fireproof ceilings by an outside contractor, the court applied the dual capacity doctrine, so that the Workers' Compensation Act did not bar an employee's product liability suit since the employer owed a separate duty as a manufacturer to the employee. Estate of Blakely v. Asbestos Corp., 766 F. Supp. 721 (E.D. Ark. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the dual persona theory, an employer may become a third person, vulnerable to tort suit, if he possesses a second persona, completely unrelated to his employer status, that could be recognized by legal standards as a seperate legal person. Thomas ex rel. City Nat'l Bank v. Valmac Indus., Inc., 306 Ark. 228, 812 S.W.2d 673 (1991), superseded by statute as stated in, Stanton v. Larry Fowler Trucking, Inc., 52 F.3d 723 (8th Cir. 1995), superseded by statute as stated in, Estate of Donley v. Pace Indus., 336 Ark. 101, 984 S.W.2d 421 (Ark. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff-employee had a third party claim against the tortfeasor at the time of the accident, and the tortfeasor subsequently merged with his employer, an action could be brought against his employer under the dual persona doctrine, in the employer's status as the successor corporation of the tortfeasor. Thomas ex rel. City Nat'l Bank v. Valmac Indus., Inc., 306 Ark. 228, 812 S.W.2d 673 (1991), superseded by statute as stated in, Stanton v.

       After the legislature amended subsection (a) to abrogate the dual-persona exception, it would be unreasonable for the court to expand that doctrine since it was clearly defunct and unequivocally annulled. Estate of Donley v. Pace Indus., 336 Ark. 101, 984 S.W.2d 421 (Ark. 1999).

       An action by an employee against his employer's insurance carrier for underinsured motorist benefits was not an action against the employer and, therefore, was not barred by exclusive-remedy provision of the Workers' Compensation Act.

        Writ of Prohibition.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Employer's petition for a writ of prohibition was granted in a case where summary judgment, based on subsection (a) of this section, was denied in a negligence suit; whether an employer/employee relationship existed was within the jurisdiction of the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission, and there was no other remedy available to the employer because the denial of the motion for summary judgment was not reviewable, even after a trial on the merits. Coonrod v. Seay, 367 Ark. 437, 241 S.W.3d 252 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Writ of prohibition was granted because a circuit court was wholly without jurisdiction to decide whether the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Act applied since there was a conflict over the narrow exception to the exclusivity doctrine; moreover, there was no adequate remedy since a motion for summary judgment was not subject to appeal. A motion to dismiss was treated as such since matters outside of the pleadings were considered.
   Get Rid of It Arkansas, Inc. v. Hughes, 368 Ark. 535, 247 S.W.3d 838 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide the existence of an employer-employee relationship between employers and a deceased worker, for exclusivity purposes, because the Workers'
   Compensation Commission had exclusive jurisdiction to first decide relevant fact questions, since the facts were not so one-sided as to allow such a determination as a matter of law; thus, the employers were entitled to a writ of prohibition.

       A false representation as to a physical condition in procuring employment will preclude the benefits of the Workers' Compensation Act for an otherwise compensable injury if it is shown that the employee knowingly and willfully made a false representation as to his physical condition, the employer relied upon the false representation, and the reliance was a substantial factor in the employment, and there was a casual connection between the false representation and the injury. Shippers Transp. v. Stepp, 265 Ark. 365, 578 S.W.2d 232 (1979); Shock v. Wheeling Pipe Line, 270 Ark. 57, 603 S.W.2d 446 (1980); Roberts-McNutt, Inc. v. Williams, 15 Ark.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section was amended specifically to annul the holding in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Baysinger, 306 Ark. 239, 812 S.W.2d 463 (1991); however, the amendments are only applicable to injuries occurring after July 1, 1993. Pedigo v. P.A.M. Transp., Inc., 891 F. Supp. 482 (W.D. Ark. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrongful discharge claim is not governed by any law other than that in effect at the time it occurred; it was the intent of the General Assembly to abolish the cause of action for wrongful discharge as of July 1, 1993. Tackett v. Crain Automotive, 321 Ark. 36, 899 S.W.2d 839 (1995).

       This section was amended in 1993 in order to preserve the exclusive remedy of the Workers' Compensation Act by eliminating the common-law remedies for retaliatory or wrongful discharge. Davis v. Dillmeier Enters., Inc., 330 Ark. 545, 956 S.W.2d 155 (1997).

       Former employer's claim was not barred by the language of the joint petition filed in the workers' compensation proceeding, wherein she agreed that if her petition for workers' compensation benefits was approved she would have no further claim under the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act of any nature, since her suit in circuit court was not a claim under the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act but a cause of action for retaliatory discharge.

       Where an employee has alleged two separate injuries, one being a work-related physical injury, for which she has received workers' compensation benefits, and one being a subsequent nonphysical injury arising from employer's action in terminating her based upon her physical disability as a result of the injury, the first injury is exclusively cognizable under the Workers' Compensation Act (see § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-105" target="_self">11-9-105</a></cite>), while the subsequent injury is of the type envisioned by the Arkansas Civil rights Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c123s16-123-101" target="_blank">16-123-101</a></cite> et seq.Davis v.

      </p>
      <p>
       There is no remedy under this chapter for an employee who is terminated from his or her job on the basis of a disability after the end of the rehabilitation and compensation period; thus, the exclusive-remedy provision of this chapter does not preclude an employee from bringing an action under the Arkansas Civil Rights Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c123s16-123-101" target="_blank">16-123-101</a></cite> et seq., based upon employer's alleged discrimination in terminating her on the basis of her permanent restrictions and impairments.

      <p>
       Claims of retaliatory discharge which are filed after July 1, 1993, the effective date of Acts 1993, No. 796, are claims made to the Arkansas Worker's Compensation Commission rather than to the courts; this remedy should not be construed as creating an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine. Brown v. Pepsico, Inc., 844 F. Supp. 517 (W.D. Ark. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the finding that the employer did not willfully terminate the claimant where the claimant testified that the owner of the employer told him that he he was no longer needed and that he had been replaced, but (1) the owner stated that he told the claimant to come in the next morning to discuss his work schedule, (2) the bookkeeper in charge of payroll testified that she did not have any documentation that the claimant had been fired and that his case file simply reflected that he had been injured, paid workers' compensation benefits, and had not returned to work when he was released by his doctor, and (3) the claimant' supervisor testified that she had the authority to hire and fire personnel, and that, to her knowledge, the claimant had not been fired. Stiger v. State Line Tire Serv., 72 Ark. App. 250, 35 S.W.3d 335 (2000).

       Appellant partially relied on subsection (a) of this section, but her reliance was misplaced; it is true that the terms of a contract, by themselves, cannot convert an employee into an independent contractor if the other surrounding facts do not support that conclusion, but in this case, the Workers'
   Compensation Commission found that the facts supported appellee's position that appellant was acting as an independent contractor, not an employee, and the court could not say that others could not have reached the same conclusion, such that the court affirmed the denial of benefits.

      <p>
       Trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify payments for parochial school education because the parties'
   agreement on that subject was an independent contract separate from child support; tuition payments in this case did not “support” or “care” for the children where they were in addition to a support payment, and there was no deviation based on the tuition. An independent property-settlement agreement, if approved by a court and incorporated into a divorce decree, cannot be subsequently modified by the court.

       Legislature had a rational and legitimate public purpose for distinguishing between mental and physical workers'
   compensation injuries under subdivision (b)(1) of this section, limiting compensation for mental injuries to 26 weeks, because there was a greater potential for fraudulent claims being advanced for mental injuries, and permitting more extensive benefits for mental injuries would act as a disincentive for workers to devote themselves fully to psychological or psychiatric treatment and recovery. Therefore, subdivision (b)(1) did not violate equal protection under Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 3.

       Because action for emotional distress by wife of injured employee was one manifestly premised on a nonphysical injury, and because her injury was not compensable and beyond the scope of coverage of this chapter, the claim was not barred by the exclusive-remedy provision of this chapter.

       Employee's bipolar disorder was not compensable where there was no testimony as to whether the bipolar diagnosis met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

       Although it would be preferable in cases of mental injury or illness for a psychiatrist or psychologist to correlate the basis of his opinion to the DSM criteria, substantial evidence supported the determination that the claimant's bipolar disorder was a compensable work-related injury where a physician, in both his deposition and progress notes, described the claimant's bipolar disorder in such detail that the Workers' Compensation Commission could easily make the finding that the diagnosis met the DSM-IV criteria.

       Court rejected employee's claim that under subdivision (b)(1) of this section, he was entitled to an additional 26 weeks'

       Where claimant sustained compensable physical injuries, and his primary care physician recommended that he not return to work until he had a psychological evaluation, claimant seeking to determine whether his mental distress was the result of his physical injuries should have been provided with a full psychological evaluation by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist.

      <p>
       Compensation denied where the claimant failed to meet the subdivision (a)(2) requirement of showing that the diagnosis of the condition met the criteria established in the most current issue of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; the burden of proof was a preponderance of the evidence. Branscum v. RNR Constr. Co., 60 Ark. App. 116, 959 S.W.2d 429 (1998).

       Evidence was sufficient to support an award of 26 weeks of disability benefits to the claimant where there was testimony from the claimant, his wife, and two physicians regarding the claimant's problems being around people and functioning in society due to his bipolar disorder. Hope Livestock Auction Co. v. Knighton, 67 Ark. App. 165, 992 S.W.2d 826 (1999).

       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission was correct in affirming the denial of a claimant's request for additional disability benefits for the claimant's mental injury; the claimant failed to show entitlement to compensation by a preponderance of the evidence and the Commission displayed a substantial basis for the denial of the relief requested by the claimant.

      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in denying an employee's request for psychological treatment because there was evidence in the record that a licensed counselor and a neurologist diagnosed the employee with a psychological disorder after she sustained an admittedly compensable injury to her head during the course and scope of her employment, and that diagnosis had been reviewed and approved by both a licensed psychiatrist and a psychologist.

       Logical interpretation of subdivisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section is that if a heart attack is proved to have been caused by the physical or mental stress arising out of the performance of work that is extraordinary and unusual in comparison to the employee's usual work, the heart attack is compensable; but where an employee suffers an on-the-job heart attack in the absence of work that is unusual and extraordinary, or in the absence of the occurrence of some unusual or unpredicted incident, it is not compensable, regardless of the level of physical or mental distress the employee experiences.

       Although the commission has the statutory authority to require that parties specify all the issues to be presented for review, it also has the statutory duty to decide the issues before it on the basis of the record as a whole and to decide the facts de novo.

       The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission is not an appellate court; it is, instead, the fact finder, and as such has a duty and statutory obligation to make specific findings of fact on de novo review based on the record as a whole, and to decide the issues before it by determining whether the party having the burden of proof on an issue has established it by a preponderance of the evidence.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that passage of this Act is necessary to enable the Workers' Compensation Commission to fully discharge the financial obligations of the State of Arkansas by providing additional revenue generating potential within current statutory taxation authority. Further, it is also determined that the only acceptable method for assuring payment of benefits under the workers' compensation law pertaining to death and permanent total disability payments is to change the procedure for assessment and collection of premium and self-insurers' taxes.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the welfare of both employer and employee is of primary interest and concern to the State of Arkansas; that the maximum benefits presently payable under the Workers' Compensation law are inadequate due to the steadily increasing cost of living and should be increased immediately to meet said increase in the cost of living; that certain other provisions should be clarified or modified, and that it is in the best interest of both employers and employees that this be accomplished as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act, being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

     <p>
      Acts 1981, No. 72, § 3: Feb. 16, 1981. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the Worker's Compensation Commission should have the flexibility of establishing the amount of deposit or surety bond to be required in order to satisfy the Commission that a group self-insurer has the ability to meet its liabilities under the Worker's Compensation law; that the present law does not provide such flexibility and that this Act is immediately necessary to so provide. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Many members of existing self-insured groups will be forced to withdraw from such groups unless present law which may be deemed to require certified audited statements is changed.

       Workers' compensation insurance has the salutary purpose of protecting employees, employers, and the public by providing a means by which injured workers may be compensated during the period of their inability to work caused by the injury so that they may continue to exist and feed their families. The public is protected because, hopefully, this prevents injured workers from becoming wards of the state maintained at the expense of the public. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Crist, 664 F. Supp. 1242 (W.D. Ark. 1987), rev'd, 855 F.2d 1326 (8th Cir. Ark. 1988).

       The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act does not specify what extrastate situations it covers. An employer's liability, however, is based upon disability or death from an injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and “employment” is defined as every employment carried on in the state. Therefore, the application of the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act is limited by its terms to harms arising out of employments carried on in Arkansas. Patton v. Brown & Root, Inc., 31 Ark. App. 141, 789 S.W.2d 745 (1990).

       Living assistance services provided by mother to disabled son were held not to be compensable nursing services. Little Rock Convention & Visitors Bureau v. Pack, 60 Ark. App. 82, 959 S.W.2d 415 (1997).

       On appeal, the court will review the evidence in the light most favorable to the findings of the Workers' Compensation Commission and will give the testimony its strongest probative value in favor of the order of the commission.

        Assaults.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In the case of assaults, the general rule is that injuries resulting from an assault are compensable where the assault is casually related to the employment, but such injuries are not compensable when the assault arises out of purely personal reasons. Pigg v. Auto Shack, 27 Ark. App. 42, 766 S.W.2d 36 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where altercation occurred during business hours, on the employer's premises, and as the result of a quarrel having its origin in the employment, the injuries were compensable. Welch's Laundry & Cleaners v. Clark, 38 Ark. App. 223, 832 S.W.2d 283 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       An assault arises out of the employment either if the risk of assault is increased by the nature or setting of the work (regardless of the reason for the assault), or if the reason for the assault was a quarrel having its origin in the work; the test is an alternative one and the satisfaction of either condition will render injuries received as the result of an assault compensable. Bryan v. Best Western/Coachman's Inn, 47 Ark. App. 75, 885 S.W.2d 28 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant, a maintenance worker and security guard, was injured in the course of his employment when he was assaulted by a trespasser who refused to leave the property; because the risk of assault was increased by the nature of the claimant's work, the injury arose out of his employment. Bryan v. Best Western/Coachman's Inn, 47 Ark. App. 75, 885 S.W.2d 28 (1994).

       The term “compensation” as used in this section refers to three kinds of benefits: (1) the money allowance payable for disability; (2) the medical and hospital services and supplies; and (3) funeral expenses. Brooks v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., 247 Ark. 61, 444 S.W.2d 246 (1969).

        Concurrent Benefit Rule.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The “concurrent benefit” rule calls for a liberal construction of the requirements of the statute that requires that the injury resulting in death must arise “out of and in the course of employment.” Robbins v. Jackson, 232 Ark. 658, 339 S.W.2d 417 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       The “concurrent benefit” rule had no application where deceased's death did not occur while he was performing the duties of his employment. Robbins v. Jackson, 232 Ark. 658, 339 S.W.2d 417 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       The “concurrent benefit” rule cannot be applied to circumvent the necessity of a claimant first showing that his injury arose out of and in the course of employment. Robbins v. Jackson, 232 Ark. 658, 339 S.W.2d 417 (1960).

        False Representation.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in granting a workers' compensation award to an employee, even though he falsely represented on his employment application that he had no previous injury, where the employer told the employee to omit any reference to the injury because it would make his insurance go up. Roberts-McNutt, Inc. v. Williams, 288 Ark. 587, 708 S.W.2d 87 (Ark. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The following factors must be present before a false statement in an employment application will bar benefits: (1) the employee must have knowingly and willfully made a false representation as to his physical condition, (2) the employer must have relied upon the false representation and this reliance must have been a substantial factor in the hiring, and (3) there must have been a causal connection between the false representation and the injury. College Club Dairy v. Carr, 25 Ark. App. 215, 756 S.W.2d 128 (1988); James River Corp. v. Walters, 53 Ark. App. 59, 918 S.W.2d 211 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission's finding that employer failed to prove that it relied on false representations made by the employee when it decided to hire him was supported by substantial evidence in that the employment application appeared to have been filled out by someone other than the employee some four months after he was hired. James River Corp. v. Walters, 53 Ark. App. 59, 918 S.W.2d 211 (1996).

      </p>

       When a truly unexplained fall occurs while the employee is on the job and performing the duties of his employment, the injury resulting therefrom is compensable. Moore v. Darling Store Fixtures, 22 Ark. App. 21, 732 S.W.2d 496 (1987).

      <p>
       Injuries suffered by employees, who at the precise moment of the accident are not acting within the course and scope of their employment may be compensated if their temporary departure from the job is not great. Coleman's Bar-B-Que v. Fuller, 262 Ark. 645, 559 S.W.2d 714 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>

Pinegar, 269 Ark. 768, 601 S.W.2d 227 (1980); Moore v. Darling Store Fixtures, 22 Ark. App. 21, 732 S.W.2d 496 (1987); Preway, Inc. v. Davis, 22 Ark. App. 132, 736 S.W.2d 21 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission should follow a liberal approach in determining whether the accident in fact grew out of and occurred in the course of the employment and it is the duty of the commission to draw all legitimate inferences possible in favor of the claimant and to give the claimant the benefit of doubt. Gerber Prods. v. McDonald, 15 Ark. App. 226, 691 S.W.2d 879 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employer's obligation under workers' compensation may extend beyond termination when the activity causing injury is a normal and reasonable incident of the employment relationship. Jones v. City of Imboden, 39 Ark. App. 19, 832 S.W.2d 866 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       An injury may be found to have occurred “in the course of employment” despite the fact that the claimant had been discharged prior to the work-related assault. Jones v. City of Imboden, 39 Ark. App. 19, 832 S.W.2d 866 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “arising out of the employment” refers to the origin or cause of the accident. Tbe phrase “in the course of” the employment refers to the time, place and circumstances under which the injury occurs. Deffenbaugh Indus. v. Angus, 39 Ark.

      <p>
       An accident arises “out of” the employment when there is a causal connection between the two; that is, when the accident results from a risk reasonably incident to the employment. Southland Corp. v. Hester, 253 Ark. 959, 490 S.W.2d 132 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where second injury results from nonwork-related negligent conduct on the part of the claimant which effects an independent intervening cause, no liability can be placed upon the employer; where it occurs within the scope of the employment, the neglect of the claimant leading to his injury is of no consequence. The employer at the time of the injury is liable for all consequences of that injury without regard to the claimant's conduct. Bearden Lumber Co. v. Bond, 7 Ark. App. 65, 644 S.W.2d 321 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that an assault occurs on an employer's parking lot or in close proximity to his place of employment does not establish a causal connection with the employment. Bagwell v. Falcon Jet Corp., 8 Ark. App. 192, 649 S.W.2d 841 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for a worker's disability to be compensable, there must be a causal connection between the accident and a risk which is reasonably incident to the employment. There must be affirmative proof of a distinctive employment risk as the cause of the injury; the connection with the employment cannot be supplied by speculation. Bagwell v. Falcon Jet Corp., 8 Ark. App. 192, 649 S.W.2d 841 (1983); Gerber Prods. v. McDonald, 15 Ark. App. 226, 691 S.W.2d 879 (1985).

       Where it was clear that if it had not been for the stress placed on the employee at his workplace, there would have been no suicide, then there was no independent intervening cause breaking the chain of causation between the stress employee experienced as a result of his employment and his suicide, and the exclusion provided in subdivision (b)(2) did not apply.

       Injuries incurred while traveling to or from work held not to arise out of employment. Dickinson v. Central Constr. Co., 233 Ark. 360, 344 S.W.2d 599 (1961); American Red Cross v. Hogan, 13 Ark. App. 194, 681 S.W.2d 417 (1985).

       The general rule is that injuries which occurred while an employee is going to or from work are not compensable since all persons, including employees, are subject to the recognized hazards of travel to and from work in a vehicle, generally referred to as the “street risk doctrine.” Williams v. National Youth Corps in Sch. Programs, 269 Ark. 649, 600 S.W.2d 27 (Ct. App. 1980).

       Injuries sustained by employees while going to and returning from their regular place of employment are not, as a general rule, deemed to arise out of and in the course of employment. American Red Cross v. Hogan, 13 Ark. App. 194, 681 S.W.2d 417 (1985); Lepard v. West Memphis Mach. & Welding, 51 Ark. App. 53, 908 S.W.2d 666 (1995).

       Although an exception to the going and coming rule may operate to place an employee traveling to or from work within the course of his employment, it does not follow that the employee's injury is therefore compensable, because the employee must still show that the injury arose out of his employment. Woodard v. White Spot Cafe, 30 Ark. App. 221, 785 S.W.2d 54 (1990).

       The exception to the going and coming rule permitting recovery for injuries received by employees traveling between two parts of an employer's premises, such as by way of a public street, was applicable to injury incurred prior to July 1, 1993 (the effective date of the amendment of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol15Biii" target="_self">11-9-102(5)(B)(iii)</a></cite> (now §

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Under the positional risk doctrine, an injury arises out of the employment if it would not have occurred but for the fact that the conditions and obligations of the employment placed claimant in the position where he was injured. The only connection of the employment with the injury is that its obligations placed the employee in a particular place at the particular time when he is injured by some neutral force, “neutral” meaning neither personal to the claimant nor distinctly associated with the employment. Deffenbaugh Indus. v. Angus, 39 Ark. App. 24, 832 S.W.2d 869 (1992), aff'd, 313 Ark. 100, 852 S.W.2d 804 (1993).

      <p>
       A worker required to be on company property 24 hours a day, who was injured by a tornado while on company property eating dinner, was entitled to compensation for that injury, as the tornado constituted a neutral risk. Deffenbaugh Indus. v. Angus, 39 Ark. App. 24, 832 S.W.2d 869 (1992), aff'd, 313 Ark. 100, 852 S.W.2d 804 (1993).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Preexisting disease or infirmity of an employee does not disqualify a claim under the “arising out of employment” requirement if the employment aggravated, accelerated, or combined with the disease or infirmity to produce the death or disability for which compensation is sought. Black v. Riverside Furn. Co., 6 Ark. App. 370, 642 S.W.2d 338 (1982)Criticized byCox v. Nashville Livestock Com., 28 Ark. App. 138, 771 S.W.2d 786 (1989).

       The aggravation of the symptoms of a preexisting heart condition was not compensable. Black v. Riverside Furn. Co., 6 Ark. App. 370, 642 S.W.2d 338 (1982)Criticized byCox v. Nashville Livestock Com., 28 Ark. App. 138, 771 S.W.2d 786 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of workers' compensation benefits will be sustained where heart attack is shown to have been aggravated or precipitated by the employment; there is no requirement that in order for a heart attack to be compensable, it must be caused or brought on by some unusual exertion rather than by the employee's regular work. C.J. Horner Co. v. Stringfellow, 14 Ark. App. 138, 685 S.W.2d 533 (1985), aff'd, 286 Ark. 342, 691 S.W.2d 861 (Ark. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the requirement of a causal connection is not met, the commission did not err in finding employee's psychological disorders not compensable as an aggravation of a preexisting condition. Henson v. Club Prods., 22 Ark. App. 136, 736 S.W.2d 290 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where injuries sustained while working for employer amounted to an aggravation, not a recurrence, of previous injury, employer was liable for the aggravation of the old injury. Hawkins Constr. v. Maxell, 52 Ark. App. 116, 915 S.W.2d 302 (1996), rev'd, 325 Ark. 133, 924 S.W.2d 789 (1996).

       Substantial evidence supported the determination that the claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome was not causally related to her employment where: (1) the claimant's supervisors testified that she worked no more than 30 minutes at a time on a production line; (2) the claimant first noticed a problem with her hands while she was a supervisor; (3) the claimant often played volleyball, racquetball, and walleyball; and (4) the claimant told a company nurse that she might have to stop playing volleyball and racquetball because her hands hurt, but she never told anyone that her injury was work-related.

       The primary purpose is to protect the employees of subcontractors who are not financially responsible, and to prevent employers from relieving themselves from liability by doing through independent contractors what they would otherwise do through direct employees. Liggett Constr. Co. v. Griffin, 4 Ark. App. 247, 629 S.W.2d 316 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is not for the benefit of the subcontractor, but rather for the unprotected subcontractor's employees. The same person can not be both the subcontractor and the injured employee, because to so hold ignores both the purpose of this section and its various provisions. Employers Ins. of Wausau v. Polar Express, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 610 (W.D. Ark. 1991).

       Although an injured worker alleged that a healthcare company was a prime contractor for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, such a finding by the court would have afforded him no relief since he had elected to sue in tort under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-105ol1b" target="_self">11-9-105(b)</a></cite>, and subsection (a), which made a prime contractor liable for compensation to employees of subcontractors who failed to secure compensation, was a workers'

       Commission erred in disregarding the corporate entity of the subcontractor in determining whether a prime contractor should be liable for compensation to an injured employee of the subcontractor. Thomas v. Southside Contractors, 260 Ark. 694, 543 S.W.2d 917 (1976).
      </p>

       Evidence sufficient to find general contractor was liable for benefits to employee of subcontractor. Liggett Constr. Co. v. Griffin, 4 Ark. App. 247, 629 S.W.2d 316 (1982).

       When the subcontractor carries no compensation insurance, the prime contractor is made a statutory employer and has the same immunity as a regular employer. Lewis v. Industrial Heating & Plumbing, 290 Ark. 291, 718 S.W.2d 941 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The liability arising on the part of a prime contractor would not extend to subcontractors under this section, but would be limited to the subcontractor's employees. Estate of Sodorff v. United S. Assurance Co., 980 F. Supp. 1004 (W.D. Ark. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant was an employee of his brother, an uninsured subcontractor of the roofing company, the roofing company was the prime contractor liable for workers'
   compensation benefits to claimant; the fact that claimant's brother may have been an independent contractor for the roofing company did not preclude him from also being a subcontractor of the roofing company for purposes of this section.
   Garcia v. A&M Roofing, 89 Ark. App. 251, 202 S.W.3d 532 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where injured worker was employed by an uninsured subcontractor, appellant contractor, as the “prime contractor”, was ordered to pay workers' compensation benefits to the worker; substantial evidence supported the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission's finding that the necessary links existed between the work the injured worker was performing and the contract with the Arkansas State Highway Commission in that all subcontractors were performing services that arose from this contract and the contractor was the only one with an obligation to a third party. Jones Bros. v. Journagan Constr. Co., 92 Ark. App. 406, 214 S.W.3d 870 (2005), modified, Jones Bros., Inc. v. Whitlock, 366 Ark. 254, 234 S.W.3d 864 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Stipulations and testimony, particularly the fact that general contractor had subcontracted the roofing on a house to a roofing subcontractor, along with the court's interpretation of the terms “prime contractor” and “general contractor,” constituted substantial evidence that the general contractor was the prime contractor and, thus, was statutorily liable for the subcontractor's employee's injuries. Musson Custom Bldg., Inc. v. Valladares, 93 Ark. App. 490, 222 S.W.3d 214 (2006).

      <p>
       Before an independent contractor can be found a “subcontractor” within the meaning of this section, it must first be established that the one sought to be held liable as “prime contractor” was contractually obligated to a third person for the work being performed by the independent contractor. Bailey v. Simmons, 6 Ark. App. 193, 639 S.W.2d 526 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the evidence showed that owners of property upon which a house was being built were not contractually bound to any third person in connection with the work being done by the independent contractor and his injured employee, and that the owners exercised no control over either of them, the owners of the property could not be held liable as the prime contractors. Bailey v. Simmons, 6 Ark. App. 193, 639 S.W.2d 526 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The duties of a general contractor to a subcontractor's employees are analogous to those of an owner of the premises, and include the duty to exercise ordinary care, the duty to warn of unusually hazardous conditions that might affect the welfare of the subcontractor's employees, and if the general contractor begins to perform certain duties or activities and then negligently fails to perform or performs in a negligent manner, he may also be held liable. Franklin v. Osca, Inc., 308 Ark. 409, 825 S.W.2d 812 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A general contractor's liability can be likened to the “business invitee” concept: when a general contractor invites a subcontractor onto a job site, the general contractor has a duty to exercise ordinary care for the welfare of the subcontractor's employees. Franklin v. Osca, Inc., 308 Ark. 409, 825 S.W.2d 812 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the citizens of the northeast portion of county assessed a tax against themselves in order to secure dependable emergency ambulance service, and the county only served as a conduit to collect the tax and turn it over to the service on an as-needed basis, the subcontractor-prime contractor provision of subsection (a) was not applicable. Sloan v. Voluntary Ambulance Serv., 37 Ark. App. 138, 826 S.W.2d 296 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contractor was liable for workers' compensation benefits to claimant, as an employee of an uninsured subcontractor, where the contractor subcontracted out a roofing job, and that subcontractor contracted out the job to another roofer, who employed the claimant. Garcia v. A&M Roofing, 89 Ark. App. 251, 202 S.W.3d 532 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in holding that an employer, a registered carrier, was a transportation broker's uninsured subcontractor and that the broker was an injured employee's statutory employer under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-402ol1a" target="_self">11-9-402(a)</a></cite> where the broker was not obligated to transport any loads for a shipper; hence, it had no work to “farm out” to the employer.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The legislature has created the relationship of employer and employee between the employee of a subcontractor who has not secured compensation and the prime contractor; however, this statutory relationship does not exist when the employee has received compensation from the subcontractor and he may proceed against the prime contractor on a common law action of tort as against a third party. Baldwin Co. v. Maner, 224 Ark. 348, 273 S.W.2d 28 (1954), superseded by statute as stated in, Stapleton v. M.D. Limbaugh Constr. Co., 333 Ark. 381, 969 S.W.2d 648 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Workers' Compensation Law of Arkansas, the prime contractor is not the employer of an employee of a subcontractor and becomes the statutory employer liable for compensation only when the subcontractor has failed to provide workers' compensation insurance. Carter v. Fraser Constr. Co., 219 F. Supp. 650 (W.D. Ark. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a claimant was an employee of a subcontractor was a question of fact to be determined by the Workers' Compensation Commission, and that finding on appeal would be given the same effect as the verdict of a jury. Benefield Real Estate v. Mitchell, 269 Ark. 607, 599 S.W.2d 445 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported commission's finding that claimant was an employee of subcontractor and was entitled to benefits. Benefield Real Estate v. Mitchell, 269 Ark. 607, 599 S.W.2d 445 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The determination of whether, at the time of injury, a person was an employee or an independent contractor is a factual one and the Workers' Compensation Commission is required to follow a liberal approach, resolving doubts in favor of employment status for the worker and a reviewing court will view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commission's decision. D & M Constr. Co. v. Archer, 14 Ark. App. 198, 686 S.W.2d 799 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission found that Arkansas Forestry Commission (AFC) was not obligated to a third-party for the business's proper completion of a state contract and, thus, the AFC was not a prime contractor; the Commission found that the business was a contractor to the AFC, but the AFC was a contractor to no one. Riddell Flying Serv. v. Callahan, 90 Ark. App. 388, 206 S.W.3d 284 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that the truck driver had obtained a certificate of non-coverage under this section did not preclude the Arkansas Workers Compensation Commission from concluding that the driver was an employee of the company for purposes of determining entitlement to workers' compensation benefits; the Commission based its conclusion of an employment relationship upon the incidents of control exerted by the company, including ownership and maintenance of the truck and the ability to order the employee to a pick-up location at any time. Cloverleaf Express v. Fouts, 91 Ark. App. 4, 207 S.W.3d 576 (2005).

   Compensation Commission's decision that a claimant's relationship with a contractor was that of an independent contractor because that was the relationship both parties agreed to before the work began and, as such, the contractor was not liable for the claimant's injuries, pursuant to subdivision (c)(1)(A) of this section; the claimant acknowledged his intent in the beginning of the work relationship with the contractor was that no taxes would be withheld from his pay and the claimant would not be covered by workers'
   compensation insurance.

       In an action by carrier of workers' compensation insurance of a prime contractor against a subcontractor to recover amounts paid to an injured employee of the subcontractor, the carrier may be barred by estoppel where insurance premium has been paid or it was carrier's fault that it had not been paid.

       Agreement executed after workers' compensation policy to the effect that policy would cover all employees, including employees of any contractor or subcontractor engaged by insured, who had not provided for compensation coverage of their operations, related back to the effective date of the policy and covered employees of contractor as effectively as if specifically mentioned therein.

      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of certification of noncoverage, a subcontractor who is a sole proprietor or partner but does not insure himself is not necessarily statutorily deemed an employee and the prime contractor is not necessarily liable for his workers' compensation coverage; instead, it is necessary to determine whether such individual is a subcontractor, independent contractor, or, depending upon the right of control, an agent of the prime contractor that should be treated as an employee under the workers' compensation statutes.

       The statutory right of the carrier to recover from the subcontractor is not dependent upon the right of the prime contractor, but rather depends only upon the payment of the claim by the carrier, whose claim for recovery does not affect its liability to the injured employee.

      <p>
       Subsection (a) of this section refers to the prime contractor's liability to employees of the uninsured subcontractor, and subdivision (b)(1) refers to recovery from the subcontractor; thus, it was error to order recovery from a third party in the chain of hiring for a road project, instead of an uninsured subcontractor.

       Although this section is to be strictly construed to the end that employees will not be left without the protection of insurance coverage this rule should not be carried beyond the reason for its existence.

        Cancellation.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section contains two substantive requirements for cancellation of insurance policy — that notice be given and that other insurance be procured. Saint Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Central Sur. & Ins. Corp., 234 Ark. 160, 350 S.W.2d 685 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancellation of policy took effect when formal notice to the commission was given, where notice was given after procurement of other policy. Saint Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Central Sur. & Ins. Corp., 234 Ark. 160, 350 S.W.2d 685 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Policy was in force until the commission approved the cancellation. Traders & Gen. Ins. Co. v. Henderson, 235 Ark. 896, 362 S.W.2d 671 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) of this section requires that one of two conditions precede an effective cancellation when due to nonpayment of premiums — that notice of cancellation be given to both the employer and the Workers' Compensation Commission, or that other insurance be procured within the notice period. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Southwestern Imp., Inc., 19 Ark. App. 239, 719 S.W.2d 708 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The notice of cancellation requirements of subsection (b) of this section are to be strictly construed and applied. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Southwestern Imp., Inc., 19 Ark. App. 239, 719 S.W.2d 708 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The notice sent the employer was ineffective to cancel the insurance policy where the insurer failed also to give notice to the Workers' Compensation Commission pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Southwestern Imp., Inc., 19 Ark. App. 239, 719 S.W.2d 708 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides that notice of any cancellation should be sent to “the commission and to the employer”; the statute does not mention that any employee is to receive notice of the cancellation. Roy Horton Tomato Co. v. Home Ins. Co., 683 F. Supp. 714 (E.D. Ark. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee does not have a cause of action against a workers' compensation carrier for fraudulent cancellation of a policy. Roy Horton Tomato Co. v. Home Ins. Co., 683 F. Supp. 714 (E.D. Ark. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the insurance company properly cancelled the policy; a reasonable jury could have determined that January 15, 2006, was the effective cancellation date (as the notice of cancellation stated) because the notice was mailed more than 10 days earlier, as required by subdivision (b)(2)(B) of this section.

       An employer who conducts two wholly separate and distinct kinds of businesses can become a subscriber for workers' compensation as to one business without insuring his employees in the other business, but he cannot insure part of his employees of one business and not insure the remainder of his employees of that business. Hobbs-Western Co. v. Morris, 212 Ark. 105, 204 S.W.2d 889 (1947) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it was clear that the intention of the parties as to insurance coverage prior to renewal was to cover the partners, but the renewal policy issued did not include the members of the partnership, deceased partner's administratrix was entitled to have the policy reformed to include him. American Cas. Co. v. Hambleton, 233 Ark. 942, 349 S.W.2d 664 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of subsection (c) is deliberately broad and is intended to cover the employer's “entire liability” to his employees where the employer has taken out a workers' compensation insurance policy. Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co. v. Tuggle, 270 Ark. 106, 603 S.W.2d 452 (1980); Arkansas Kraft Vendors v. Horton, 15 Ark. App. 123, 690 S.W.2d 370 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence existed in the record to support commission's finding that employer had a policy of workers' compensation in effect at the time of claimant's injury which covered claimant. Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co. v. Tuggle, 270 Ark. 106, 603 S.W.2d 452 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Policy which was ambiguous as to who it covered would not be construed to provide coverage for injured employee. Arkansas Kraft Vendors v. Horton, 15 Ark. App. 123, 690 S.W.2d 370 (1985).
      </p>

       This chapter does not give or create a cause of action against a third party causing a compensable injury to the employee but only makes it plain that the common law remedy as the employee already had against tortfeasors prior to the enactment of the chapter was fully preserved and left unchanged when the tortfeasor is other than the employer.

       This section provides that, even though an employee draws worker's compensation benefits, he is not precluded from making a separate claim or maintaining a separate cause of action against a third party causing the injuries.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides two methods for pursuing a third-party claim or cause of action: the employee may pursue the claim and make a recovery or, if he chooses not to do so, the employer or carrier may do so. In either event, the employee is to receive at least one third of the amount received, calculated after payment of costs of collection, and the employer or carrier, if there is enough remaining, is to be reimbursed for the workers' compensation benefits paid. Simpson v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 816 F. Supp. 1348 (W.D. Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section creates one cause of action, but two separate claims, one belonging to the employee and the other belonging to the employer or insurance carrier for the employer. Simpson v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 816 F. Supp. 1348 (W.D. Ark. 1993).

       Employee who had received workers' compensation benefits in another state was not precluded against third party responsible for accident in Arkansas even though the other state's workers' compensation law provided that employee would be conclusively presumed to have elected to accept its provisions unless prior to the accident he had filed with compensation commission a written notice that he elected to reject the other state's law.

      <p>
       Workers' Compensation Commission and trial court erred in refusing to consider claim on ground that the accident happened in another state and that state's law was controlling as to allowance of benefits, as recovery in tort from third party for such injury does not bar recovery of workers' compensation in Arkansas, although law of other state forbids such recovery.

       Subdivision (a)(2)(A) does not require a compensation carrier in all instances to participate in the payment of reasonable costs of collection of a personal injury claim, including attorney's fees; rather, this section provides only that reasonable costs of collection shall first be deducted from the gross amount received, before the net amount is allocated between the claimant and subrogee. The statute clearly does not provide for splitting of the gross sum in order to make a pro rata allocation of the costs of collection from both the claimant and the insurance carrier.

       In a suit by an employee against a third-party tortfeasor, the employee's attorney's fees are to be deducted from the total recovered before an employer's insurer recovers for past and future workers' compensation payments, even though the insurer admitted liability where there is a contested case. Boulden v. Herring, 126 F. Supp. 885 (W.D. Ark. 1954), aff'd, 227 F.2d 303 (8th Cir. Ark. 1955).

      <p>
       Attorney for administrator of deceased worker, where successful in suit against third-party tortfeasor, was not only entitled to contingent fee on the one-third share of administrator but on the two-thirds share of the compensation carrier who intervened in action in order to claim its statutory share of proceeds as reimbursement of death benefits paid. Winfrey & Carlile v. Nickles, 223 Ark. 894, 270 S.W.2d 923 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contingent fee contract between administrator of deceased worker's estate and attorney hired by him to bring wrongful death action was not binding upon compensation carrier who had intervened to claim share of recovery as reimbursement for death benefits paid. Winfrey & Carlile v. Nickles, 223 Ark. 894, 270 S.W.2d 923 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is for the court and not the commission to determine reasonable compensation for legal services performed in suit against third-party tortfeasor although court, by agreement of parties, referred question of distribution of recovered funds to commission for determination. Winfrey & Carlile v. Nickles, 223 Ark. 894, 270 S.W.2d 923 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action against third-party tortfeasor, beneficiary would be required to pay his attorney out of his share of the recovery in accordance with his contract with the attorney and subrogated insurance carrier would be required to pay its attorneys out of their share of the recovery in accordance with its contract. Saint Paul-Mercury Indem. Co. v. Lanza, 131 F. Supp. 684 (W.D. Ark. 1955), aff'd, 232 F.2d 747 (8th Cir. Ark. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney's fees are not part of the “costs of collection” which are to be deducted before beneficiary's share of recovery against third-party tortfeasor is paid over. Saint Paul-Mercury Indem. Co. v. Lanza, 131 F. Supp. 684 (W.D. Ark. 1955), aff'd, 232 F.2d 747 (8th Cir. Ark. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action against third-party tortfeasor, beneficiary had no power to reject services of attorneys of insurance carrier who was subrogated to rights of beneficiary to the extent of benefits paid by the carrier and fees of the attorneys were not deductible from beneficiary's portion of recovery in absence of express or implied contract between the attorneys and beneficiary. Saint Paul-Mercury Indem. Co. v. Lanza, 131 F. Supp. 684 (W.D. Ark. 1955), aff'd, 232 F.2d 747 (8th Cir. Ark. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employee and third party effected voluntary settlement without trial of claim arising out of injury to employee occasioned by act of third party, Workers' Compensation Commission had the right to approve allowance of employee's attorney's fee and other reasonable costs of collection. Maxcy v. John F. Beasley Constr. Co., 228 Ark. 253, 306 S.W.2d 849 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee was entitled to have the fee of his attorney deducted from the recovery as expense of collection before computing the carrier's lien on two-thirds of the recovery. Phillips v. Morton Frozen Foods, 313 F. Supp. 228 (E.D. Ark. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employer employed its own attorney to pursue the estate of the third-party tortfeasor, the trial court did not commit error in refusing to allow attorney fees for the employee's attorney as costs of collection of the third-party claim under this section; the court should simply apportion the recovery, leaving each to pay his or her own attorney. Orintas v. Meadows, 17 Ark. App. 214, 706 S.W.2d 199 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because attorney's contingency fee and costs were initially deducted from the full amount of the third-party judgment before either the injured employee or the workers' compensation insurance carrier were distributed their respective statutory awards under subdivision (a)(2), the insurance carrier effectively paid its proportionate share of attorney's fees in the employee's third-party action, and no additional attorney's fee was provided by law. Continental Cas. Co. v. Sharp, 312 Ark. 286, 849 S.W.2d 481 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not the cost of collection includes the fee for the employee's attorney on the entire settlement or recovery must be judged on the facts of each case and depends on whether or not the workers' compensation carrier has reached an agreement with the employee's attorney to represent its interest in the third-party action, whether the carrier has had its own attorney participate in the third-party action, or whether the carrier has sat back and allowed the employee's attorney to do all the work and either settle the case or proceed to trial, waiting until a sum is recovered by the employee's attorney before stepping in to take its subrogation amount without any compensation to the attorney responsible for the recovery.

       This section does not really give the employer or carrier two-thirds of the total net proceeds recovered; instead, it only gives them what they have paid, but under no circumstances shall they receive more than two-thirds of the net recovery irrespective of whether that fully reimburses them or not.

       Although the employee may “settle around” the insurance carrier by splitting off and putatively settling only his cause of action, he may not settle and get paid for both of the claims without expecting to reimburse the carrier for the portion of the settlement belonging to it. Simpson v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 816 F. Supp. 1348 (W.D. Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant failed to institute judicial proceedings prior to entering a settlement agreement with a third party, respondent compensation carrier was denied their statutory right to reasonable notice and an opportunity to intervene in an action in court and was, therefore, entitled to credit to the extent of the lien provided for in subdivision (a)(1). Wentworth v. Sparks Regional Medical Ctr., 58 Ark. App. 242, 950 S.W.2d 221 (1997).
      </p>

       Employer was not entitled to a lien or credit for the amounts it paid or would have to pay due to the claimant's injury that occurred within his scope of employment and involved the third party; claimant was not “make whole” by the settlement with the third party as is required before a lien or credit will be permitted.

       Neither the employer nor its insurance carrier is admitting liability when it intervenes in a third-party action under this section. By intervening, they are merely preserving their right to a lien of two-thirds of the proceeds paid to the employee-claimant as a credit against their compensation exposure. Jackson Cookie Co. v.

       Employer had an unconditional right to intervene in its injured employees' suit against a company the employees were working for as independent contractors, and it was error for the trial court to have denied the employer that right where the right to intervene to protect subrogation rights did not require the default judgment against the employer to have been set aside; however, although subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section entitled the employer to reasonable notice to join in the action to protect only its subrogation right, it did not entitle the employer to reasonable notice to join in the action to protect its interest under the indemnification and hold harmless agreement.

       In a suit by an employee against a third-party tortfeasor, where the employee's attorney obtained a settlement by the use of the federal pretrial rules with a judgment to bind the settlement, the reasonableness of the settlement and the attorney fees should have been determined by the federal trial court judge rather than the commission.

       The purpose of subsection (c) is to permit the adjustment of controversies between the employee and employer and to require that settlements between them have the approval of either the court or the Workers' Compensation Commission to prevent an employee from compromising his claims through his tort action in a manner that would not be permitted under this chapter as by way of joint petition.

       An employee and a third party tortfeasor may settle the employee's claim and putatively leave the workers' compensation carrier to pursue its claim separately if it desires, at least so long as the settlement is made prior to judgment; to do so does not violate the rule against splitting of causes of action because the third party for whose benefit the rule was designed has agreed to it.

       The district court did not abuse its discretion when it approved the settlement between the employee and the corporation and denied the employer's motion for reconsideration because the Arkansas judicial doctrine under which the injured employee and the third party tortfeasor could settle around the employer's statutory lien provided that its subrogation rights were preserved was not undercut by the statutory amendments to the workers' compensation statute, and application of the settle around doctrine did not mean double recovery, prevent cooperation among the parties, or conflict with statutory policies.

       Appropriate method of calculating compensation carrier's subrogation award was to deduct from gross settlement proceeds the cost of collection, and then to deduct from remainder any payment by tortfeasor's insurer of otherwise compensable medical expenses paid as part of settlement; figure thus obtained constitutes net proceeds of settlement and subrogation award should have been two-thirds of this amount. Washington County v. Ford, 21 Ark. App. 206, 730 S.W.2d 515 (1987).

       Workers' compensation insurance carrier was not entitled to a subrogation lien against the settlement proceeds generated by a settlement between the injured employee and the doctor who inflicted nerve damage on the injured employee during surgery for a work-related injury as subrogation was only allowed where the settlement made the injured employee whole and the evidence showed that the settlement did not make the injured employee whole.

      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing an insurer to assert its right to a lien against the tortfeasor as well as its insured served to further the intent of this section given that the insurer was denied its statutory right to either participate in an action against the tortfeasor brought by the insured or have notice of the settlement and an opportunity to be heard; the trial court was incorrect in finding that a release signed by the insured operated to bar any claims by the insurer against the tortfeasor, and it was immaterial that the insurer failed to give notice of its claim to the tortfeasor's insurance company.

       Federal district court's application of a Arkansas Supreme Court decision, which applied the made-whole doctrine to the statutory subrogation lien in subdivision (b)(1) of this section, was appropriate and imperative given the rule that, in diversity cases, federal courts must follow state law as announced by the highest court in the state.

       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission did not err in finding that employee had not been made whole by a $ 25,000 settlement from a tortfeasor in a car accident that resulted in a compensable injury based on the fact that some of the settlement reflected an award for pain and suffering and the amount of wage loss suffered; therefore, an employer and its insurer were not entitled to subrogation. Logan County v. McDonald, 90 Ark. App. 409, 206 S.W.3d 258 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court reversed the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission's decision that an employer and the workers' compensation carrier were entitled to subrogation as the damages that employee received in a third party lawsuit after his attorney fees were paid were less than the actual jury verdict; thus, the employee had not been made whole.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The term “third party” as used in this section can only mean a person or entity other than the first and second parties involved, and the first and second parties mean the injured employee and the employer or one liable under the section. Neal v. Oliver, 246 Ark. 377, 438 S.W.2d 313 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       President and owner of corporation was the employer and was not “third party” under this section so as to permit tort suit against him at common law. Neal v. Oliver, 246 Ark. 377, 438 S.W.2d 313 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provisions regarding “third party liability” to an injured worker show intent of General Assembly was to preclude insurer from independent liability. Burkett v. PPG Indus., Inc., 294 Ark. 50, 740 S.W.2d 621 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       A working partner does not become a fellow employee, subject to third-party liability pursuant to this section, because of active involvement in the operations of the business. Hill v. Patterson, 313 Ark. 322, 855 S.W.2d 297 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Insurance carrier was not entitled to bring a contract action against special employer under this section because this section only provides for a carrier liable for compensation to maintain an action in tort, not contract, and then only against a third party, not an employer. National Union Fire Ins. v. Tri-State Iron & Metal, 323 Ark. 258, 914 S.W.2d 301 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A non-supervisory coemployee is not a “third party” within the meaning of subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section. Brown v. Finney, 326 Ark. 691, 932 S.W.2d 769 (1996).

       Insurer and safety consultant were not immune under the exclusive remedy provision of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-105" target="_self">11-9-105</a></cite> because they were “third parties” as defined by this section. Wilson v. Rebsamen Ins., Inc., 330 Ark. 687, 957 S.W.2d 678 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellees were third parties under the Workers' Compensation Act and, thus, employee had a right to maintain an action against them in court despite the fact that he had already pursued a compensation claim against his employer; under subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section, employee's pursuit of a claim for compensation against his or her employer does not effect employee's right to maintain an action in court against a third-party tortfeasor, and employee was not required to make a choice between enforcing his rights under the workers' compensation laws and his constitutional right to a jury trial against the third-party tortfeasor. Craven v. Fulton Sanitation Serv., 361 Ark. 390, 206 S.W.3d 842 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was substantial evidence to support a finding that claimant was not a special employee of the company because, although the company's work was being performed when an injury was suffered, there was no contract for hire with the company and the employer was the one controlling the details of claimant's work. Nucor Corp. v. Rhine, 366 Ark. 550, 237 S.W.3d 52 (2006).

       An action by an employee against his employer's insurance carrier for underinsured motorist benefits was not barred by this section. Elam v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 344 Ark. 555, 42 S.W.3d 443 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court denied summary judgment to the insurer of an employer in an employee's action for underinsured motorists benefits because the employee's settlement of the subrogation claim for less than would have been paid based on the amount paid by the tortfeasor was not an admission that the employee had been made whole and in no way waived her right to underinsured benefits or was inconsistent with her position that she had not been made whole, and there were disputed facts over whether the employee had been made whole under this section as there was no record evidence reflecting her damages.

       As a general rule, there is ordinarily no reduction of compensation benefits because of payments made from private pensions or health and accident insurance, whether provided by the employer, union, or the claimant himself; however, the employer may be entitled to a setoff where the employer clearly establishes that (1) the claimant has received payments from insurance provided by the employer; and (2) sums paid to the injured employee were intended as advance payments of compensation. Riverside Furn. Co. v. Loyd, 42 Ark. App. 1, 852 S.W.2d 147 (1993), superseded by statute as stated in, Dooley v. Automated Conveyor Sys., 84 Ark. App. 412, 143 S.W.3d 585 (2004).

       As the 2009 statutory amendment to subsection (a) of this section dealt with the substance of a firefighter's entitlement to retirement disability benefits, the statute was substantive and could not be applied retroactively to cover the firefighter's injury; consequently, the city was entitled to an offset against his retirement disability benefits.

   compensation disability.

       Statutes limiting recovery for permanent total disability resulting from a second injury while working for the same employer, but leaving open-ended the recovery for permanent total disability from a single injury, are not unconstitutional as an unreasonable classification, since the purpose is to encourage employers to retain injured employees.

       Where the degree of permanent partial disability was of a percentage that would cause the percentage of his wages to be less than the minimum compensation, it was proper for the commission to order payment of the minimum for the total number of weeks allowed. Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. v. Maxey, 212 Ark. 161, 205 S.W.2d 29 (1947) (decision under prior law) Metro Temporaries v. Boyd, 314 Ark. 479, 863 S.W.2d 316 (Ark. 1993).

       Where board awarded specific compensation for permanent injury, employee was entitled to payment of that amount even though employer had previously paid him more than the amount. Lion Oil Co. v. Reeves, 221 Ark. 5, 254 S.W.2d 450 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       The minimum is not to be applied inflexibly in every case or demonstrable inequalities will occur, so, in no case is the amount to exceed the amount of average weekly contributions to the support of his parents by the deceased employee, even though this amount is less than the minimum. Vines v. Arkansas Kraft Corp., 247 Ark. 573, 446 S.W.2d 669 (1969).

       Workers' Compensation Commission had authority to reduce the amount of award for a compensable injury without resorting to expert testimony that claimant's doctor's bill was excessive in precisely that amount. Hulvey v. Kellwood Co., 262 Ark. 564, 559 S.W.2d 153 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant suffered a compensable injury, received medical treatment, returned to his regular job and continued to work until he became totally disabled several years later, claimant is entitled to the maximum weekly benefit rate in effect at the time the disability occurred, and this rate is based on the wages being earned on the date of the accident.

       Loss of the use of the body as a whole involves two factors, the first is the functional or anatomical loss and that percentage is fixed by medical evidence, secondly, there is the wage-loss factor, that is, the degree to which the injury has affected claimant's ability to earn a livelihood; this second element is to be determined by the commission, based on medical evidence, age, education, experience, and other matters reasonably expected to affect the earning power.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section makes no mention of reinstating the seven-day waiting period after a recurrence of disability. Since a recurrence is not a new injury but simply another period of incapacitation resulting from a previous injury, under the language of this section the waiting period applies only to the first seven days' disability from injury. Pinkston v. General Tire & Rubber Co., 30 Ark. App. 46, 782 S.W.2d 375 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       When one receives a serious injury, for which he is disabled longer than the seven-day waiting period, and recovers adequately enough to return to work, but subsequently suffers a recurrence of his disability from the original compensable injury, imposing an additional waiting period would only penalize the injured employee, and would be contrary to the requirement that the workers' compensation act be liberally construed in favor of the claimant. Pinkston v. General Tire & Rubber Co., 30 Ark. App. 46, 782 S.W.2d 375 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant sustained an accidental injury while at work, was off work for a period of six days, returned to work, continued having problems until her doctor advised that she be taken off work due to her initial injury and did not return to work again for three weeks because recurrence resulted in disability that extended beyond the required two-week period, claimant met her waiting period requirement and was entitled to compensation for all wage-loss disability suffered. Hodges v. Baptist Medical Sys., 31 Ark. App. 200, 790 S.W.2d 922 (1990).

       Insurance carrier was entitled to credit for payments made toward a twenty-nine percent permanent-anatomical-impairment rating against its $75,000 maximum liability for permanent-total-disability benefits as the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission effectively adopted December 10 as the date that payments for temporary-total-disability benefits ended and permanent disability payments began; all payments made after December 10, 2002, were classified by the Commission as permanent-total-disability payments that could be applied towards the $75,000 maximum.

       The limit on an employer or carrier's liability under this section applies only to weekly benefits; the employer or carrier is still responsible for any benefits in addition to weekly compensation to which the claimant is entitled. It is therefore not inconsistent with the limitations on liability found in this section to require the employer or carrier to pay the lump sum benefit under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-527ol1d1" target="_self">11-9-527(d)(1)</a></cite>.

       Because the limit on an employer's or insurance carrier's liability in subsection (b) of this section applied only to weekly benefits, they were responsible for the remarriage benefit described in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-527ol1d1" target="_self">11-9-527(d)(1)</a></cite>, even after the $75,000 cap was reached.

       Subsection (b) does not require that each dependent must draw the limit in weekly funds before becoming eligible to draw from the fund. Hill v. CGR Medical Corp., 282 Ark. 35, 665 S.W.2d 274 (Ark. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision of subsection (b) that the liability of the fund arises only after the limit of weekly benefits has been paid by the carrier and received by the dependents prevents acceleration of the date of liability for the fund because the credit for payments of compensation in advance can only be allowed in the weekly amounts as they fall due.

       Where the initial obligation of the carrier had been discharged in part by payment of weekly benefits and the balance by waiving its right as subrogee to participate in a recovery from a third-party tortfeasor in consideration for not being required to pay future weekly benefits to the widow and dependents of a deceased worker, the fund would become liable on the date the carrier's limitation would have been discharged had there been no settlement.

       Claimant's contention that further litigation was not precluded regarding his healing period held without merit where the requirements of collateral estoppel were satisfied; the determination of the end of the healing period was essential to the judgment because the issue in the prior litigation was whether the claimant was permanently and totally disabled, and a finding of permanent impairment necessarily entailed a determination of the end of the healing period.

       The claim for additional compensation should not be treated as so wholly distinct from other claims for additional compensation as to be exempted from the rule that a claim for additional compensation is not barred if filed while compensation is actually being paid; accordingly, claim for additional compensation filed after the original injury was not barred where compensation had been paid continuously from the beginning.

       The plain language of subdivision (a)(1) provides benefits in addition to those workers' compensation benefits already being received by a claimant; the combination of compensation benefits and additional benefits are designed to pay the employee a total amount equal to his or her average salary, thus making the employee whole. Davis v. Dillmeier Enters., Inc., 330 Ark. 545, 956 S.W.2d 155 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative intent and language of subdivision (a)(1) of this section does not allow an employer to implement a 90-day, light-duty policy to circumvent statutory obligations designed to extend for a year. Allen v. Int'l Paper Co., 89 Ark. App. 266, 202 S.W.3d 13 (2005).

       This section does not apply to a claimant released from treatment and consequently no longer receiving any compensation benefits for her injury. Davis v. Dillmeier Enters., Inc., 330 Ark. 545, 956 S.W.2d 155 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing requirement in subdivision (b)(4) does not mean that every claimant must formally file for rehabilitation with the Commission or waive entitlement to disability benefits. Second Injury Fund v. Furman, 60 Ark. App. 237, 961 S.W.2d 787 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The claimant was entitled to mileage costs for commuting to and from a university, notwithstanding a written rehabilitation agreement which expressly excluded such costs, since this section makes the reimbursement of reasonable travel expenses mandatory and since § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-108" target="_self">11-9-108</a></cite> invalidated the parties' written agreement. Air Compressor Equip. Co. v. Sword, 69 Ark. App. 162, 11 S.W.3d 1 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before this section can apply, an employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that he sustained a compensable injury, (2) that suitable employment which is within his physical and mental limitations is available with the employer, (3) that the employer has refused to return him to work, and (4) that the employer's refusal to return him to work is without reasonable cause. Roark v. Pocahontas Nursing & Rehab., 95 Ark. App. 176, 235 S.W.3d 527 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly awarded an employee benefits under subsection (a) of this section even though she was no longer receiving worker's compensation benefits; an award of workers' compensation disability benefits is not a statutory prerequisite to an award of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-505ol1a" target="_self">11-9-505(a)</a></cite> benefits.

       Award of the costs of a rehabilitation program against employer held reasonable. Owens Country Sausage v. Crane, 268 Ark. 732, 594 S.W.2d 872 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a workers' compensation claimant was not entitled to permanent disability benefits following injury, he was not entitled to the costs of a vocational rehabilitation program at his employer's expense under this section. Tibbs v. Dixie Bearings, Inc., 9 Ark. App. 150, 654 S.W.2d 588 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not require that permanent disability benefits be awarded a claimant before he can have vocational rehabilitation but only that he be entitled to receive compensation benefits for a permanent disability. Hampton & Crain v. Black, 34 Ark. App. 77, 806 S.W.2d 21 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported Workers' Compensation Commission's finding that employee met the requirements for benefits as the employee had a compensable injury, the employer did not deny that it had suitable employment within the employee's physical and mental limitations, nor did the employer deny that it refused to return the employee to work. Congo Stove, Fireplace & Patio, Inc. v. Rickenbacker, 77 Ark. App. 346, 74 S.W.3d 238 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported the workers' compensation benefits awarded under this section, because the claimant returned to work immediately following his injury and continued to work for over a year before the employer fired him, and the claimant could not acquire a release to return to work since he had never been taken off work by any physician; the claimant was entitled to reasonable and necessary treatment for his ongoing back pain, and the employer had unreasonably refused to return the claimant to work when the employer had work available within his abilities.
   Nestle, USA, Inc. v. Drone, 2009 Ark. App. 311, 307 S.W.3d 54 (2009), review denied, — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Ark. LEXIS 562 (Sept. 10, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly awarded an employee benefits under subsection (a) of this section even though the employer had told the employee she could reapply for a position when she recovered, because both the plain language of the statute and its recognized purpose focus on returning an injured employee to work, and thus, reinstatement, rather than reapplication, is required; the employee's attorney made a formal demand for reinstatement, which the employer refused.
   Ark. Dep't of Corr. v. Jennings, 2017 Ark. App. 446, 526 S.W.3d 924 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly awarded an employee benefits under subsection (a) of this section as the employee properly claimed that she was entitled to benefits under Arkansas workers' compensation law; while the employee, as a probationary employee, was not covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act's (FMLA) job-protection provisions, she was not seeking a remedy under the FMLA, and thus, the FMLA was irrelevant to the case.

       For Arkansas workers who are injured on the job, subsection (a) of this section provides job protections apart from, and in addition to, what the federal government provides pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA); the state legislature has deemed it appropriate to grant enhanced job protections for those who are injured on the job, beyond what the FMLA generally provides for all covered employees.

       Just as the Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not actually calculate the employee's average weekly wage, it did not specify that the employee was to be paid that wage for a full year; instead, the Commission simply cited to factors required before benefits could be awarded and the statute for the principle that the benefits covered the period in which the employer refused to reinstate the claimant
       <i>
        up to a year
       </i>
       , and the award was proper.

   Compensation Commission clearly found a claimant's supervisor's testimony that the sheriff's department could accommodate the claimant's restrictions to be credible, even though the claimant could not identify a particular job at the department that met her restrictions. Thus, the Commission's decision to award benefits to the claimant pursuant to this section was supported by substantial evidence.

      <p>
       The requirement of subsection (a)(2) that the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement must be taken into account in determining whether suitable employment for an injured employee is available only pertains to the matter of seniority. Needham v. Harvest Foods, 64 Ark. App. 141, 987 S.W.2d 278 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employee worked a combination driver, he sustained a compensable injury to his right foot and could no longer perform his job duties. Because the collective bargaining agreement precluded his transfer to a road driver position, the employer's refusal to return him to work was not unreasonable; therefore, the employee was not entitled to benefits under subsection (a) of this section.

       At a minimum, subsection (a) requires that when an employee who has suffered a compensable injury attempts to re-enter the work force the employer must attempt to facilitate the re-entry into the work force by offering additional training to the employee, if needed, and reclassification of positions, if necessary.

      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing an injured employee to “reapply” and “be considered” for employment is not sufficient to meet the statutory requirement that the employer return the employee to work; that is because the option to “reapply” and “be considered” for employment necessarily involves an element of uncertainty as to the outcome of the application process, and both the plain language of the statute and its recognized purpose focus on returning an injured employee to work.

      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in awarding the claimant wage-loss benefits in excess of the claimant's anatomical impairment, because given the undisputed evidence that the claimant was contacted by the employer's vocational rehabilitation specialist but refused to speak to her until after the hearing was concluded, the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn was that a rehabilitation plan existed and that the claimant manifested an unwillingness to cooperate.

      </p>
      <p>
       Commission may properly take a claimant's refusal to pursue rehabilitation into account in determining his degree of disability where that refusal hinders the commission's attempts to assess the extent of disability. Second Injury Fund v. Robison, 22 Ark. App. 157, 737 S.W.2d 162 (1987).
      </p>

       Where the commission did not consider the claimant's failure to request rehabilitation analysis to be an impediment to its determination of permanent total disability, which it found based upon his physical injury, his age, his second-grade education, and his unskilled manual labor experience, the commission was not required to consider claimant's failure to request rehabilitation in determining the degree of his disability.

   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that an employer did not prove that an employee acted unreasonably in refusing to cooperate with a job-placement counselor and, thus, that subdivision (b)(3) of this section was not a bar to partial wage-loss disability because the Commission did not implement the wrong burden of proof when it was the employer's burden to establish the defense enumerated in subdivision (b)(3), and it failed in its burden; a vocational counselor identified a list of jobs, and the employee made no effort to pursue those jobs or any other employment, but the employee thought it would serve no purpose to apply for those jobs given his inability to stand for extended periods, the pain associated with his compensable injury, and the effect of his pain medication, and whether or not the employee was in fact capable of performing any of those jobs, the Commission did not find his lack of cooperation unreasonable under the circumstances,

       Additional findings were needed on whether an employee was entitled to benefits under subsection (a) of this section stemming from his work as a bus driver for the employer school district. The Commission was instructed to consider whether the employee's work as a bus driver was separate from, or part and parcel of, his maintenance work, which he was unable to perform; and if the bus driver work was considered separate, then whether the employee was entitled to section benefits under subsection (a).

      <p>
       Where an employee has alleged two separate injuries, one being a work-related physical injury, for which she has received workers' compensation benefits, and one being a subsequent nonphysical injury arising from employer's action in terminating her based upon her physical disability as a result of the injury, the first injury is exclusively cognizable under the Workers' Compensation Act (see § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-105" target="_self">11-9-105</a></cite>), while the subsequent injury is of the type envisioned by the Arkansas Civil rights Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c123s16-123-101" target="_blank">16-123-101</a></cite> et seq.Davis v.

      </p>
      <p>
       There is no remedy under this chapter for an employee who is terminated from his or her job on the basis of a disability after the end of the rehabilitation and compensation period; thus, the exclusive-remedy provision of this chapter does not preclude an employee from bringing an action under the Arkansas Civil Rights Act, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c123s16-123-101" target="_blank">16-123-101</a></cite> et seq., based upon employer's alleged discrimination in terminating her on the basis of her permanent restrictions and impairments.

      </p>
      <p>
       Employee was properly denied workers' compensation benefits as it was the employee's actions, by not clearing her days off with her new supervisor when she returned to light-duty work and by taking a day off without permission and not calling in to work, that caused her job to be terminated. Roark v. Pocahontas Nursing & Rehab., 95 Ark. App. 176, 235 S.W.3d 527 (2006).

      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported the determination by the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission that the employee altered the number of refills on the prescribed pain medication, justifying termination by the employer for falsifying work documents, because the nurse's testimony established the doctor's office procedure regarding the changing of a prescription, and the employer had a legitimate interest concerning when and if injured employees were being treated by physicians with the prescription of medication and the length of time the employee would be under the influence of the medication.

       Workers'
   compensation commission erred in determining that claimant was not entitled to temporary total disability benefits after the date he began receiving unemployment benefits because the claim fell within subsection (b) of this section; thus, the case was remanded to the commission for a factual determination regarding whether claimant remained within his healing period and suffered a total incapacity to earn wages after his receipt of unemployment compensation began.

       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission erred in denying payment for expenses incurred for prescribed medications over the time period at issue as there was proof that employee's authorized physician and several successive physicians prescribed the medications to relieve pain associated with employee's compensable injury; further, there was no evidence that some of the medications were unrelated to the medical treatment employee was receiving for his work-related injury.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission decision that an employee was entitled to additional medical benefits to cover the cost of surgery was supported by substantial evidence, even though several doctors opined that spinal surgery would be to correct a congenital condition and not an injury related to a work-related incident. Because the Commission discussed the opinions of all of the doctors who evaluated the employee, it did not arbitrarily disregard any evidence; the Commission was simply confronted with opposing medical opinions and chose to accept the opinion of the physician whom the Commission found to be most credible.

       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'

There was evidence upon which the ALJ could find that the March 16, 2005 injury had resolved by the end of March 2005.

      <p>
       Decision of the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission to deny an employee any further medical treatment was supported by substantial evidence even though the court of appeals could have reached a different result because although the medical testimony conflicted, resolving the conflicting medical evidence, making credibility determinations, and deciding what weight to give particular pieces of evidence was within the Commission's province; the Commission's opinion was very detailed and thorough, and it went over the medical records and opinions of the many doctors who treated and evaluated the employee.

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in denying an employee's claim for additional benefits in the form of pain management because evidence supporting the Commission's finding that a neurosurgeon did not recommend additional treatment was the neurosurgeon's final release to work, no recommended follow-up care, and the contradiction between the medical records and the employee's testimony that his doctors recently treated his pain with prescriptions.

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in awarding an employee additional benefits because substantial evidence supported its finding that additional medical treatment was reasonably necessary and that the employee remained within his healing period and unable to earn wages; the employer failed to give the employee the change-of-physician form after his injury, and thus, the employee was not required to petition the Commission in order to be treated by a competent doctor.

       Where appellee employee sustained an injury when a forklift struck him in his hip and back, substantial evidence supported the award of additional medical treatment under subsection (a) of this section for an MRI of his lumbar spine, pain management and medication, and psychological treatment of his anxiety and depression. His doctor's reports contained findings of emotional problems caused by the injury and recommended additional treatment for pain management; there was no contradicting doctor's opinion.

      <p>
       Workers'

      <p>
       Decision to deny a claimant's request for additional medical benefits under subsection (a) of this section was supported by substantial evidence since the Workers'

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's opinion displayed a substantial basis under subsection (a) of this section for denying additional medical treatment received by an employee after July 9, 2010, which included both of the employee's back surgeries, because after reporting a compensable injury to the employer in April 2008, the employee continued to work and did not seek medical treatment until July 2008.

       In a workers'

Moreover, a doctor opined that surgery would not have improved the claimant's elbow complaints.

       Workers'

      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly decided to award an employee additional medical treatment because substantial evidence was presented that her injury aggravated, accelerated, or combined with the condition to cause her current disabling condition and need for medical treatment; the Commission gave credence to a doctor's note that the employee's pain was the result of a work-related injury and that the employee was not having any back or leg symptoms prior to the injury.

      <p>
       Finding that claimant had not proven that he was entitled to any additional medical treatment in the form of pain management was not supported by substantial evidence; instead of denying additional narcotic medications based on the evidence of the claimant's addiction history, the Workers'
   Compensation Commission found that he had not proven that any additional medical treatment in the form of pain management as recommended by a doctor was reasonable or related to his work injury, but there was no medical proof that the claimant's condition did not warrant further treatment.

      </p>
      <p>
       Employer had not shown that it raised any argument regarding construction of reasonable and necessary under this section to the Workers'
   Compensation Commission, and the employer was simply questioning the employee's need for additional physical therapy and its appropriateness for her injury, which were factual questions for the Commission. There was substantial evidence to support the award of additional medical treatment in the form of physical therapy, given the physical therapist's opinion and the doctor's opinion that the employee needed physical therapy.

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported a finding that a benefits claimant was entitled to additional treatment for a knee injury; the claimant was released from medical care with a 2% permanent impairment rating in 2012 after undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus, and he contended that he continued to suffer chronic pain and instability. The weight of the evidence, the interpretation of the medical evidence, and the credibility of the claimant's testimony were matters for the Workers'
   Compensation Commission to decide.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a workers'
   compensation case, an additional surgery recommended for a compensable right shoulder injury was reasonable and necessary under this section because a claimant had an obvious deformity to his right shoulder and continued to have functional limitations and pain after four prior surgeries. Another medical opinion was not relied on because that evaluation was performed a year earlier, and the claimant's condition continued to deteriorate during the intervening time period.

      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in affirming and adopting the administrative law judge's award of additional medical benefits to the claimant for the treatment of his compensable shoulder injury as the Commission's decision to award the claimant additional medical benefits in the form of distal clavicle resection surgery was supported by substantial evidence. Two doctors expressed opinions that the resection was necessary to address the claimant's work-related injury; the claimant testified that he had no problem performing his work duties prior to the 2012 injury and that he had never before experienced similar pain; and the claimant would not have required the surgery but for the compensable injury.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in finding that an employee failed to prove entitlement to additional medical treatment because reasonable minds could not come to the conclusion that further medical treatment for carpal-tunnel syndrome was not reasonable and necessary; there was no evidence that the left carpal-tunnel syndrome had resolved, that the healing period for the injury had ended, or that maximum medical improvement had been declared regarding it.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that the claimant had proved entitlement to additional medical treatment (back surgery) because, after being informed about the claimant's recovery and return to work after a prior back surgery, the claimant's second doctor ultimately concluded that there was not much doubt in his mind that the claimant's need for further treatment occurred as a result of the May 2015 work-related injury; and, although the claimant's first doctor opined that the proposed surgery was not related to the work injury and would not alleviate the claimant's pain, he acknowledged that the second doctor subscribed to a different school of thought regarding whether the surgery would benefit the claimant's condition.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in granting additional medical treatment to the claimant, specifically, the recommended spinal surgery, because the Commission was confronted with multiple medical opinions and credited the first doctor's recommendation for spinal surgery; and an independent peer-review report regarding the claimant's proposed treatment agreed with the first doctor's recommendation and opined that the proposed spinal surgery was indicated and medically appropriate.

      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant proved her entitlement to additional medical treatment for the compensable injury to her left knee; although the claimant had an extensive history of problems with her left knee before the compensable injury, the claimant's charge nurse when she worked for the employer testified that the claimant was able to do her job without any problems and never complained about her knee or had to use a cane, but, after the injury, she had to wear a metal brace and use crutches, could not drive, and was unable to do anything but sit-down jobs; and the administrative law judge concluded that the work-related incident aggravated her prior knee problems and that the need for surgery was causally related to the work-related incident.

       Although compensable injuries must be established by medical evidence supported by objective findings, and complaints of pain are not objective medical findings as objective findings are those that cannot come under the voluntary control of the patient, a claimant who has sustained a compensable injury is not required to offer objective medical evidence to prove entitlement to additional benefits.

      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that a claimant was entitled to additional medical treatment in the form of surgery; although the Commission was confronted with competing and differing medical opinions from multiple doctors, the Commission weighed the evidence, gave greater credibility to the opinion of the only doctor who actually examined the claimant, and concluded from the evidence before it that the requested surgery was reasonable and necessary.
   Macsteel v. Hindmarsh, 2019 Ark. App. 458, 588 S.W.3d 53 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of ongoing pain management was affirmed where the parties stipulated that the claimant had sustained a compensable lower-back injury, and her credible testimony, together with the medical records documenting a worsening of symptoms, was sufficient to prove a causal connection between the claimant's continued need for treatment and the work-related injury.

       Decision by Worker's Compensation Commission to award additional medical treatment to claimant in the form of spinal-fusion surgery was affirmed; in view of opposing medical evidence, it could not be said that fair-minded persons with the same facts before them could not have reached the conclusions arrived at by the Commission.

       Medical evidence supported the finding that the worker failed to prove that she was entitled to additional medical treatment for her back injury, as one doctor reported there was nothing else that could be done, two doctors concluded that she was not a candidate for surgery, and one found she had reached maximum medical improvement; medical documents showed she had been complaining of left hip and leg pain before sustaining her work injury, and the decision to deny additional treatment for her back injury had a substantial basis.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in denying the former employee's claim for additional medical treatment because the employee failed to prove a causal connection between the compensable injury to his left foot and his peripheral artery disease (PAD). The record was devoid of any medical evidence that the claimant's PAD was work-related. One month after the compensable injury, when the first doctor diagnosed PAD, he did not relate that diagnosis to the work-related accident; a second doctor reported that the PAD was not work-related; and the claimant's vascular problems were bilateral and were detected in both legs commencing at or just below the hips, continuing through the thighs all the way to the feet.

       There was substantial evidence to support the denial of additional medical treatment as not related to the claimant's 2011 or 2013 work injuries; her recent compensable strain injuries were deemed resolved after nearly five months of treatment, and while the claimant testified that the conditions worsened after the May 2013 incident, her credibility was in issue, and it was noted that she had been released from care after her 2011 accident because her physician found her to be dishonest in her reporting and that she had been malingering.

       There was no evidence in the record that former employee did not suffer from coccydynia or coccygeal pain, that her pain condition stemmed from anything other than the compensable injury she sustained while working for her former employer, or that her condition did not warrant further treatment; thus, the Workers' Compensation Commission erred when it denied the employee continued medical treatment for a chronic-pain condition resulting from her work-related-injury. Patchell v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 86 Ark. App. 230, 184 S.W.3d 31 (2004).

       Court overturned an order from the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission holding that employee failed to prove her cervical surgery was reasonably necessary under subsection (a) of this section because the Commission's opinion did not address the surgical report or the post-surgical diagnosis; the reports might have contained evidence linking employee's injuries to a robbery in which she was choked and dragged.

       Employee was examined by various physicians, none of whom recommended any future treatment options other than physical therapy, and although the physicians initially recommended physical therapy for the employee, she refused to participate in the recommended therapy because she found it too painful; thus, substantial evidence supported the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that the employee was not entitled to additional medical treatment.

      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission erred in determining that additional medical treatment, including but not limited to a neurologist's recommendations, was not necessary under subsection (a) of this section where it relied heavily on the opinion of the poison control center director, that opinion was based upon inaccurate assumptions and speculation surrounding the employee's exposure to chemicals through an air conditioning unit, the director's opinion assumed that the employee did not suffer from symptoms that normally accompanied chemical inhalation, but the medical reports revealed that she had in fact suffered from such symptoms, and the MRI the neurologist had recommended to compare with the SPECT scan results was not done because the insurer refused to pay for it.

       Where an employee sustained a compensable heart injury by inhaling toxic smoke, substantial evidence supported the Arkansas Workers'

      <p>
       Appellate court affirmed an award of additional medical benefits based on the injuries a claimant sustained when the bucket of the front-end loader he was driving unexpectedly dropped, causing his face to hit the steering wheel and dashboard. The Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission found the opinion of an ear, nose, and throat specialist that the claimant's facial injuries were caused by the accident was credible and the treatment that the specialist provided was reasonably necessary in connection with the claimant's compensable injury under subsection (a) of this section; substantial evidence supported these findings.
   Owens Planting Co. v. Graham, 102 Ark. App. 299, 284 S.W.3d 537 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding against the employee in a workers'
   compensation action was inappropriate pursuant to subsection (a) of this section because it was erroneous to have found that the employee failed to seek reasonably necessary medical treatment when she sought periodic examinations to determine whether a medically foreseeable condition related to her compensable injury was advancing. A doctor had consistently recommended that the employee be periodically evaluated to allow for proper monitoring of her condition and periodic evaluations of a medically foreseeable condition related to a compensable injury constituted reasonably necessary medical treatment.

      <p>
       Where the employee's former doctors pronounced his maximum medical improvement from a back injury and assigned a five-percent impairment rating, the employee failed to show that an EMG diagnostic study recommended by a new doctor was reasonably necessary in connection with his compensable injury for purposes of subsection (a) of this section. The Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission had a substantial basis for denying payment.

       Workers'

      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'

      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's finding that the employee satisfied her burden of proving that her psychiatric treatment was reasonably necessary in connection with her work-related injury was supported by substantial evidence; it was essentially undisputed that the employee suffered from significant pain and a doctor opined that pain made depression worse and depression made pain worse, creating a merry-go-round of stress-related medical problems. Moreover, the doctor also reported that the employee's psychiatric impairment was raised from a class-two level to a class-three level as a result of her compensable injury.

      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial basis existed for the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that additional diagnostic testing was not reasonably necessary for the treatment of a claimant's compensable injuries; she was released to full duty and reported no continuing problems for four years until her new treating physician recommended additional diagnostic testing.
   Chanslor v. Sonic Drive-In, 2010 Ark. App. 557 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported a finding by the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission that a second surgery on an employee's left knee was reasonable, necessary, and related to the employee's compensable injury, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, because the first surgery was unsuccessful and the employee never had left-knee problems prior to suffering the compensable injury.
   Richardson Waste, Inc. v. Corcoran, 2010 Ark. App. 817, 379 S.W.3d 77 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   compensation claimant's psychiatric treatment was reasonably necessary and causally related to the claimant's compensable back injury, as substantial evidence showed that the claimant's chronic pain exacerbated the claimant's depression; thus, a finding that the employer was liable for such treatment under this section was proper.
   Aegon Ins. United States v. Durham-Gilpatrick, 2010 Ark. App. 827, 378 S.W.3d 773 (2010), review denied, — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Ark. LEXIS 277 (Ark. June 23, 2011).

      </p>
      <p>
       Finding that an employee in a workers'
   compensation action was not entitled to medical treatment from a doctor in connection with the employee's compensable back injury was appropriate under subsection (a) of this section and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-705ol1a3" target="_self">11-9-705(a)(3)</a></cite> because the doctor's statement that the injuries “could” have been caused by her accident at work was insufficient under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol116B" target="_self">11-9-102(16)(B)</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Employee was not entitled to additional medical treatment because, after testing and treatment, the consensus of the medical experts was that her back was essentially normal, and no surgical treatment was necessary. Any additional medical treatment the employee needed was more likely related to her preexisting scoliosis or her prior motor-vehicle accident.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's conclusion that further medical treatment for an employee's hernia injury was not reasonably necessary under subsection (a) of this section was supported by substantial evidence because diagnostic testing had ruled out a recurrent hernia, nerve damage, or inflammation, and two physicians did not consider the employee to be a surgical candidate.

       In a worker's compensation case, there was no error in finding that a surgical procedure was a reasonable and necessary treatment for the thoracic spine. Even though an employer contended that it was a risky procedure, the weight and probative value given to medical opinions was a function left to the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission.
   Walgreen Co. v. Goode, 2012 Ark. App. 196, 395 S.W.3d 398 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that the claimant proved, as required by subsection (a) of this section, that additional medical treatment was reasonably necessary in connection with his compensable back injury as the claimant's physician had stated his opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, and he reaffirmed that opinion during his deposition.
   Hyde's Termite & Pest Control v. Rogers, 2012 Ark. App. 410 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, substantial evidence supported the determination that the treatment given by one doctor was causally related to and necessary for treating the claimant's compensable injury; a 2006 MRI showed a moderate herniation, but a 2010 MRI showed a large herniation, and although a medical center claimed that a physican's opinion concerning compensability was not stated within a reasonable degree of certainty under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol116B" target="_self">11-9-102(16)(B)</a></cite>, the court disagreed because the physician and doctor related the treatment and surgery to the compensable cervical-spine injury, the Workers'
   Compensation Commission credited their opinions, and the court left the weighing of the medical evidence to the Commission.
   St. Edward Mercy Med. Ctr. &amp; Sisters of Mercy Health Sys. v. Chrisman, 2012 Ark. App. 475, 422 S.W.3d 171 (2012).

      <p>
       Because the court affirmed the award of additional medical treatment, the court also affirmed the award of temporary total disability benefits associated with the treatment.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's findings did not adequately support its denial of additional medical treatment; the fact that injections proposed by the employee's physician were directed toward pain management did not disqualify them from being reasonably necessary under subsection (a) of this section if that treatment was causally related to the compensable injury.
   Stallworth v. Hayes Mech., Inc., 2013 Ark. App. 188 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that an injured employee was not entitled to additional medical treatments because she failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that surgical intervention was reasonable and necessary. Three physicians concluded that the employee would not benefit from surgical intervention.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in holding that an employee's left-knee replacement surgery was not reasonable and necessary medical treatment under subsection (a) of this section for his compensable left-knee injury because it was the opinion of the employee's physician that arthritis was the need for the knee replacement.
   Jackson v. O'Reilly Auto., Inc., 2013 Ark. App. 755 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission’s opinion adequately explained its decision and its findings regarding medical causation were supported by substantial evidence because it found that an employee proved that he suffered a compensable injury to his right knee, that he was entitled to temporary total-disability benefits, and that the medical treatment he received was reasonably necessary.
   St. John's Reg'l Health Ctr. v. Bartlett, 2014 Ark. App. 94 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly awarded an employee additional-medical benefits because he had been receiving various benefits for nearly two years before he filed an AR-C Form, the first hearing on the employee's claim for additional-medical benefits was held more than eight years later, the “additional follow-up care” sought by the employee was reasonably necessary medical treatment, and a subsequent car wreck was not an independent intervening cause of the employee's need for further medical treatment where his conduct was not unreasonable and he was never restricted from driving by any doctor.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a workers'
   compensation case, medical treatment provided for shortness of breath and chest pain was reasonable and necessary medical treatment for a work-related ankle injury; after the claimant began medication due to ongoing problems with his ankle, he sought treatment in the emergency room for a cardiac evaluation and diagnostic testing. Although objective medical evidence is necessary to establish the existence and extent of an injury, it is not essential to establish the causal relationship between the injury and a work-related accident.

      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission concluded that the employee was just a drug-seeking individual, but the Commission made two material mistakes of fact, including finding that the employee was only seeking medication, when it was undisputed that she was requesting additional pain management treatment, plus the Commission erred in finding that a discharge from treatment from one doctor was equivalent to his opinion that additional pain management treatment was not reasonable and necessary. On remand, the Commission was to make findings on the issue of whether additional pain management treatment was reasonably necessary.

      <p>
       In a workers'
   compensation case, there was no error in determining that a benefits claimant was entitled to treatment for a right-knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear because the Workers'

      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's denial of additional medical-treatment benefits under this section; no doctor recommended that the claimant receive surgery for his cervical-trapezius condition as additional treatment, and after the healing period, there were no further specific recommendations as to what treatments were medically necessary.
   Newby v. Century Indus., 2017 Ark. App. 527, 530 S.W.3d 386 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in finding the recommended additional medical treatment for the claimant’s compensable knee injury was reasonably necessary and in finding that the doctor’s medical opinion was not based on any mistake of material fact; it was not unreasonable for the claimant to have forgotten a single incident when he received an injection in his knee two years before his compensable injury, three years before seeing the doctor, and four years before his deposition. The doctor was aware of preexisting degenerative changes and substantial medical evidence supported the Commission’s finding that claimant proved the necessary causal connection between his injury and the need for a total knee replacement.

       Plain language of subsection (a) of this section and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-811" target="_self">11-9-811</a></cite> did not authorize the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission (Commission) to, sua sponte, order an independent medical examination (IME) after the parties had litigated compensability and additional benefits; these statutes did not give the Commission authority to reserve making determinations on compensability and additional benefits when those were the only issues litigated by the parties, and the Commission did not err in finding that the administrative law judge exceeded his authority when he ordered an IME.

       After appellant sustained a compensable injury to his back while taking the front-end loader off of a tractor, a neurologist examined appellant and found no sign of lumbar radiculopathy; he diagnosed appellant with a musculoskeletal injury superimposed on preexisting degenerative changes in his lower back. When the administrative law judge appointed a doctor to perform an independent medical evaluation pursuant to this section, he recommended surgery based on an MRI, a myelogram, and a post-myelogram CT; the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission ignored relevant evidence in finding that appellant was not entitled to additional medical treatment or disability benefits for his back injury.

       When fixing the amount of compensation, the compensation commission may consider the refusal of a claimant to submit to recommended surgery only when that refusal is unreasonable. Ouachita Marine & Indus. Corp. v. Morrison, 246 Ark. 882, 440 S.W.2d 216 (1969).

       If certain proven surgical procedures are available and there is indication the employee's disability could be diminished by the procedures, and the employee declines to submit to them, the commission certainly has the right to consider this in determining the employee's disability.

       This section is silent as to whether the employer or employee has the right to make the choice of an initial treating physician; section 11-9-508 implies that the employer has the right of first choice because the employer has a duty to provide medical services to an injured employee, but that section speaks only to the employer's duty to provide medical services or bear the expense of medical services, not to the method of providing medical treatment.

       Whether treatment is a result of a “referral” rather than a “change of physician” is a factual determination to be made by the commission which will be affirmed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence. Patrick v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., 39 Ark. App. 34, 833 S.W.2d 790 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a medical center did not apprise the Workers'
   Compensation Commission of an argument concerning the change of physical rules or get a ruling on the argument, this issue was waived the court did not need to address the merits on appeal.
   St. Edward Mercy Med. Ctr. & Sisters of Mercy Health Sys. v. Chrisman, 2012 Ark. App. 475, 422 S.W.3d 171 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court did not agree that a medical center sufficiently raised an issue regarding the change of physician rules; neither the administrative law judge (ALJ) nor the Workers'
   Compensation Commission made any ruling regarding the change of physician rules, the center did not complain about the omission of the issue from the ALJ's decision, and although the center submitted a copy of the signed AR-N form, no argument regarding the change of physician rules was made, plus there was no testimony concerning whether the AR-N form was delivered to the claimant, and thus the court could not reach the merits of the issue.
   St. Edward Mercy Med. Ctr. & Sisters of Mercy Health Sys. v. Chrisman, 2012 Ark. App. 475, 422 S.W.3d 171 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Merits of an issue relating to an authorized treating physician under this section were not considered because the issue was not raised or ruled on below. The Workers' Compensation Commission made no finding on whether appellants were responsible for paying for the treatment under the change-of-physician provisions.
   Ark. Dep't of Parks & Tourism v. Price, 2016 Ark. App. 109 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employer’s argument under this section concerning the claimant's failure to follow the statutory rules for a change of physician was not presented to the Workers'
   Compensation Commission and thus was not preserved for appellate review.
   Univ. of Cent. Ark. v. Srite, 2019 Ark. App. 511, 588 S.W.3d 849 (2019).

       Evidence supported finding that medical treatment was unauthorized. Jordan v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 51 Ark. App. 100, 911 S.W.2d 593 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although claimant testified that he attempted to see his authorized treating physician and that his authorized physician was not available so the nurse referred him to another physician, there was substantial evidence claimant failed to get required authorization where the insurance carrier testified that it refused to authorize payment for second physician's treatment, sent the commission's form A-11 to claimant's attorney and received no response, never received a bill from claimant or from second physician's office, and never received a referral slip showing that authorized physician had referred claimant to second physician. Pennington v. Gene Cosby Floor & Carpet, 51 Ark. App. 128, 911 S.W.2d 600 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court was obliged to strictly construe and apply the Workers' Compensation Act and where it was not disputed that the employee sought additional unauthorized, non-emergency treatment from three physicians, and employee admitted that the day after her injury her husband brought the form which notified the employee of employee's rights regarding a change of physician and the employee signed the form, the Workers' Compensation Commission's decision that employee's unauthorized treatment was not compensable was supported by substantial evidence. Sharp v. Lewis Ford, Inc., 78 Ark. App. 164, 78 S.W.3d 746 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly ruled that the carrier and employer did not have to pay for an employee's treatment with certain unauthorized physicians because she did not petition for a change-of-physician or follow the statute's provisions, and she signed a notice document that stated unauthorized medical expenses were her responsibility
   Butler v. Lake Hamilton Sch. Dist., 2013 Ark. App. 703, 430 S.W.3d 831 (2013).

      </p>
      <p>
       Employer lacked standing to raise constitutional challenge of the exemption of chiropractors from the approval requirements governing change of physicians in this section. County Mkt. v.

       Statutory requirements for a claimant's change of physician pursuant to subdivision (a)(3)(A)(iii) of this section were met where the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission explicitly granted the petition based upon the condition that the claimant's family doctor later agreed to comply with the terms of the statute; the statute did not mandate that the physician agree to comply with the terms before the Commission could grant the claimant's petition to a change of physician.

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the worker had first sought treatment in an emergency room did not mean that the worker had selected the emergency room physicians as his treating physician within the meaning of this section, and the worker did not have to petition the Workers' Compensation Commission for permission to change physicians before seeking treatment by the chiropractor. Stephens v. St. Vincent Infirmary, 15 Ark. App. 209, 691 S.W.2d 190 (1985).

      <p>
       A claimant did not commit misconduct where he was incarcerated for allegedly failing to make proper child-support payments, but the case against him was dismissed as a matter of law, notwithstanding the finding by the Appeal Tribunal that the claimant's failure to pay child support resulted in his incarceration and that this was an intentional disregard of his employer's interest.

       Conceding, without deciding, that insurance carrier has the right in the first instance to select the physician, it does not follow that injured compensation claimant's later choice of physician exempted insurer and insured from expense of surgical operation, demonstrated with certainty to have been necessary, but opposed by physician selected by insurer.

       Substantial evidence supported commission's finding that it was the claimant's own idea to obtain referral to a neurologist; therefore, the treatment was actually in the nature of a change of physicians and the employer was not responsible for this portion of the treatment.

       The fact that the employer had not contracted with a certified managed care entity did not mean that the employee/claimant was free to select any physician he wanted as, under subsection (b), the claimant could not change his physician, except for emergency treatment, and, therefore, he was responsible for services rendered by a new physician.

       The evidence did not support the contention that the claimant received a copy of the documentation explaining her rights and responsibilities concerning a change of physician in a timely manner. The claimant testified that she signed the rights notification form when she was first hired and not after she was injured; and at the time of her signature the “accident information” section was left blank. She further testified that she could not have signed the form after her injury because of the pain in her shoulder, which was so bad the nurse had to fill out the accident report for her. Finally, the claimant testified that the accident date written on the notification form was not in her handwriting. Stephenson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 70 Ark. App. 265, 19 S.W.3d 36 (2000).
      </p>

       Second doctor's treatment of a workers'

       An employer's initial failure to provide prompt and effective medical care and treatment to the injured claimant would not estop the employer from invoking the rule governing the proper procedures to be followed by a claimant prior to changing physicians; therefore, the commission abused its discretion when it ruled that the employer was liable for the payment of physicians who were consulted by the claimant without first giving notice to the employer.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section provides that the change of physician requirements outlined therein are inapplicable if the employer fails to deliver the claimant a copy of the statutory notice, failure to furnish the notice does not automatically render the employer liable for all treatment or services provided as the result of the subsequent change of physician. An employer who fails to provide the proper notice is only liable for medical treatments and services which are reasonably necessary for the treatment of the employee's injury. DeBoard v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Employer did not controvert employee's change-of-physician request where employee submitted a request for a change of physician only after employer refused to pay certain medical bills because they were not from the original treating physician; employee did not provide the name of the physician when requested to do so and employer was not responsible for knowing the name of the new doctor based on bills received prior to the submission of the request for change.

       Employee would be permitted treatment by out-of-state physician, where it would violate the employer's statutory duty to provide medical care if that care was denied simply because there was no medical service provider in Arkansas qualified and willing to provide the service. Milligan v. West Tree Serv., 57 Ark. App. 14, 946 S.W.2d 697 (1997), supp. op., Clark v. Director, Empl. Sec. Dep't, 58 Ark. App. 1, 944 S.W.2d 862.

       Evidence that employee was referred to a specific specialist held sufficient where employee's treating physician recommended that employee obtain continued care from a hand specialist, provided her with the names of two qualified specialists in that field, and employee obtained treatment from one of them based on this recommendation. American Greetings Corp. v. Garey, 61 Ark. App. 18, 963 S.W.2d 613 (1998).

       Referrals to specialists by the treating physician are authorized without making a change of physician. Jonesboro Human Dev. Ctr. v. Taylor, 61 Ark. App. 42, 963 S.W.2d 617 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission erred in denying employee medical benefits for visits to his regular physician where a treating specialist released him and referred him back to his original treating physician; there was nothing in the record that stated or even suggested that employee's regular physician did not remain an authorized physician throughout the case.

       The commission did not abuse its discretion in the retroactive approval of a change of physicians. Emerson Elec. Co. v. White, 262 Ark. 376, 557 S.W.2d 189 (1977) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the facts claimant was excused from formally petitioning for a change in physicians, and the commission did not abuse its discretion in granting retroactive approval of the change. Moro, Inc. v. Davis, 6 Ark. App. 92, 638 S.W.2d 694 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies retroactively since, prior to the 1981 amendment, it already contained a provision allowing a claimant to change physicians and that amendment did not disturb any vested right or create any new obligation but merely supplied a new or more appropriate remedy to enforce an existing right or obligation; therefore, where claimants' injury occurred before the 1981 amendment took effect, but the hearing before the law judge, his decision and the commission's decision to permit the claimant to change physicians occurred after the amendment, the section as amended would apply. Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken v. Willis, 7 Ark. App. 167, 646 S.W.2d 17 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the 1981 amendment to this section, the commission no longer has the broad discretion to retroactively approve change of physicians. American Transp. Co. v. Payne, 10 Ark. App. 56, 661 S.W.2d 418 (1983); Wright Contracting Co. v. Randall, 12 Ark. App. 358, 676 S.W.2d 750 (1984).

       Commission could not retroactively approve the change so as to make the employer liable. American Transp. Co. v. Payne, 10 Ark. App. 56, 661 S.W.2d 418 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the 1983 amendment to this section, allowing a claimant to change to a chiropractic physician by giving advance written notice to the employer or insurance carrier does not disturb any vested rights or create any new obligations; it merely removes certain procedural barriers and allows an injured employee to seek additional medical treatment. The amendment is entitled to retroactive application. Alexander v. Lee Way Motor Freight, 15 Ark. App. 41, 689 S.W.2d 3 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1981 amendment to this section is not limited in application to those workers whose injuries are sustained after its effective date, but is limited to changes in physicians made after that date; ordinarily, however, it cannot be retroactively applied to ratify a change which was unauthorized at the time the change was actually made. Sterling Stores v. Deen, 16 Ark. App. 36, 696 S.W.2d 784 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employer failed to comply with the mandates of this section, the change of physician rules did not apply and the employee was entitled to retroactive approval of a change of physician. Electro-Air v. Villines, 16 Ark. App. 102, 697 S.W.2d 932 (1985).

       Sufficient reason for change of physician found. Mad Butcher, Inc. v. Parker, 4 Ark. App. 124, 628 S.W.2d 582 (1982), superseded by statute as stated in, Wright Contracting Co. v. Randall, 12 Ark. App. 358, 676 S.W.2d 750 (1984) (decided under prior law); Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken v. Willis, 7 Ark. App. 167, 646 S.W.2d 17 (1983); Wright Contracting Co. v. Randall, 12 Ark.

      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (a)(3)(ii) of this section established an absolute, statutory right to a one-time change of physician under the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act where the employer had contracted with a managed care organization and had exercised the right to select the initial primary-care physician; thus, employer's denial of the one-time change of physician as a matter of law failed to fulfill the obligation imposed by § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-508" target="_self">11-9-508</a></cite>. Collins v. Lennox Indus., Inc., 77 Ark. App. 303, 75 S.W.3d 204 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding in favor of the employee in a workers' compensation action was proper where the employee exercised her absolute, statutory right to a one-time change of physician pursuant to subdivision (a)(3)(A)(ii) of this section; thus, the employer and carrier were required to pay for the initial visit to the new physician in order to fulfill their obligation to provide adequate medical services under the provisions of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-508" target="_self">11-9-508</a></cite>. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Brown, 82 Ark. App. 600, 120 S.W.3d 153 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       After the employee's former doctors pronounced his maximum medical improvement from a back injury and assigned a five-percent impairment rating, the employee petitioned and received a change of physicians in accordance with subdivision (a)(3)(A) of this section. Because the employee failed to show that an EMG diagnostic study recommended by his new doctor was reasonably necessary, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission had a substantial basis for denying payment.
   Goyne v. Crabtree Contr. Co., 2009 Ark. App. 200, 301 S.W.3d 16 (2009), rehearing denied, — Ark. App. —, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Ark. App. LEXIS 874 (Apr. 22, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision to allow a change of physician was supported by substantial evidence because a benefits claimant was not receiving the treatment that she was entitled to due to her first physician's deterioration in health and ultimate death. The claimant went to another doctor because her first physician was unable to perform his duties due to his advanced age and declining health at the time she attempted to treat with him.
   Wal-Mart Assocs. v. Keys, 2012 Ark. App. 559, 423 S.W.3d 683 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Benefits claimant's treatment was not compensable because she was not referred to a disputed provider by one of her authorized physicians, and she did not apply for a change of physician under this section; the provisions of subsection (f) of this section were not met in this case where an employer would not have challenged a valid exercise of the right to a one-time change of physician, and there was no evidence to show that the claimant made a claim for any specific medical benefit with any of her authorized doctors.

       Where after suffering a second injury similar to the first, the claimant's employer directed her to a different doctor for treatment of the second injury, the claimant did not violate the provision of this section requiring her to get authorization from the commission in order to change physicians, because the change of physicians was directed by the employer and not initiated by the claimant.

       Where employer and employee mutually agreed to change of physician from the company doctor to employee's family doctor, without the commission being petitioned for a change, the mutually agreed upon change was not employee's first and only change under this section; therefore, employee could petition commission for subsequent change of physician.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the doctor who was treating claimant wished to have claimant examined by another doctor, the treatment by the other doctor was a referral, not a change of physicians. Electro-Air v.

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in awarding an employee additional benefits because substantial evidence supported its finding that additional medical treatment was reasonably necessary and that the employee remained within his healing period and unable to earn wages; the employer failed to give the employee the change-of-physician form after his injury, and thus, the employee was not required to petition the Commission in order to be treated by a competent doctor.

        Exceptional Circumstances.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       There were no “exceptional circumstances” requiring application of subsection (c) of this section, because while the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission urged that the claimant would earn more in fifty-two weeks than his contracted amount, this was merely speculative and there was simply no evidence in the record regarding the claimant's past or prospective annual earnings with this or any other employer. The claimant was engaged in seasonal employment and at the time of his injury was earning $1020 per week for nine weeks of work, and in arriving at his weekly compensation rate the Commission stated that the claimant was contracted to earn $9180 over a nine-week period, which averaged $1020 per week, and the Commission divided the $9180 by fifty-two weeks, which equaled $176.54 per week, which was multiplied by 662/3 percent for a weekly compensation rate of $118 per week.
   Sierra v. Griffin Gin, 100 Ark. App. 113, 265 S.W.3d 129 (2007), rehearing denied, Sierra v. Griffen Gin, — Ark. App. —, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Ark. App. LEXIS 775 (Nov. 7, 2007), superseded, 374 Ark. 320, 287 S.W.3d 556 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where workers'
   compensation claimant admitted that the claimant did not always work a full 40-hour week because the employer allowed the claimant to take unpaid leave when the claimant wanted, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly found that exceptional circumstances existed because the claimant took unpaid time off from work for personal reasons; thus, the claimant's annual earnings were divided by 52 weeks without taking into account vacation time.
   Maulding v. Price's Util. Contrs., Inc., 2009 Ark. App. 776, 358 S.W.3d 915 (2009), rehearing denied, 2010 Ark. App. 51 (2010), review denied, — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Ark. LEXIS 222 (Apr. 22, 2010), review denied, — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Ark. LEXIS 227 (Apr. 22, 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Determination of a workers'
   compensation claimant's average weekly wage (AWW) based on exceptional circumstances under subsection (c) of this section was supported by substantial evidence where the claimant's business expenses were deducted from his gross receipts; it was not the function of the appellate court to conclude whether there was an alternative way to compute the AWW.

       Where the claimant sustained a compensable injury while working, but was also employed in another job, his compensation benefits were properly based on his wages earned at job in which he was injured rather than on the combined incomes of his jobs. Hart's Exxon Serv. Station v. Prater, 268 Ark. 961, 597 S.W.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The clear wording of the statutory definition of “wages” in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102" target="_self">11-9-102</a></cite> makes no provision for combining wages from concurrent employments in determining benefits. Curtis v. Ermert Funeral Home &amp; Ins. Co. of N. Am., 4 Ark. App. 274, 630 S.W.2d 57 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section concerns itself exclusively with the determination of “average weekly wage,” and the definition of the word “wage” is controlled and supplied by § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol18" target="_self">11-9-102(8)</a></cite> (now (19)): it makes no provision for combining those wages with concurrent employment whether similar or otherwise in determining benefits, and the fact that the word “wage” is not redefined in the catchall proviso to this section is not controlling since that definition is supplied by § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol18" target="_self">11-9-102(8)</a></cite> (now (19)). Curtis v. Ermert Funeral Home &amp; Ins. Co. of N. Am., 4 Ark. App. 274, 630 S.W.2d 57 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The proper method for determination of the average weekly wage of an employee who holds two concurrent jobs with the same employer and suffers a compensable injury while performing one of them is to combine the wages paid for the two jobs. Marianna School Dist. v. Vanderburg, 16 Ark. App. 271, 700 S.W.2d 381 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a joint employment situation exists, both employers are liable for workers' compensation. Cook v. Recovery Corp., 50 Ark. App. 49, 900 S.W.2d 212 (1995), aff'd, 322 Ark. 707, 911 S.W.2d 581 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee who received two paychecks from separate employers for the same eight hour shift was appropriately limited to the statutory benefits cap based as a result of combining his wages even though his benefits, if calculated separately for each employer, would not have triggered the cap.

       Where the claimant's contract of hire provided for a 40-hour workweek whenever work was available, subdivision (a)(1) of this section required that the compensation rate be computed on the basis of a full-time workweek, despite the seasonal nature of the employment.

      <p>
       An averaging is required of the earnings of an employee of a temporary employment company who at the time of injury is working on a job assignment of less than a full week. Boyd v. Metro Temporaries, 41 Ark. App. 12, 846 S.W.2d 668 (1993), aff'd, 314 Ark. 479, 863 S.W.2d 316 (Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission erred in finding that a temporary employee was entitled only to the statutory minimum of weekly compensation. Boyd v. Metro Temporaries, 41 Ark. App. 12, 846 S.W.2d 668 (1993), aff'd, 314 Ark. 479, 863 S.W.2d 316 (Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a temporary employee is working on a job assignment involving a full workweek at the time of injury, then only the wage rate for that particular full workweek should be used as the basis for computing compensation. Boyd v. Metro Temporaries, 41 Ark. App. 12, 846 S.W.2d 668 (1993), aff'd, 314 Ark. 479, 863 S.W.2d 316 (Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employer of a temporary employee anticipated assigning employee to different jobs, with different hours, and at different wages, and did so, the contract of hire in force at the time of the accident was the employer's contract with the employee, not the particular job assignment; accordingly, the injured employee was entitled to receive benefits based upon averaging the hours worked at the different jobs. Metro Temporaries v. Boyd, 314 Ark. 479, 863 S.W.2d 316 (Ark. 1993).

       Where claimant suffered a compensable injury, received medical treatment, returned to his regular job and continued to work until he became totally disabled, claimant is entitled to the maximum weekly benefit rate in effect at the time the disability occurred, and this rate is based on the wages being earned on the date of the accident.

       Average weekly pay of injured employees whose rates of pay were increased within a year prior to the injury was to be ascertained by including amount previously received. Mack Coal Co. v. Hill, 204 Ark. 407, 162 S.W.2d 906 (1942) (decision under prior law).

       Periods of nonoperation of business must be counted as lost time thereby reducing the divisor to the number of weeks remaining as contrasted with 52. Mack Coal Co. v. Hill, 204 Ark. 407, 162 S.W.2d 906 (1942) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The proviso of former section that “results just and fair to both parties will thereby be obtained” applied only to those cases where reasonable men would agree that the methods of computing wages defeated the law's obvious purpose. Mack Coal Co. v. Hill, 204 Ark. 407, 162 S.W.2d 906 (1942) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under former Workers' Compensation Act the basis for compensation was the average weekly wage, which included wages paid by the employer and subsistence allowances under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act. Wood Mercantile Co. v. Cole, 213 Ark. 68, 209 S.W.2d 290 (1948) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employee is working on a piece-rate basis, bonus, holiday and vacation pay is not to be included in the computation of the average weekly wage. Tabor v. Levi Strauss & Co., 33 Ark. App. 71, 801 S.W.2d 311 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where union contract specifically provided overtime was to be paid at one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay, overtime earnings were ordered to be calculated by including all earnings received for work performed in excess of eight hours in any one day and then dividing overtime earnings by the number of weeks worked by the employee not to exceed a period of 52 weeks preceding the accident, the number of weeks to be reduced by those weeks in which the employee did not work. Tabor v. Levi Strauss & Co., 33 Ark. App. 71, 801 S.W.2d 311 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary employee is entitled to receive benefits based upon an averaging of the hours worked and wages received at the different jobs to which he was assigned. A & C Servs., Inc. v. Sowell, 44 Ark. App. 150, 870 S.W.2d 764 (1994).

      <p>
       Where the claimant was injured in 1977, but was able to continue working without loss of income until two accidents which occurred in 1996, his date of accident was 1996 and his compensation rate would be based on his 1996 earnings. Inskeep v. Emerson Elec. Co., 64 Ark. App. 101, 983 S.W.2d 132 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's contract provided for the employee to teach 188 days, and stated that she would be docked $143.62 per diem for any absences during any leave-without-pay status; thus, the compensation was correctly computed on the average weekly wage earned by the employee, which was based on a 39-week year, not a 52-week year. Magnet Cove Sch. Dist. v. Barnett, 81 Ark. App. 11, 97 S.W.3d 909 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employee had been promoted shortly before her accident, the Workers' Compensation Commission properly calculated her average weekly wage using employee's hourly wage at the time of the accident plus overtime for the previous year where, at the time of and after her accident, she was working extensive hours at that wage, despite occasionally performing other jobs at a lower wage. Cracker Barrel v. Lassiter, 87 Ark. App. 286, 190 S.W.3d 911 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's determination of employee's weekly compensation rate was upheld where the Commission followed a method of calculation consistent with its statutory call; the Commission's refusal to dilute employee's average weekly wage based on time that he missed due to excused leave did not produce a double recovery.
   Rheem Mfg. v. Bark, 97 Ark. App. 224, 245 S.W.3d 716 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Per diem payments to an employee to reimburse him for meals, lodging, and incidentals should have been included in the calculation of his average weekly wage as in subdivision (a)(1) of this section because they fell within the definition of wages under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol119" target="_self">11-9-102(19)</a></cite>. The per diem payments saved the employee from expending other funds to acquire those advantages, and the employee had the option to retaining any unused per diem funds, thereby increasing his income.

      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in basing an employee's benefits on a thirty-seven-and-one-half hour workweek, which was a full workweek for the employee, because no one disputed the employee's testimony that although he was at work forty hours per week, he did not get paid for his thirty-minute lunch break, so he worked thirty-seven-and-one-half hours per week, and while there were weeks in which the employee did not work thirty-seven-and-one-half hours, he testified that that was his normal workweek; subdivision (a)(1) of this section clearly mandates that in no case shall compensation be computed on less than a full-time workweek.

In finding that a scheduled-injury claimant was prohibited from entitlement to permanent total disability benefits in excess of the percentage of his physical impairment and that such a claim had to meet the multiple-loss requirements, the Commission impermissibly expanded the statutory prohibition of a claim for permanent partial disability benefits except in a case of multiple losses.

       Where the claimant was prima facie within the former “odd-lot” category based on the Workers' Compensation Commission's factual findings of disability and borderline mental retardation along with the undisputed evidence of claimant's advanced age and lack of education or vocational training, the burden shifted to the employer to show evidence that suitable work was regularly and continuously available to the claimant, and where the employer failed to do so, the claimant was awarded total and permanent disability benefits.

       Although employer argued that the only evidence of employee having muscle spasms was her self-serving testimony and the subjective history that she gave to an emergency room nurse five months after her alleged incident, it was undisputed that, at the time of the accident, the employee was diagnosed as having suffered thoracic and lumbar contusion and strain and that the company physician prescribed a medication for the relief of muscle spasms and other musculoskeletal conditions; thus, employer's argument that there was no medical evidence supporting objective findings of an injury was rejected and employee was entitled to temporary total disability benefits.

   Compensation Commission's finding that a claimant failed to prove that the claimant sustained a compensable head injury in a motor vehicle accident because there were no complaints by the claimant regarding the claimant's head or brain having been injured in the accident until more than two years following the event. Furthermore, there was no evidence that an MRI finding of scarring was related to the accident.

       Substantial evidence supported the award of additional temporary total disability benefits to a claimant based on the injuries he sustained when the bucket of the front-end loader he was driving unexpectedly dropped, causing his face to hit the steering wheel and dashboard. The Arkansas Worker's Compensation Commission credited an ear, nose, and throat specialist's opinion that, after nearly a year of treatment by the specialist, the claimant was unable to perform work of any kind, that he later reached a plateau with regard to the treatment provided by the specialist, but that he needed complete diagnostic testing before a final determination regarding maximum medical improvement could be made.

       Employee should have been awarded temporary total disability benefits where his healing period did not end on November 4, 2004, and the employer and insurer refused to authorize treatment that would be administered for the healing and alleviation of the employee's condition; the employee had not reached maximum medical improvement.

       After appellant sustained a compensable injury to his back on January 20, 2005, while taking the front-end loader off of a tractor, his employer and its insurer, paid temporary total disability (TTD) compensation to appellant through June 29, 2005; at that time a doctor assigned, and appellees paid out, a five-percent impairment rating. Where two doctors recommended surgery based on appellant's symptoms of radiculopathy, positive straight leg tests, an MRI, a nerve conduction study, and a CT, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission ignored relevant evidence in finding that appellant was not entitled to additional medical treatment or TDD benefits for his back injury.

When the employee's doctor signed a letter on February 12, 2007, at the request of the employee's attorney to confirm that it was necessary for the employee to remain off work pending additional treatment for his compensable injury, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission considered the doctor's two inconsistent acts and resolved the issue against the doctor's opinion that the employee's condition precluded him from working; the Commission did not err by denying the employee's claim for additional temporary-total disability benefits and medical treatment.

       Substantial evidence supported the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that an employee did not meet his burden of proving his entitlement to permanent-total or wage-loss disability benefits because the employee's compensable injury did not require surgery, he was issued only a one-percent impairment rating for it, the functional capacity evaluation evaluator concluded that the employee was capable of performing medium work, and neither of the employee's treating physicians opined that he was permanently and totally disabled or that he could not work, and the employee never presented any evidence that no “suitable work” existed for him; there was substantial evidence supporting the Commission's finding that the employee was not motivated to return to work because the employee admitted that he had not looked for work within the medium-work classification and that he had not contacted the employer to inquire about positions that were within his restrictions, and the Commission did not arbitrarily disregard the credibility of the employee and his complaints of pain.

      <p>
       There was a substantial basis to support the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's finding that an employee failed to prove that he was permanently and totally disabled because there was evidence demonstrating that the employee was not completely unable to earn meaningful wages; functional capacity evaluations rated the employee in the light-duty category of work, and even after his third surgery, the employee worked for more than a year in a light capacity.

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the denial of permanent total disability benefits under subdivision (e)(1) of this section, although the claimant presented medical evidence of an inability to work, because the administrative law judge was more persuaded by the opinions of the claimant's treating physician and the functional capacity evaluator that the claimant was capable of performing light-duty work.

      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's opinion displayed a substantial basis for denying an employee's claims for permanent total disability under the Worker's Compensation or additional wage-loss benefits because noting the employee's testimony and the reports of his surgeon, the Commission concluded that the only change in physical condition related to his compensable cervical injuries was the fact that his cervical problems had dramatically improved following his third cervical surgery; the Commission found that the employee was vastly improved since its prior decision awarding him benefits.

      </p>
      <p>
       Award of permanent total disability benefits to the employee was appropriate pursuant to subsection (c) of this section because the employer offered no proof to rebut the medical opinions that the employee's condition prevented him from working. The fact that the employee testified that he drove on a limited basis and that he drove some 305 miles over 13 hours to attend the hearing was not sufficient to prove that he could earn meaningful wages.

      <p>
       Claimant was not entitled to permanent-total-disability benefits under subdivision (e)(1) of this section because, following the claimant's most recent injury, his treating physicians were unable to make any new objective findings, and a functional-capacity evaluation indicated that he was able to perform medium-duty work.

      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the claimant's scarce attempts to return to work, her changing testimony regarding her abilities, and the lack of any opinion by a medical or vocational expert that she was unable to work, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision denying her permanent and total disability benefits under subdivision (e)(1) of this section was supported by substantial evidence.

      <p>
       Although the employee might be right that the factors considered by the Workers'
   Compensation Commission would also support a claim of total and permanent disability under this section, the court could not make that determination because the Commission's finding of permanent disability was supported in part by the improper odd-lot doctrine finding, and thus the court reversed in this regard and remanded.

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of claim for permanent and total disability and an assignment of 25-percent loss in wage-earning capacity was supported by substantial evidence, because the functional capacity evaluation and vocational evaluation both indicated that the employee was capable of performing sedentary and light work; there was no evidence that the employee could not find employment in or successfully perform any of the types of jobs listed in his vocational evaluation, not least of all since the employee never attempted to look for or apply for any job after his injury.

Little weight was given to another doctor's opinion that the claimant was unable to work because she relied on subjective and generalized information.

       In a workers'

It was within the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's authority to assess that weight and credibility differently than did the administrative law judge.

      <p>
       Commission may properly take a claimant's refusal to pursue rehabilitation into account in determining his degree of disability where that refusal hinders the commission's attempts to assess the extent of disability. Where the commission did not consider the claimant's failure to request rehabilitation analysis to be an impediment to its determination of permanent total disability, which it found based upon his physical injury, his age, his second-grade education, and his unskilled manual labor experience, the commission was not required to consider claimant's failure to request rehabilitation in determining the degree of his disability.

       Where an employee's disability had been worsened by her diabetes and obesity, which in turn had been exacerbated by the failure to follow diets prescribed for her, there was no evidence to support the Workers' Compensation Commission's conclusions that the employee's disability would be less than total were it not for the flare up of her diabetic condition, and no substantial basis for the commission's conclusion that she failed to prove entitlement.

       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission's analysis of temporary total disability for a back injury was flawed as it was based on the fact that none of the procedures after October 29, 2003, were successful in treating the condition, rather than deciding the issue on the medical evidence that was presented, which showed that employee remained within his healing period and was being treated with the goal of improving his medical condition.

       Although the commission's knowledge and experience is not evidence, once it has before it firm medical evidence of physical impairment and functional limitations, it has the advantage of its own superior knowledge of industrial demands, limitations and requirements and can apply its knowledge and experience in weighing the medical evidence of functional limitations together with other evidence of the manner in which the functional disability will affect the ability of an injured employee to obtain or hold a job, and thereby arrive at a reasonably accurate conclusion as to the extent of permanent partial disability as related to the body as a whole.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission is required to consider factors other than mere physical disability in making an award of permanent total disability. Thus, where the physicians assessed the claimant's physical impairment at only 5-10% disability, but the commission found 30% disability, the commission must have considered the claimant's age, education, and training, and since its determination was supported by the evidence, the commission did not err in finding that the claimant was not totally disabled.

       There was sufficient evidence to support the Workers' Compensation Commission's award of permanent disability benefits of 70% to the body as a whole, where the medical expert concurred that the employee could return to work but also agreed that he should curtail activities involving lifting, bending, and twisting his back, and his employment potential lay in work settings that would not require sustained physical exertion that might expose his back to new injury.

       There was substantial evidence to support finding that claimant was not temporarily totally disabled. Green v. Jacuzzi Bros., 269 Ark. 733, 600 S.W.2d 448 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       If during the period while the body is healing, the employee is unable to perform remunerative labor with reasonable consistency and without pain and discomfort, his temporary disability is deemed total. Pyles v. Triple F. Feeds of Texas, Inc., 270 Ark. 729, 606 S.W.2d 146 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary disability is a separate and distinct disability from any permanent disability and may be compensated separately. Arkansas State Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. Breshears, 271 Ark. 398, 609 S.W.2d 81 (1980), modified, Arkansas State Highway & Transp. Dep't v. Breshears, 272 Ark. 244, 613 S.W.2d 392 (Ark. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary total disability and the healing period in workers' compensation cases are not the same time periods in all cases since temporary total disability is that period within the healing period in which the employee suffers a total incapacity to earn wages under subdivision (5) of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102" target="_self">11-9-102</a></cite> and this section. Arkansas State Highway &amp; Transp. Dep't v. Breshears, 272 Ark. 244, 613 S.W.2d 392 (Ark. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employee's claim was originally brought against both the employer and the Second Injury Fund for temporary total disability and medical benefits, the Second Injury Fund was dismissed as a party, and the employee filed his pro se notice of appeal as to the Second Injury Fund only, the appeal was properly dismissed because the employee failed to properly make the employer a party on appeal and the Second Injury Fund was no longer a party. Garland v. Windsor Door, 19 Ark. App. 284, 719 S.W.2d 714 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Law does not authorize award of current total or limited total disability benefits after the end of the healing period. The concept of current total disability benefits seems to have been based on McNeely v. Clem Mill & Gin Co., 241 Ark. 498, 409 S.W.2d 502 (1966); to the extent that McNeely has been interpreted as holding that temporary benefits, regardless of how they are denominated, may be paid after the end of the healing period, that interpretation is erroneous. Arkansas Secretary of State v. Guffey, 291 Ark. 624, 727 S.W.2d 826 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recurring symptoms may give rise to a subsequent healing period after the original one has ended. Where a second complication is found to be a natural and probable result of the first injury, the employer remains liable, and this liability includes liability for additional temporary benefits when the employee undergoes a second, distinct healing period. Elk Roofing Co. v. Pinson, 22 Ark. App. 191, 737 S.W.2d 661 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases controlled by this section, temporary total disability is not based on the claimant's healing period, but is awarded where the claimant's injury-caused incapacity prevents him from earning the wages he was receiving at the time of the injury. County Mkt. v. Thornton, 27 Ark. App. 235, 770 S.W.2d 156 (1989), rehearing denied, County Market v. Thornton, 27 Ark. App. 235, 771 S.W.2d 793 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant was not entitled to temporary total disability benefits where he failed to prove a compensable, work-related injury. Johnson v. Hux, 28 Ark. App. 187, 772 S.W.2d 362 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Medical records clearly supported commission's findings that claimant was entitled to temporary total disability benefits for an injury to her back and legs in July 1991 that rendered her unable to return to work until November 1991. W.W.C. Bingo v. Zwierzynski, 53 Ark. App. 288, 921 S.W.2d 954 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the underlying condition causing disability has become more stable and if nothing further in the way of treatment will improve that condition, the healing period for which an employee is entitled to temporary total disability benefits is ended.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission did not err in awarding temporary total disability benefits to employee for a cervical spine injury after she had injured her back as the finding that employee's healing period had not ended was supported by substantial evidence. Searcy Indus. Laundry, Inc. v. Ferren, 92 Ark. App. 65, 211 S.W.3d 11 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where appellant employee reported that he sustained a second back injury at work, two MRIs indicated that there were no new objective findings and the record contained competing opinions between physicians. The Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission chose to credit those which indicated that there were no objective findings of injury; the Commission's decision denying medical and temporary-total disability benefits was supported by substantial evidence.
   Lamb v. Norac Co., 2009 Ark. App. 730 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission had a substantial basis upon which to deny a claim for additional medical and temporary-total disability benefits because the workers'
   compensation benefits claimant underwent two MRIs, and there were new objective findings on the second MRI, according to the radiologist who reviewed both MRIs, and the doctor related claimant's need for treatment to the new injury; the Commission, reviewing the evidence de novo, found that no causal connection between the primary injury and the subsequent disability was shown, eliminating the need to address claimant's conduct.
   Griffith v. Medcath, Inc., 2009 Ark. App. 777 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not require for a permanent-total-disability (PTD) determination, that a workers' compensation claimant have an impairment rating established by the medical evidence because the statute's plain language contained no such requirement. Thus, the court overruled its decision in Wren v. Sanders Plumbing Supply, 83 Ark. App. 111, 117 S.W.3d 657 (2003), to the extent that the decision held that without an impairment rating, a claimant was not entitled to permanent disability benefits or wage-loss benefits.
   Rutherford v. Mid-Delta Cmty. Servs., 102 Ark. App. 317, 285 S.W.3d 248 (2008), review denied, Rutherford v. Mid-Delta Cmty. Servs., Inc., — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Ark. LEXIS 507 (Jan. 30, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of permanent-total disability benefits to the employee was appropriate pursuant to subdivisions (e)(1) and (2) of this section because all of her physicians had returned her to work full-duty with no restrictions and no medical provider indicated that she was unable to work.
   Greenfield v. Conagra Foods, Inc., 2010 Ark. App. 292 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the denial of permanent total disability, as there was evidence of record that a claimant had transferrable work skills, motivation, and the ability to do some sedentary work.

      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in denying an employee's claim for permanent total disability benefits under subdivision (e)(1) of this section for carpal-tunnel syndrome because the Commission relied on both a functional capacity evaluation, which showed that the employee could do sedentary work, and the employee's college education; the employee could read, write, drive as needed, and perform limited household chores.
   Kirkendolph v. Department of Fin. & Admin., 2010 Ark. App. 786 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding that the cashier was not permanently and totally disabled under subdivision (e)(1) of this section and was not entitled to an ultrasound recommended by her physician was appropriate because the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission was permitted to determine the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. Regarding the ultrasound, it was within the province of the Commission to choose to attribute greater weight and credibility to the opinions of one doctor over another.

      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err under subdivision (e)(1) of this section in holding that an employee was not entitled to permanent total disability benefits for a spine injury; the employee had not made any effort to pursue vocational rehabilitation in order to go back to work, and the employee was still capable of participating in retail shopping and other daily activities.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in denying an employee's claim for permanent total disability benefits under subsection (e) of this section related to a back injury; the case turned on the Commission's evaluation of the weight and credibility of the evidence regarding the primary issue, the employee's ability to earn meaningful wages.
   Moore v. Ark. State Highway

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's denial of the worker's claim for permanent total disability for a back injury and the finding that he sustained only a 10 percent wage loss turned on the Commission's assessment of witness credibility and the weight of the evidence, and the denial had a substantial basis, but the wage-loss issue was remanded in light of the reversal of the impairment rating; the Commission did not find that the worker was motivated to return to the workforce, and the Commission considered his age, education, work experience, and the nature of the injury.
   Thompson v. Mt. Home Good Samaritan Vill., 2014 Ark. App. 493, 442 S.W.3d 873 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly found that an employee failed to prove permanent total disability or entitlement to a greater amount of wage-loss benefits; while he was 57 years old, had not completed the 11th grade, and did not have skills transferable into the light category of work, his true functional capacity level was unknown. The employee gave unreliable effort in the examination and his statements to his doctors and a vocational rehabilitation counselor showed his lack of motivation to return to work, which impeded the Commission's ability to assess the full extent of the employee's current wage-earning capacity.
   Stauber v. City of North Little Rock, 2015 Ark. App. 54 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that a claimant failed to prove that the claimant was permanently and totally disabled; despite the treating physician's belief that the claimant was totally disabled, the claimant was very intelligent and had transferable and marketable skills that did not involve physically demanding activities and the record was devoid of any physical limitations being placed on the claimant by any of his treating surgeons.
   Nichols v. Micro Plastics, Inc., 2015 Ark. App. 134 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that a claimant was not permanently and totally disabled, but sustained wage-loss disability in the amount of 35% as a result of a shoulder injury because the claimant made no effort to find a job or return to the workforce and no treating physician opined that the claimant was unable to resume any gainful employment. Furthermore, the Commission did not find credible that the claimant was confined to the claimant's bedroom as a result of the injury.
   Schall v. Univ. of Ark. for Med. Sciences, 2017 Ark. App. 50, 510 S.W.3d 302 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision denying an employee permanent and total disability benefits where no physician had opined that the employee was permanently and totally disabled, he had returned to light-duty work, the employee was able to drive and care for himself, and there were potential jobs that were not physically demanding.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's opinion that the employee suffered compensable mental injuries and that the continued treatment of those injuries was reasonable and necessary was supported by substantial evidence; the employee's medical records noted a depressed mood immediately following his compensable injury.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission's finding that an employee established by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to benefits for permanent total disability was supported by substantial evidence because the medical opinions showed that the employee was either completely disabled or, at the very least, had no use of his right arm.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that an employee was not permanently and totally disabled where the employee testified that he was able to drive, perform household chores, and cook for himself, the employee graduated from high school, and after considering his physical limitations, two vocational rehabilitation assessments identified potential jobs for him in the area.

       Partial disability decision by the Arkansas Workers'

       The wage-loss factor rather than the functional or anatomical loss is controlling in disability determinations which are to be made by the commission on the basis of medical evidence, age, education, experience and other matters reasonably expected to affect the claimant's earning power. Rooney v. Charles, 262 Ark. 695, 560 S.W.2d 797 (1978); City of Fayetteville v. Guess, 10 Ark. App. 313, 663 S.W.2d 946 (1984); Perry v. Mar-Bax Shirt Co., 16 Ark. App. 133, 698 S.W.2d 302 (1985).

       A worker may be entitled to additional wage loss disability even though his wages remain the same or increase after the injury. City of Fayetteville v. Guess, 10 Ark. App. 313, 663 S.W.2d 946 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant was within the odd-lot category of workers. Moser v. Arkansas Lime Co., 40 Ark. App. 113, 846 S.W.2d 188 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that, in scheduled injury cases, the nature of the injury is fixed, the finding of permanent and total disability under such circumstances necessarily hinges on factors which bear on the claimant's age, education, experience, and other matters affecting wage loss. Moser v. Arkansas Lime Co., 40 Ark. App. 113, 846 S.W.2d 188 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employers are on notice that an employee with a scheduled injury who claims to be permanently and totally disabled will necessarily be presenting proof of wage-loss factors such a mental capacity, education, training, or age, and that a sufficient showing by the claimant will require that the employer show that suitable work is available on a regular and continuous basis; therefore, employer who knew that employee was making a claim for total and permanent disability prior to a hearing was on notice that the odd-lot doctrine was at issue. Moser v. Arkansas Lime Co., 40 Ark. App. 113, 846 S.W.2d 188 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining benefits for a claimant who was employed by two employers in the capacity of a joint employee and who was only working one forty-hour work week, although employee was receiving a check from both employers for the same work week, the commission concluded that claimant was entitled to idemnity benefits based upon his combined wages. Cook v. Recovery Corp., 50 Ark. App. 49, 900 S.W.2d 212 (1995), aff'd, 322 Ark. 707, 911 S.W.2d 581 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Court of Appeals, Division Four, holds that a claimant with a scheduled injury is not entitled to permanent partial disability benefits, and this applies whether the claimant is seeking benefits from an employer, an insurer, or the Arkansas Second Injury Fund. Therefore, a claimant, who lost four fingers in an accident, was unable to obtain wage-loss disability over and above the impairment rating to her hand based on a previous diagnosis of foot ulcers, even if the Fund was liable.
   Crelia v. Rheem Mfg. Co., 99 Ark. App. 73, 257 S.W.3d 115 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the Workers'
   Compensation Commission that an employee suffered only a 20 percent reduction in earning capacity because the evidence demonstrated that the employee sustained more than a 20 percent wage loss when comparing the wages paid for a press operator job and the subsequent light work the employer offered.

       Workers'
   compensation claimant was properly awarded a 25% wage loss disability in excess of his permanent partial impairment given the fact-intensive inquiry; the Workers'
   Compensation Commission recognized that the claimant was middle-aged, had work experience primarily in the manual labor fields, but also noted that functional evaluations over the years showed his capacity to work in light duty with lifting restrictions.

       The term temporary partial disability refers to the phase of permanent partial disability where the employee, although able to work at some gainful occupation, is still suffering from the effects of the injury, which effects may reasonably be anticipated to disappear within the time fixed for compensation. Anchor Constr. Co. v. Rice, 252 Ark. 460, 479 S.W.2d 573 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary total disability is that period within the healing period in which the employee suffers a total incapacity to earn wages while temporary partial disability is that period within the healing period in which the employee suffers only a decrease in his capacity to earn the wages he was receiving at the time of the injury. Arkansas State Highway & Transp. Dep't v. Breshears, 272 Ark. 244, 613 S.W.2d 392 (Ark. 1981).

       Workers'
   compensation commission did not err in affirming the denial of additional benefits for lower back injuries the claimant claimed were caused by a 1998 work-related foot accident because, inter alia, the claimant had been in a motor vehicle accident in 1999 and, two-and-one-half years after his injury an emergency room report indicated that the claimant's back pain and history of complaints had begun just two weeks earlier.

      <p>
       Workers'
   compensation commission did not err in finding that the claimant failed to prove that his depression was a result of his compensable right-foot injury in 1998 because the claimant's psychological complaints did not appear in medical records until 2002 a clinic note of February 21, 2001 stated that the claimant did not suffer from psychological problems, and on September 4, 2001, the doctor assigned the claimant a permanent physical impairment rating and stated that he had reached maximum medical improvement.

      <p>
       Workers'
   compensation commission did not err in finding that the claimant failed to prove that a pain pump recommended by his treating physician was reasonably necessary for treatment of his compensable injuries; the commission pointed to the claimant's testimony that he was not sure whether he even wanted the pain pump, and it found that he had failed to prove that the pump was for treatment of the 1998 compensable work-related injury to his right lower extremity.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   compensation commission did not err in affirming the denial of additional benefits for the period from January 28, 2002, until an undetermined date because a doctor's report of September 4, 2001 stated that the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement for his compensable right-foot injury in 1998, and there was no indication subsequent to that date that he re-entered his healing period or suffered a total incapacity to earn wages as a result of the injury.
   Murphy v. Forsgren, Inc., 99 Ark. App. 223, 258 S.W.3d 794 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision to deny an employee temporary-partial-disability benefits and temporary-total-disability benefits because the employer paid the employee temporary-total-disability benefits through December 31, 2007, and a doctor concluded that the employee had reached maximum medical improvement on November 1, 2007; relying on the doctor's opinion, the Commission found that the employee was not entitled to any further temporary-disability benefits beyond November 1, 2007, and the doctor's provided substantial support for the Commission's decision.

       Workers'
   compensation claimant's separation of powers argument failed because he did not show that the administrative law judge (ALJ) who decided his case was under pressure or biased in anyway against the claimant because, inter alia, he failed to establish that the ALJ who heard his case was subject to the pressures that had allegedly been exerted by the executive branch against law judges at an earlier time.

       This section contemplates a situation in which an employee returns to work but, because of a temporary-partial disability, is not earning the same wages as before the injury; where § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-526" target="_self">11-9-526</a></cite> bars a claimant from receiving temporary-total-disability benefits for a designated period of time because of a refusal to accept suitable employment that is within the claimant's capacity to perform, the same rationale applies to bar the claimant from receiving temporary-partial disability. Therefore, in a case where a claimant refused to accept work within her capability at a medical clinic or in a laundry room after she suffered a compensable shoulder and neck injury, she was unable to receive temporary-partial disability.

       The wage-loss factor rather than the functional or anatomical loss is controlling in disability determinations which are to be made by the commission on the basis of medical evidence, age, education, experience and other matters reasonably expected to affect the claimant's earning power. Rooney v. Charles, 262 Ark. 695, 560 S.W.2d 797 (1978); City of Fayetteville v. Guess, 10 Ark. App. 313, 663 S.W.2d 946 (1984); Perry v. Mar-Bax Shirt Co., 16 Ark. App. 133, 698 S.W.2d 302 (1985).

       Scheduled injuries differ from unscheduled injuries in that the award for a scheduled injury generally is limited to the benefits provided for that particular scheduled injury. Moser v. Arkansas Lime Co., 40 Ark. App. 113, 846 S.W.2d 188 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee who has suffered a scheduled injury is to receive temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits during his healing period or until he returns to work, regardless of whether he has demonstrated that he is actually incapacitated from earning wages.

      <p>
       An award of a 20 percent wage-loss disability, with the Second Injury Fund to pay half, was proper following a 1995 injury which itself resulted in an impairment rating of only 2 percent. Second Injury Fund v. Stephens, 62 Ark. App. 255, 970 S.W.2d 331 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant was entitled to temporary disability benefits as claimant showed he sustained a scheduled injury, was in a “healing period” even though his doctor did not use that precise term, and should not be penalized for staying on the job and working through the pain after the employer refused to provide medical treatment for his leg injury sustained on the job, as the claimant did not “return to work” in such a way that benefits should be terminated. Farmers Coop. v. Biles, 77 Ark. App. 1, 69 S.W.3d 899 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   compensation claimant was not statutorily barred from receiving temporary total or partial disability, under this section, because he undisputedly remained in his healing period and continued to work light duty and because there was no substantial evidence of unjustifiable refusal to work, such that § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-526" target="_self">11-9-526</a></cite> would have been triggered.
   Walker v. Cooper Auto., 289 S.W.3d 184 (2008).

      <p>
       Pursuant to § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-526" target="_self">11-9-526</a></cite>, an employee with a knee injury who refused light duty work offered to him by his employer following surgery on the knee was not entitled to temporary total disability (TTD) benefits because, under subsection (a) of this section, the failure to return to work must have been causally related to the injury.

      </p>
      <p>
       The term compensation as used in this section refers to money benefits paid to the injured employee for disability. Brooks v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., 247 Ark. 61, 444 S.W.2d 246 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant sustained a compensable injury while working at one job, his compensation benefits were properly based on wages from that job rather than on the combined incomes of that job and another job held by claimant. Hart's Exxon Serv. Station v. Prater, 268 Ark. 961, 597 S.W.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a scheduled injury cannot be apportioned to the body as a whole absent total disability, a claimant who has received a scheduled injury can receive additional compensation for an injury which is found to be attributable to the scheduled injury. Milburn v. Concrete Fabricators, Inc., 18 Ark. App. 23, 709 S.W.2d 822 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       For a scheduled injury, absent a finding of permanent total disability, the award is limited to the benefits provided for that scheduled injury. Rash v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 18 Ark. App. 248, 715 S.W.2d 449 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation for an injury scheduled in this section is payable to the injured worker without regard to subsequent earning capacity; these benefits are awarded more in the nature of an indemnity for physical or functional loss and are payable whether the worker is employed or unemployed and irrespective of what his wages or earning capacity may be. Rash v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 18 Ark. App. 248, 715 S.W.2d 449 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in overturning an award of temporary total disability benefits where, due to the fact that employee suffered from a scheduled injury, she was not required to show that she was totally incapacitated from working, only that she had not returned to work because she remained in her healing period.

       Where medical testimony fixed functional loss of use at 10 percent, claimant's testimony could not be used by the commission as basis for increasing the percentage of functional loss from 10 percent to 35 percent. Springdale Farms v. McGarrah, 260 Ark. 483, 541 S.W.2d 928 (1976).

      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Workers' Compensation Commission's finding that the employee had not returned to work; the employee repeatedly attempted to work and repeatedly required additional care and treatment and specific medical evidence indicated that her continued treatment for the compensable injury was required past the date of her termination by the employer. Poulan Weed Eater v. Marshall, 79 Ark. App. 129, 84 S.W.3d 878 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's finding on permanent impairment was supported by substantial evidence as the claimant's treating physician found he had an 88% impairment under the American Medical Association Guides, and the claimant testified that he did have some functional use of his left arm.

      <p>
       Partial permanent impairments to the eyes come within the scheduled injury category as set out in subsection (f); claimants are limited to the scheduled benefits, and such benefits cannot be increased by considering wage-loss factors absent a finding of permanent total disability. Federal Compress & Whse. Co. v. Risper, 55 Ark. App. 300, 935 S.W.2d 279 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on an ophthalmologist's testimony, there was substantial evidence to support the Workers' Compensation Commission's finding that a claimant was entitled to a 100% loss of vision to the claimant's left eye. However, the Commission erred in converting the claimant's impairment to the body as a whole; because the impairment to the claimant's left eye came within the scheduled-injury category, the claimant was limited to the scheduled benefits.

       Courts must adhere to legislative decision to adopt rigid rule that absent a showing of total disability a scheduled injury cannot be apportioned to the body as a whole; accordingly, commission did not err in refusing to reopen record to receive additional evidence concerning degree to which foot injury caused disability to body as a whole.

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly denied a workers'
   compensation claimant temporary total disability benefits after the claimant was terminated for insubordination as under subsection (a) of this section, whether the claimant was within the healing period was irrelevant as the claimant had returned to light-duty work.

      </p>
      <p>
       Benefits claimant was not entitled to additional temporary total disability benefits under subsection (a) of this section because the evidence did not support an argument that the claimant was still in a healing period two years after her original compensable injuries or that she had reentered a healing period; the claimant reached maximum medical improvement by August 6, 2010, and her continued complaints were too diffuse and unsupported by corroborating clinical findings to suggest otherwise. By the time the claimant sought unauthorized treatment, her residual symptoms were attributed to de Quervain's Tenosynovitis, which could not have been pinpointed to a particular cause, the claimant's own testimony supporting the finding that she had reached the end of her healing period for her left upper extremity, and the claimant abandoned her light-duty employment for reasons unrelated to her compensable hand injuries.

       Appellate review was not possible because it was unclear whether the Workers'
   Compensation Commission determined that a benefits claimant remained in his healing period or started a new healing period, whether he suffered a total incapacity to earn a meaningful wage, whether he returned to work within the meaning of this section, whether his absenteeism was related to a compensable knee injury, and whether violations of the attendance policy did or did not affect temporary total disability eligibility under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-526" target="_self">11-9-526</a></cite>.

       Decision awarding a claimant temporary total disability (TTD) benefits was reversed and remanded where the administrative law judge (ALJ) clearly analyzed the claimant's entitlement to TTD benefits under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-526" target="_self">11-9-526</a></cite>, it was undisputed that the claimant's injury was a scheduled injury, and neither the Workers’ Compensation Commission nor the ALJ made any findings with regard to the requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

       Total permanent disability may be paid notwithstanding compensation was received for specific loss under this section. McNeely v. Clem Mill & Gin Co., 241 Ark. 498, 409 S.W.2d 502 (1966); Cooper Indus. Prods., Inc. v. Worth, 256 Ark. 394, 508 S.W.2d 59 (1974); Johnson Constr. Co. v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in interpreting §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-521ol1g" target="_self">11-9-521(g)</a></cite> and -519(b) as barring an employee, who suffered a fifty-percent impairment to his left lower extremity, from recovering permanent total disability benefits because he had suffered a scheduled compensable injury to his right leg. In finding that a scheduled-injury claimant was prohibited from entitlement to permanent total disability benefits in excess of the percentage of his physical impairment and that such a claim had to meet the multiple-loss requirements, the Commission impermissibly expanded the statutory prohibition of a claim for permanent partial disability benefits except in a case of multiple losses.
   McDonald v. Batesville Poultry Equip., 90 Ark. App. 435, 206 S.W.3d 908 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of a claimant's claim for permanent-total-disability benefits was appropriate because substantial evidence supported the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's decision that the claimant's right hand was functional and that the claimant could participate in gainful employment. The Commission found that the claimant's unreliable effort and magnified symptoms during testing were entitled to significant weight.

        Wage Earning Loss.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The commission cannot consider a wage earning loss in addition to the functional loss in fixing partial loss or partial loss of use of a limb under this section. Anchor Constr. Co. v. Rice, 252 Ark. 460, 479 S.W.2d 573 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an injury scheduled under this section is involved, it is immaterial that the claimant has suffered no loss of earnings. International Paper Co. v. Remley, 256 Ark. 7, 505 S.W.2d 219 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The wage-loss factor rather than the functional or anatomical loss is controlling in disability determinations which are to be made by the commission on the basis of medical evidence, age, education, experience and other matters reasonably expected to affect the claimant's earning power. Rooney v. Charles, 262 Ark. 695, 560 S.W.2d 797 (1978); City of Fayetteville v. Guess, 10 Ark. App. 313, 663 S.W.2d 946 (1984); Perry v. Mar-Bax Shirt Co., 16 Ark. App. 133, 698 S.W.2d 302 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule in this state is that a claimant sustaining a scheduled injury is limited to the applicable allowances set forth in this section and the benefits cannot be increased by considering wage loss factors absent a finding of permanent total disability. Taylor v. Pfeiffer Plumbing & Heating Co., 8 Ark. App. 144, 648 S.W.2d 526 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that, in scheduled injury cases, the nature of the injury is fixed, the finding of permanent and total disability under such circumstances necessarily hinges on factors which bear on the claimant's age, education, experience, and other matters affecting wage loss. Moser v. Arkansas Lime Co., 40 Ark. App. 113, 846 S.W.2d 188 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Court of Appeals, Division Four, holds that a claimant with a scheduled injury is not entitled to permanent partial disability benefits, and this applies whether the claimant is seeking benefits from an employer, an insurer, or the Arkansas Second Injury Fund. Therefore, a claimant, who lost four fingers in an accident, was unable to obtain wage-loss disability over and above the impairment rating to her hand based on a previous diagnosis of foot ulcers, even if the Fund was liable.
   Crelia v. Rheem Mfg. Co., 99 Ark. App. 73, 257 S.W.3d 115 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence did not support an award of only 20-percent wage-loss disability, because at the time of the work-related injury the employee was making $67,721.07, and the evidence clearly showed that the most the employee would be able to make as a social worker or in one of the sedentary jobs found by the disability insurer was $35,000 per year, an amount significantly less than the employee's pre-injury earnings.

       Subsection (b) does not violate U.S. Const. Amend. 14 as the legislature was attempting to prevent the employer from being liable for benefits for the loss of the ability to earn wages while the injured employee is actually earning wages equal to the wages he was earning at the time of his injury, and that is a legitimate governmental objective. Cook v. ALCOA, 35 Ark. App. 16, 811 S.W.2d 329 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (f) of this section does not violate the Equal Protection Clause; the classification between those workers aged sixty-five and older, who are receiving or who are eligible to receive public or private retirement benefits, and all other workers, is not arbitrary and capricious. Golden v. Westark Community College, 58 Ark. App. 209, 948 S.W.2d 108 (1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 333 Ark. 41, 969 S.W.2d 154 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 11-9-101 and subsection (f) of this section restate the goals of avoiding duplicate payments and of curtailing the cost of workers' compensation insurance, which are legitimate governmental concerns. Golden v. Westark Community College, 58 Ark. App. 209, 948 S.W.2d 108 (1997), aff'd in part, reversed in part, 333 Ark. 41, 969 S.W.2d 154 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (f) of this section violates the equal protection clause of the federal constitution because the justification for the age-based classification for groups receiving both workers' compensation benefits and social security retirement benefits is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. Golden v. Westark Community College, 333 Ark. 41, 969 S.W.2d 154 (1998) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in holding that subdivision (f)(1) of this section was constitutional where the statute created a ceasing point for permanently totally disabled (PTD) benefits so that older workers who were eligible for social security or retirement benefits were foreclosed from receiving PTD for a legitimate work-related injury; there was no rational basis for such a distinction.

The Commission's accounting of these additional factors that could reasonably affect the employee's future earning capacity supported the twenty-percent award.

The employee gave unreliable effort in the examination and his statements to his doctors and a vocational rehabilitation counselor showed his lack of motivation to return to work, which impeded the Commission's ability to assess the full extent of the employee's current wage-earning capacity.

Furthermore, the Commission did not find credible that the claimant was confined to the claimant's bedroom as a result of the injury.

       Although appellants contended that claimant, a network support engineer, was barred from wage-loss disability benefits as he chose to retire only a few hours after reporting to work, the Workers’ Compensation Commission credited claimant's testimony that the ultimate reason for retiring was the increase in pain and the “dumbfoundedness” he experienced when back on the job and this testimony was corroborated; as it is the Commission's duty to weigh the evidence and not the appellate court, the Commission's decision that claimant was entitled to 50% wage-loss disability benefits was affirmed.

Standard Gravel Co., 68 Ark. App. 162, 5 S.W.3d 478 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite his argument that he made a prima facie case of entitlement to permanent total disability benefits under the former odd-lot doctrine, where claimant's treating physicians opined that the claimant could perform light duty work, the Commission was correct to find that he was not totally disabled. Nelson v. Timberline Int'l, 57 Ark. App. 34, 942 S.W.2d 260 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The odd lot doctrine did not apply to a claimant who, at the time he reached his maximum medical improvement, was a 28 year old high school graduate who could, according to the functional capacity assessment, perform, at a minimum, six out of every ten available jobs on the market. Goodwin v. Phillips Petro. Co., 72 Ark. App. 302, 37 S.W.3d 644 (2001).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The commission's finding with respect to subsection (b), that a claimant who has once returned to work at equal or greater wages is permanently barred from receiving benefits for a loss in wage earning capacity, even should her subsequent employment cease, unless the claimant is terminated for reasons relating to her compensable injury, was erroneous. Belcher v. Holiday Inn, 43 Ark. App. 157, 868 S.W.2d 87 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee was properly awarded 10 percent permanent wage loss disability because while the employee returned to work as a truck driver following back surgery, that did not forever foreclose the employee from wage-loss disability benefits under subdivision (b)(2) of this section as the employee's return to work aggravated the employee's condition to the extent that the employee could no longer work.
   Enter. Prods. Co. v. Leach, 2009 Ark. App. 148, 316 S.W.3d 253 (2009).

      </p>

       Where an employee has had good results from a hernia operation and where his total disability results from his susceptibility to the recurrence of the hernia, he is not entitled to benefits for total disability under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-519" target="_self">11-9-519</a></cite> of this section, but is limited to the benefits provided by the hernia provision in this section.

      <p>
       Claimant was not entitled to receive permanent disability benefits because of infections and complications resulting from his hernia surgeries where the medical evidence presented did not indicate that the claimant's failure to heal promptly caused him to suffer any greater disability than any other person sustaining a severe hernia injury.

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       This chapter does not provide benefits for every injury sustained by an employee in the course of his employment; thus the statute provides no benefits in claims for hernia unless five different things are shown to the satisfaction of the commission.

      <p>
       Subdivision (a)(5) does not require claimant to prove that he actually was attended by physician within time period, but only that the distress following descent of the hernia was such as to require attendance of physician within time period.

       Commission could properly excuse failure of employee to go to doctor within the time period following the occurrence of the hernia where employee immediately reported his injury to his employer and employer asked employee to continue on light work and to go to a doctor in a day or two if he did not feel better.

       This section does not require claimant to prove he was actually attended by a physician within 72 hours after the injury; the statutory requirement is met if the evidence shows that within 72 hours after the injury the claimant's condition was such that he sought and needed the services of a physician. Ammons v. Meuwly Mach. Works, 266 Ark. 851, 587 S.W.2d 590 (1979); Brim v. Mid-Ark Truck Stop, 6 Ark. App. 119, 639 S.W.2d 75 (1982); Ayres v. Historic Preservation Assocs., 24 Ark.

       Where claimant told her employer that she had hurt her abdomen quite badly and that she needed to see a doctor about the injury but she could not afford to, the employer had an affirmative duty to send the claimant to a doctor to determine the extent of her injury, and therefore, the employer was estopped from insisting upon strict compliance with subdivision (a)(5). Brim v. Mid-Ark Truck Stop, 6 Ark. App. 119, 639 S.W.2d 75 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement that a claimant prove that he was actually attended by a physician within 72 hours but only that he needed the services of a physician during that period; a diagnosis of a hernia would confirm the need of the services of a physician. Osceola Foods, Inc. v. Andrew, 14 Ark. App. 95, 685 S.W.2d 813 (1985).

       Evidence insufficient to find claimant's injury caused her to cease work immediately. Bottoms Baptist Orphanage v. Johnson, 240 Ark. 175, 398 S.W.2d 544 (1966); Haygood v.

       The causal connection between work strain and a hernia should not be determined by mathematical formulas or measured by minutes or hours; it should be based on evidence which satisfies the finder of fact that the cessation from work became necessary soon enough after the trauma to establish that there was a causal connection under the circumstances of the case. Osceola Foods, Inc. v. Andrew, 14 Ark. App. 95, 685 S.W.2d 813 (1985); Ayres v. Historic Preservation Assocs., 24 Ark. App. 40, 747 S.W.2d 587 (1988).

       Claimant failed to provide clear proof of the exact mechanics of his fall, and the broad assumption by the administrative law judge that the claimant, who was morbidly obese, flipped in the air after being struck by a pipe on a forklift, did not meet the requirements of the statute, plus none of his treating physicians opined that the hernia was caused by a work-related accident; the finding that he failed to satisfy the statutory requirement that he prove that his hernia occurred immediately following his accident as a result of the application of force to his abdominal wall was affirmed.

       An injured employee would not be required to report a hernia within the 48 hour period where he did not know that he had received a hernia; however, he might still be required to report the injury.

       All of the requirements of this section were satisfied where claimant testified that he felt a burning pain in his side when he lifted a pallet (subdivision (a)(1)), claimant said that the pain “almost brought me to my knees” and that he stopped working in order to call his mother (subdivisions (a)(2) and (3)), claimant discussed his problem with a co-worker who was the wife of one of the company owners within forty-eight hours of the onset of the pain (subdivision (a)(4)), and where the physical distress required the attendance of a physician within the amount of time required by subdivision (a)(5), even though the physician was not actually seen within the seventy-two hour time frame (subdivision (a)(5)). Min-Ark Pallet Co. v. Lindsey, 58 Ark. App. 309, 950 S.W.2d 468 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was substantial evidence to show that the claimant did not meet the statutory notice requirements in relation to his new hernia condition where (1) on a day that he had a doctor's appointment related to a prior work-related hernia condition, he felt a sharp pain in his groin and thought he had reinjured his prior hernia, but then realized that his pain was coming from the other side, (2) he stopped working, mentioned the pain to his supervisor and asked to go to the company nurse's office to wait for a ride to his appointment, (3) as he sat in the nurse's office, he did not mention to the nurse that he had injured himself, (4) at his doctor's appointment, he informed the doctor that he felt a pain in his left side, and the doctor diagnosed a new hernia, but the claimant never informed the doctor that he had injured himself at work, and (5) the claimant did not report that his new hernia condition was was work-related until five days after the injury.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although claimant reported that his physical distress following the alleged occurrence of his hernia was such as to require the attendance of a licensed physician within 72 hours after the occurrence, as required by the statute, the undisputable fact was he did not seek medical treatment for almost a year following the accident, and he medical records did not support that his hernia-related symptoms were debilitating in the sense anticipated by the statute.

      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement that the “physical distress” caused by a hernia “shall be shown to the satisfaction of the commission,” which applies to each of the five subdivisions of subsection (a), refers to the Workers' Compensation Commission's own standard of review, which imposes upon that body the duty of making its findings in accordance with a preponderance of the evidence.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers's Compensation Commission erred in failing to find the claimant's hernia compensable and refusing to award benefits where the evidence was clear that the claimant suffered severe groin pain and other related symptoms only on April 13 and such injury satisfied all of the statutory requirements for compensability, notwithstanding that the claimant reported occurrences on both April 11 and April 13, and any April 11 injury did not satisfy the statutory requirements for compensability.

         The Second Injury Trust Fund established in this chapter is a special fund designed to ensure that an employer employing a worker with a disability will not, in the event that the worker suffers an injury on the job, be held liable for a greater disability or impairment than actually occurred while the worker was in his or her employment.
        </li>
        <li id="t11c09s11-9-525ol1a2">
         The employee is to be fully protected in that the fund pays the worker the difference between the employer's liability and the balance of his or her disability or impairment that results from all disabilities or impairments combined.
        </li>
        <li id="t11c09s11-9-525ol1a3">
         It is intended that latent conditions that are not known to the employee or employer not be considered previous disabilities or impairments which would give rise to a claim against the fund.

         Commencing January 1, 1981, all cases of permanent disability or impairment in which there has been previous disability or impairment shall be compensated as provided in this section.
        </li>
        <li id="t11c09s11-9-525ol1b2">
         Compensation shall be computed on the basis of the average earnings at the time of the last injury.
        </li>
        <li id="t11c09s11-9-525ol1b3">
         If any employee who has a permanent partial disability or impairment, whether from compensable injury or otherwise, receives a subsequent compensable injury resulting in additional permanent partial disability or impairment so that the degree or percentage of disability or impairment caused by the combined disabilities or impairments is greater than that which would have resulted from the last injury, considered alone and of itself, and if the employee is entitled to receive compensation on the basis of combined disabilities or impairments, then the employer at the time of the last injury shall be liable only for the degree or percentage of disability or impairment that would have resulted from the last injury had there been no preexisting disability or impairment.
        </li>
        <li id="t11c09s11-9-525ol1b4">
         After the compensation liability of the employer for the last injury, considered alone, which shall be no greater than the actual anatomical impairment resulting from the last injury, has been determined by an administrative law judge or the Workers' Compensation Commission, the degree or percentage of employee's disability that is attributable to all injuries or conditions existing at the time the last injury was sustained shall then be determined by the administrative law judge or the commission, and the degree or percentage of disability or impairment that existed prior to the last injury plus the disability or impairment resulting from the combined disability shall be determined, and compensation for that balance, if any, shall be paid out of the fund provided for in § 11-9-301.
        </li>
        <li id="t11c09s11-9-525ol1b5">
         If the previous disability or impairment, whether from compensable injury or otherwise, and the last injury together result in permanent total disability, the employer at the time of the last injury shall be liable only for the actual anatomical impairment resulting from the last injury considered alone and of itself. However, if the compensation for which the employer at the time of the last injury is liable is less than the compensation provided in §§ 11-9-501 — 11-9-506 for permanent total disability, then, in addition to the compensation for which the employer is liable and after the completion of payment of compensation by the employer, the employee shall be paid the remainder of the compensation that would be due for permanent total disability under §§ 11-9-501 — 11-9-506 out of the fund.

        <li id="t11c09s11-9-525ol1b6">
         The Treasurer of State shall be the custodian of the fund, and any interest accruing shall be added thereto.

       Statutes limiting recovery for permanent total disability resulting from a second injury while working for the same employer, but leaving open ended the recovery for permanent total disability from a single injury are not unconstitutional as an unreasonable classification, since the purpose is to encourage employers to retain injured employees.

       Second Injury Fund liability is premised on the fact that the prior disability is in esse at the time of employment and is neither caused nor contributed to by the employment. Prier Brass v. Weller, 23 Ark. App. 193, 745 S.W.2d 647 (1988).

       The term compensation as used in this section refers to money benefits paid to the injured employee for disability. Brooks v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., 247 Ark. 61, 444 S.W.2d 246 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Impairment means loss of earning capacity due to a nonwork-related condition. Osage Oil Co. v. Rogers, 15 Ark. App. 319, 692 S.W.2d 786 (1985). But see Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988); State Treasurer, Second Injury Fund v. Coleman, 16 Ark. App. 188, 699 S.W.2d 401 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “impairment” no longer includes “non-work-related condition”; there seems to be no real justification for limiting “impairment” to a non-work-related condition. White Consol. v. Rooney, 44 Ark. App. 78, 866 S.W.2d 838 (1993), aff'd, Second Injury Trust Fund v. White Consol., 317 Ark. 26, 875 S.W.2d 834 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature added the words “or impairment” to make it clear that “non-work-related” conditions were included; by implication, at least, this suggests that “work-related” conditions were already included in the term “disability.” White Consol. v. Rooney, 44 Ark. App. 78, 866 S.W.2d 838 (1993), aff'd, Second Injury Trust Fund v. White Consol., 317 Ark. 26, 875 S.W.2d 834 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A preexisting impairment under subdivision (b)(5) of this section can be either work related or non-work related. Second Injury Trust Fund v. POM, Inc., 316 Ark. 796, 875 S.W.2d 832 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defining “impairment” to necessarily include wage loss is wrong since it would undermine the purpose of the Second Injury Trust Fund to encourage the hiring of handicapped persons. Second Injury Trust Fund v. POM, Inc., 316 Ark. 796, 875 S.W.2d 832 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “impairment” in subdivision (b)(5) of this section is not limited to a condition resulting from a previous injury which caused wage loss, and thus the Second Injury Fund may be liable for a portion of a worker's total disability when permanent total disability results from a second injury to one who suffered “impairment” from a previous injury which did not result in wage loss when it occurred. Second Injury Trust Fund v. White Consol., 317 Ark. 26, 875 S.W.2d 834 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In construing statutes relating to the Second Injury Fund, the appellate court will interpret them strictly in light of the limited and restricted nature of the Fund and the need to ensure its solvency. Stucco, Inc. v. Rose, 52 Ark. App. 42, 914 S.W.2d 767 (1996), rev'd, Stucco Plus v. Rose, 327 Ark. 314, 938 S.W.2d 556 (Ark. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant has a preexisting injury and incurs a subsequent injury entitling him to total disability benefits, the employer's liability for the claimant's benefits is limited to the subsequent injury alone, and thus its liability is at the permanent partial disability rate. Stucco Plus v. Rose, 327 Ark. 314, 938 S.W.2d 556 (Ark. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-1001" target="_self">11-9-1001</a></cite> discourages judicial lawmaking and because the Court of Appeals must defer to decisions of the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court could not broaden the scope of workers' compensation law so that the Second Injury Fund would become liable for wage-loss disability benefits payable to a disabled worker in the event of successive injuries during the same employment. Maxey v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 341 Ark. 306, 18 S.W.3d 328 (2000).

      <p>
       The purpose of the Second Injury Fund is to encourage the employment of handicapped workers by providing that in the event of injury to those workers the employer will not have to pay for any more disability than actually occurred in his employment, and the purpose is not to give a windfall or subsidy to those employers. Osage Oil Co. v. Rogers, 15 Ark. App. 319, 692 S.W.2d 786 (1985). But see Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988).

       The first two sentences of this section expressly state the purposes of the Second Injury Fund statute to limit the employer's liability and simultaneously fully protect an already handicapped employee where he is subsequently injured on the job. State Treasurer, Second Injury Fund v. Coleman, 16 Ark. App. 188, 699 S.W.2d 401 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this section is to ensure that an employer employing a handicapped worker will not be required to pay for a greater amount of disability or impairment than that which the worker sustains while in the employment of that employer. Second Injury Fund v. McCarver, 17 Ark. App. 101, 704 S.W.2d 639, aff'd, 289 Ark. 509, 715 S.W.2d 429 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Stretching this section to assume liability for part of the disability or impairment sustained by a handicapped worker while in an employer's employment relieves that employer of part of his statutory liability and grants him a windfall of subsidy; it was not the legislature's intent to give employers that type of encouragement to hire or retain handicapped or injured workers. Second Injury Fund v. McCarver, 17 Ark. App. 101, 704 S.W.2d 639, aff'd, 289 Ark. 509, 715 S.W.2d 429 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The very purpose of the Second Injury Fund is to provide relief to an employer who hires a person with prior impairment so that the employer is not to be held responsible for more disability than that caused by that workplace. Prier Brass v. Weller, 23 Ark. App. 193, 745 S.W.2d 647 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The underlying purpose of this section is to limit the employer's liability to the amount of disability or impairment suffered by the employee during his employment with that employer, and to thereby encourage hiring of the handicapped.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Fund was created by the General Assembly to see to it that a subsequent employer does not become responsible for disability of an employee when a part of his or her condition results from an injury which occurred in previous employment with a different employer.

      <p>
       Second injury compensation provisions do not apply where previous injuries had not contributed to the final permanent total disability. Cooper Indus. Prods., Inc. v. Worth, 256 Ark. 394, 508 S.W.2d 59 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for the second injury provision to apply, it must be found that the previous injury or injuries, combined with a second injury, caused the disability complained of. Wooten v. Mohawk Rubber Co., 259 Ark. 837, 536 S.W.2d 734 (1976); Nall v. Maynard, 271 Ark. 643, 609 S.W.2d 352 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not apply to injury which occurred prior to the effective date of this section. A.O. Smith-Inland, Inc. v. Dodd, 15 Ark. App. 108, 690 S.W.2d 367 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Second Injury Fund is not liable when an employee sustains a second injury while still working for the employer in whose employment he or she sustained the first injury. McCarver v. Second Injury Fund, 289 Ark. 509, 715 S.W.2d 429 (1986), overruled, Nelson v. Timberline Int'l, 332 Ark. 165, 964 S.W.2d 357 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       If successive injuries in the same employment cause total and permanent disability, the employer or his or her insurance carrier is responsible to the employee for all benefits; however, if the previous disability or impairment does not arise out of the employment by the same employer, the Second Injury Fund must pay the benefits. Riceland Foods, Inc. v. Second Injury Fund, 289 Ark. 528, 715 S.W.2d 432 (1986), overruled, Nelson v. Timberline Int'l, 332 Ark. 165, 964 S.W.2d 357 (1998); Death & Permanent Total Disability Trust Fund v. Whirlpool Corp., 39 Ark. App. 62, 837 S.W.2d 293 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability of the Second Injury Fund comes into question only after three hurdles have been overcome: (1) the employee must have suffered a compensable injury at his present place of employment; (2) prior to that injury the employee must have had a permanent partial disability or impairment; and (3) the disability or impairment must have combined with the recent compensable injury to produce the current disability status. Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the workers' compensation commission has made a determination of the existence of permanent partial disability, whether as a result of a hearing after the issues have been controverted or on a hearing to approve a joint petition, the issue is not subject to reexamination in the context of the Second Injury Fund statute. Arkansas Methodist Hosp. v. Adams, 43 Ark. App. 1, 858 S.W.2d 125 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to establish liability of the Second Injury Trust Fund, it is necessary to satisfy the three-part test set out in Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988). Bussell v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 48 Ark. App. 131, 891 S.W.2d 75 (1995); Hawkins Constr. v. Maxell, 52 Ark. App. 116, 915 S.W.2d 302 (1996), rev'd, 325 Ark. 133, 924 S.W.2d 789 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to subdivisions (3) and (4), the Second Injury Fund may be subjected to liability if a claimant suffers from a permanent impairment, whether or not the impairment is the result of a compensable injury; it is immaterial whether or not the impairment resulted in any wage-loss disability. Second Injury Fund v. Furman, 60 Ark. App. 237, 961 S.W.2d 787 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistent with the legislative intent to encourage employers to retain employees with disabilities or impairments resulting from a prior injury, the Second Injury Fund is liable for wage-loss benefits resulting from the cumulative effect of successive injures when the claimant sustains injuries in the same employment. Nelson v. Timberline Int'l, 332 Ark. 165, 964 S.W.2d 357 (1998).

       The full commission's reversal of an award by a referee for inadequacy with direction that the claimant return to a doctor for further treatment and that the matter of the termination of the healing period and the extent of the permanent partial disability be held in abeyance was justified where the medical testimony indicated need for further treatment.

      </p>

       In considering the question of Second Injury Fund liability, the claimant's former condition need not have met all elements of compensability under workers' compensation law, former condition and the recent compensable injury cannot both have occurred in the course of the employee's employment with the same employer.

       In cases where the medical testimony is so uncertain that it could clearly lead the finder of fact to either of two contrary conclusions, the courts will not reverse the commission, as the substantial evidence supports whichever determination it makes; accordingly, where medical evidence was equivocal as to whether claimant's disease was aggravated by a work-related accident, the court would not disturb commission's decision that there was no aggravation of a preexisting malady. Johnson v. Valmac Indus., 269 Ark. 626, 599 S.W.2d 440 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employee did not experience a decrease in his capacity to earn wages as a result of either his congenital condition or the previous pelvis fracture, there was substantial evidence to support the Workers' Compensation Commission's findings that the employee did not have an “impairment” within the meaning of this section prior to the compensable injury and that the Second Injury Fund was not liable for any of the benefits which were a consequence of the compensable injury. Del Monte Frozen Foods, Inc. v. Harmon, 19 Ark. App. 51, 716 S.W.2d 784 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission did not err in holding that worker's congenital dyslexia was not “a previous disability or impairment” which gives rise to a claim against the Second Injury Fund under this section, where the worker entered the labor market as an unskilled manual laborer, he was pursuing that employment without diminished earning capacity at the time of his injury, and there was no evidence that the claimant could not have continued in the same or similar employment at the same wage he had always earned had it not been for his injury. Holley Enters. v. Nicholls, 19 Ark. App. 97, 717 S.W.2d 495 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the fact finder may consider the final question of whether a claimant's former condition combined with a recent compensable injury to produce the current disability status, it must be determined whether the claimant's former condition constituted an “impairment.” In determining whether the claimant's former condition constituted an “impairment,” the question which would be posed in each case is: Is the physical quality of the claimant's former nonwork related condition such that, were all other elements of compensability present, it would be capable of supporting an award? Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was strong medical testimony showing that employee's first injury did not create a physical condition which contributed to the ultimate disability, it was permissible for the Commission to consider employee's lack of wage-loss disability as some corroboration of that medical testimony. POM, Inc. v. Taylor, 325 Ark. 334, 925 S.W.2d 790 (1996).

       The Second Injury Fund was liable for payment of wage-loss benefits where (1) all parties agreed that the claimant suffered a compensable injury, (2) the claimant was 8% permanently impaired prior to the compensable injury, and (3) the prior impairment combined with the compensable injury to produce the claimant's current disability status.

       The insurance carrier and the employer are the parties who benefit from Second Injury Fund involvement in appropriate cases, and it should be their responsibility to join the fund where their defense is based on the theory that an initial injury is contributing to the total amount of disability following the second injury.

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there were visible signs of the claimant's underlying disorder did not preclude a finding that the condition which disabled him was latent at the time of the injury. Until the injury, the claimant was able to perform normally, therefore the evidence supported a finding that, at the time of the injury, the full extent and nature of his childhood illness and its effect was not known to him or to his employer.

       As substantial evidence failed to support a finding that the substantial character or full extent of claimant's pulmonary disease was known when he suffered the second injury, his condition was latent and did not qualify as a prior disability or impairment which would trigger Second Injury Fund liability.

       If the second injury is recurrence of the original injury, compensation therefor must be paid by the employer and insurance carrier at the time of the first injury. Moss v. El Dorado Drilling Co., 237 Ark. 80, 371 S.W.2d 528 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       When symptoms of an injury persist and culminate in a second disability without the intervention of a new injury, the second disability is properly classified as a recurrence of the first injury and the insurance carrier and employer at the time of the original injury remain liable. Halstead Indus. v. Jones, 270 Ark. 85, 603 S.W.2d 456 (Ct. App. 1980); Allen Canning Co. v. McReynolds, 5 Ark. App. 78, 632 S.W.2d 450 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the second complication is found to be natural and probable result of the first injury, the employer remains liable and only where it is found that the second episode has resulted from an independent intervening cause is that liability affected. While there may be some variance in the words used to describe the principle, there has been no departure from the basic test, i.e., whether there is a causal connection between the two episodes. Bearden Lumber Co. v. Bond, 7 Ark. App. 65, 644 S.W.2d 321 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an accidental injury aggravates a prior one, the one in whose employ the second injury occurs is liable for all of the consequences naturally flowing from that incident; and it is only when the employee suffers merely a recurrence of a former injury without an intervening cause that the employer at the time of the initial injury is liable for the recurring disability. Bearden Lumber Co. v. Bond, 7 Ark. App. 65, 644 S.W.2d 321 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the second injury takes the form merely of a recurrence of the first, and if the second incident does not contribute even slightly to the causation of the disabling condition, the insurer on the risk at the time of the original injury remains liable for the second. Home Ins. Co. v. Meeker, 9 Ark. App. 201, 657 S.W.2d 215 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the logical consequences flowing from an initial injury are the responsibility of the carrier at the time of the initial incident. Where the second complication is a natural and probable result of the first injury it is deemed a recurrence and the original carrier remains liable. Only where it is found that a second episode has resulted from an independent intervening cause is liability imposed upon the second carrier. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Dunlap, 16 Ark. App. 51, 696 S.W.2d 771 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The test for liability of the Second Injury Fund is whether the prior impairment was effectively producing disability in the compensation sense (diminished earning capacity) before the accident and continued to do so afterwards. Masonite Corp. v. Mitchell, 16 Ark. App. 209, 699 S.W.2d 409 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission did not err in finding that employee was guilty of unreasonable conduct in connection with a work-related disability where employee's failure to wear his wrist splint, resulting in a second injury, constituted an independent intervening event relieving insurer of further liability. Broadway v. B.A.S.S., 41 Ark. App. 111, 848 S.W.2d 445 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for the Second Injury Fund to have liability, three prerequisites must be met: (1) the employee must have suffered a compensable injury at his present place of employment; (2) prior to that injury, the employee must have had a permanent partial disability or impairment; and (3) the disability or impairment must combine with the recent compensable injury to produce the current disability status. Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the more recent injury alone would have caused claimant's current disability status, the Second Injury Fund has no liability. Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prior condition need not cause a loss of wage-earning capacity in order to constitute an “impairment” and thereby meet the second prong of the test for Second Injury Fund liability. Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of prior “disability” is not a determining factor, but the extent of one's physical abilities prior to a compensable injury is not necessarily irrelevant to the decision whether the Second Injury Fund is liable. Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was evidence that although claimant sustained an injury in 1990, he had no surgery, he returned to the work force doing manual labor, and he had no problem doing his work until his injury more than two years later while working for the employer, claimant's preexisting disability and his most recent injury did not combine to produce a greater disability than would have been caused by the last injury considered alone. Hawkins Constr. v. Maxell, 52 Ark. App. 116, 915 S.W.2d 302 (1996), rev'd, 325 Ark. 133, 924 S.W.2d 789 (1996).

      <p>
       Where injury had resulted in no impairment of worker's earning capacity, the employer and its insurance carrier when the employee sustained a later, second injury were not entitled to claim any theory of apportionment to reduce the amount that worker was entitled to receive as the first attack had resulted in no impairment of earning capacity nor was it claimed as an industrial injury. Wilson Hargett Constr. Co. v. Holmes, 235 Ark. 698, 361 S.W.2d 634 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant was awarded permanent partial disability to the body as a whole for previous injuries, only an injury to the same part of the body would have any effect on a subsequent permanent partial disability to the body as a whole, the previous award for the similar injury being deducted.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant had suffered two injuries to the same area, the case was remanded to the commission for a determination of the degree of disability suffered by the claimant as a result of her first injury and for the degree of disability that would have resulted from her subsequent injury if the previous disability, if any, had not existed. Gibson's Disct. Ctr. v. Bornmann, 252 Ark. 24, 477 S.W.2d 171 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee accident created permanent partial disability and a second accident with another employer increased that disability, the second employer was responsible for only that portion of the disability created by the second accident. International Paper Co. v. Remley, 256 Ark. 7, 505 S.W.2d 219 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment does not apply unless the prior impairment was independently causing disability prior to the second injury and continues to operate as such after the accident; the fact that the prior disability was not job related and did not arise out of or in the course of a covered employment does not affect the duty to apportion. Harrison Furn. v. Chrobak, 2 Ark. App. 364, 620 S.W.2d 955 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' Compensation Commission erred in holding that apportionment was not authorized on the grounds that the employee's preexisting disability resulted from a congenital abnormality and was not work related, since there is no requirement that the first injury be a compensable one before apportionment will apply and since the prior impairment was independently causing disability prior to the second injury and continued to do so after the accident. Harrison Furn. v. Chrobak, 2 Ark. App. 364, 620 S.W.2d 955 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       While apportionment does not depend upon the preexisting disability being job related, apportionment does not apply unless the prior impairment was independently causing disability prior to the second injury and continued to do so after that injury.

      </p>
      <p>
       Application of the doctrine of apportionment requires a finding that there was a second episode resulting from an independent intervening cause. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Dunlap, 16 Ark. App. 51, 696 S.W.2d 771 (1985).
      </p>

       In order to be apportionable under subsections (a) and (b), the condition must have been independently causing a disability prior to the second injury and continue to do so after the second injury. State Treasurer, Second Injury Fund v. Coleman, 16 Ark. App. 188, 699 S.W.2d 401 (1985).

      </h4>
      <p>
       A claim is compensable, without proof of unusual strain or exertion, when the claimant's ordinary work aggravates a preexisting condition and thus contributes to the injury. Black v. Riverside Furn. Co., 6 Ark. App. 370, 642 S.W.2d 338 (1982)Criticized byCox v. Nashville Livestock Com., 28 Ark. App. 138, 771 S.W.2d 786 (1989); Colonial Nursing Home v. Harvey, 9 Ark.

       A preexisting disease or infirmity of an employee does not disqualify a claim under the arising out of employment requirement if the employment aggravated, accelerated, or combined with the disease or infirmity to produce the death or disability for which compensation is sought. Gerber Prods. v. McDonald, 15 Ark. App. 226, 691 S.W.2d 879 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a prior condition need not have been a compensable injury, it must be independently producing some degree of disability before the second injury and continue to operate as a disability after the second injury in order for it to constitute a previous disability or impairment. State Second Injury Fund v. Girtman, 16 Ark. App. 155, 698 S.W.2d 514 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Previous disability of impairment” does not refer to a condition which occurred while in the employment of the second-injury employer; the Second Injury Fund is not liable where all of the claimant's disability or impairment results from injuries occurring while in the employment of the same employer. Second Injury Fund v. Riceland Foods, Inc., 17 Ark. App. 104, 704 S.W.2d 635 (1986), aff'd, 289 Ark. 528, 715 S.W.2d 432 (1986); Second Injury Fund v. McCarver, 17 Ark. App. 101, 704 S.W.2d 639, aff'd, 289 Ark. 509, 715 S.W.2d 429 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the Second Injury Fund is liable, one must have a preexisting condition that is independently causing a loss of earning capacity at the time of the second injury, and which continues to do so. Second Injury Fund v. Yarbrough, 19 Ark. App. 354, 721 S.W.2d 686 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's prior impairment must have been of a physical quality sufficient in and of itself to support an award of compensation had the elements of compensability existed as to the cause for the impairment. It is the substantial nature of the impairment which is emphasized, and the elements of compensability, none of which may have existed as to the particular claimant, merely assist the fact finder in his determination as to whether the former condition was sufficient in degree to constitute an impairment qualifying the claimant as one of the “handicapped” for whose benefit this section was enacted. Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       When it is determined that through the combination of a preexisting condition which is not work-related and a current compensable injury the claimant has sustained a disability greater than would have resulted from either of them alone, this section provides that the claimant shall be fully compensated for his current disability, but does not provide that the Second Injury Fund shall compensate the claimant for his preexisting non-work related condition. Weaver v. Tyson Foods, 31 Ark. App. 147, 790 S.W.2d 442 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's pre-existing impairment did not combine with his work-related injury to produce his current disability status; claimant's current disability status was solely the result of his compensable injury, and the Second Injury Fund had no liability. Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In addressing Second Injury Fund liability, the determination of whether an employee suffered preexisting impairment in addition to any disability which resulted from a work-related injury is a factual one and is to be made by the Commission. Chamberlain Group v. Rios, 45 Ark. App. 144, 871 S.W.2d 595 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employee's preexisting diabetes did not affect his ability to work prior to his admitted compensable injury, the diabetes was not a preexisting impairment sufficient to trigger Second Injury Fund liability. Chamberlain Group v. Rios, 45 Ark. App. 144, 871 S.W.2d 595 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it is well-settled that the aggravation of a pre-existing noncompensable condition by a compensable injury is itself compensable, the commission's decision not to award compensation because there were other possible causes for claimant's condition, was erroneous. Hubley v. Best Western-Governor's Inn, 52 Ark. App. 226, 916 S.W.2d 143 (1996), superseded by statute as stated in, Service Chevrolet v. Atwood, 61 Ark. App. 190, 966 S.W.2d 909 (1998).

       Arkansas Court of Appeals, Division Four, holds that a claimant with a scheduled injury is not entitled to permanent partial disability benefits, and this applies whether the claimant is seeking benefits from an employer, an insurer, or the Arkansas Second Injury Fund. Therefore, a claimant, who lost four fingers in an accident, was unable to obtain wage-loss disability over and above the impairment rating to her hand based on a previous diagnosis of foot ulcers, even if the Fund was liable.

      <p>
       The wage-loss factor rather than the functional or anatomical loss is controlling in disability determinations which are to be made by the commission on the basis of medical evidence, age, education, experience and other matters reasonably expected to affect the claimant's earning power. Rooney v. Charles, 262 Ark. 695, 560 S.W.2d 797 (1978); City of Fayetteville v. Guess, 10 Ark. App. 313, 663 S.W.2d 946 (1984); Perry v. Mar-Bax Shirt Co., 16 Ark. App. 133, 698 S.W.2d 302 (1985).

       A worker may be entitled to additional wage loss disability even though his wages remain the same or increase after the injury. City of Fayetteville v. Guess, 10 Ark. App. 313, 663 S.W.2d 946 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant's nonwork related condition suffered prior to the recent compensable injury need not have involved a loss of earning capacity. Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining what is an “impairment,” loss of earning capacity becomes nothing more than one of the elements of compensability which, though possibly lacking in the particular case, constitutes a point of reference in determining whether the claimant's former nonwork related condition would be capable of supporting an award. Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988).
      </p>

       Prior wage-earning loss is not a prerequisite to finding that an impairment and work-related injury have “combined” to produce one's level of disability. Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. McWilliams, 41 Ark. App. 1, 846 S.W.2d 670 (1993).

       Substantial evidence failed to support the Workers'
   Compensation Commission's finding that a truck driver employee failed to prove entitlement to temporary total disability benefits from December 21, 2017, to a date yet to be determined; although the employee had previously declined light-duty work within the restrictions for the knee strain, his family physician later totally restricted him from working due to the deep-vein-thrombosis injury. This section had no application because the employee was totally restricted from working and thus there was no work the employer could have offered that would have accommodated the employee's off-work status.

       Substantial evidence supported the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission's finding that a claimant was terminated for his inability to perform his job as a result of his injury and not for misconduct. Accepting light duty work and returning to work for one full day before returning to light duty work did not bar his claim for TTD benefits, especially since, if he had refused, his claim would have been barred under this section.

      <p>
       Pursuant to this section, an employee with a knee injury who refused light duty work offered to him by his employer following surgery on the knee was not entitled to temporary total disability (TTD) benefits because, under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-521ol1a" target="_self">11-9-521(a)</a></cite>, the failure to return to work must have been causally related to the injury.

      <p>
       In a workers'
   compensation case, a claimant's refusal to work at the light-duty jobs offered to her barred her from receiving temporary-total disability benefits that she sought, pursuant to this section. It was shown that the claimant refused to take jobs in a medical clinic, refused to work in a laundry room, and she failed to show that her prescribed medications posed a danger to the patients at the medical clinic.
   Neal v. Sparks Reg'l Med. Ctr., 104 Ark. App. 97, 289 S.W.3d 163 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 11-9-520 contemplates a situation in which an employee returns to work but, because of a temporary-partial disability, is not earning the same wages as before the injury; where this section bars a claimant from receiving temporary-total-disability benefits for a designated period of time because of a refusal to accept suitable employment that is within the claimant's capacity to perform, the same rationale applies to bar the claimant from receiving temporary-partial disability. Therefore, in a case where a claimant refused to accept work within her capability at a medical clinic or in a laundry room after she suffered a compensable shoulder and neck injury, she was unable to receive temporary-partial disability.
   Neal v. Sparks Reg'l Med. Ctr., 104 Ark. App. 97, 289 S.W.3d 163 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was substantial evidence to deny an employee's claim for temporary-total disability benefits on the basis that he refused suitable employment because an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that the testimony of the employer's executive director that she offered the employee a job within his restrictions, and he refused the job, that such refusal was unjustified, and that such refusal barred his claim for temporary-total disability benefits; the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission affirmed and adopted the ALJ's findings, and the court of appeals was bound by the Commission's credibility decisions.
   Johnson v. Abilities Unlimited, Inc., 2009 Ark. App. 866, 372 S.W.3d 838 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission to award an employee benefits for medical treatment and temporary total disability was supported by substantial evidence because the Commission found that the job of soil-coding, which was light duty work at the employee's same wages, was not actually available since there was not enough soil-coding work to be done; the Commission based its finding on the testimony of the employee's supervisor.

       Finding against the employee in his workers'
   compensation action was appropriate under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol112" target="_self">11-9-102(12)</a></cite> and this section because there was substantial evidence to support the finding that the employee failed to avail himself of the opportunity to work and that he was not entitled to temporary disability after May 8, 2008. A release to work stated that the employee be provided jobs within his sedentary restrictions and both the employee and his manager testified that he left that work with various complaints of inability to perform.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission demonstrated a substantial basis for denying an employee’s claim for wage-loss disability because reasonable minds could conclude the employee failed to prove she was entitled to any wage loss disability in excess of the fifteen-percent whole body impairment awarded; the employee’s work experience was rather sedentary, and the functional-capacity evaluation concluded that despite her significant limitations, she was capable of performing sedentary tasks.
   Templeton v. Dollar General Store, 2014 Ark. App. 248, 434 S.W.3d 417 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, former employee was not entitled to temporary total disability benefits for a period of time because the evidence showed that she refused suitable employment that the employer made available within her physical restrictions; although the employee claimed the work offered was not within the doctor's restrictions, the work was not repetitive for the body part that was injured and for which the restrictions were designed — the employee's right shoulder.

       Workers'

       Although former employer suggested that employee might be rehired if she reapplied for a light-duty job, this does not constitute an offer of employment as contemplated by this section; because the employee was never offered a job, there was no substantial evidence to support the commission's findings that the employee unjustifiably refused employment suitable to her capacity.

   Walker v. Cooper Auto., 289 S.W.3d 184 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee stated that he attempted to do the work, but was sent home, and if the employee's testimony was accepted, he never refused suitable work, and if a coworker's testimony was accepted, then at best any refusal to do the work was justifiable given the employee's inability to do the work.

      </p>
      <p>
       In holding that an employee was entitled to additional TTD benefits, wage loss benefits, and attorney fees, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission correctly interpreted the statute; the employee's misconduct, which resulted in termination, did not amount to a refusal of suitable employment.

       Failure to grant retroactive application of the 1976 amendment to subsection (d) to child who had received compensation did not deny his right to equal protection. Park v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 262 Ark. 668, 560 S.W.2d 226 (1978) (decision prior to 1976 amendment).
      </p>

       The section was severable and the offending words “during the continuance of his incapacity or” were excised from it. Swafford v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 2 Ark. App. 343, 621 S.W.2d 862 (1981) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).

      </p>
      <p>
       Because of countless possibilities that may occur in the future with regard to parents and their children, the Legislature provided courts with a clear directive in subsection (h) of this section, stating all questions of dependency shall be determined at the time of the injury. This directive is simple and unambiguous. Dependency is determined at the time of injury.

       With respect to § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102" target="_self">11-9-102</a></cite> and this section, it was the legislature's intent that to provide compensation for the death of an employee and to make compensation available equally for a widow and widower would be more consistent with the legislative purpose than to exclude widows; thus, the employer could not successfully argue that deletion of the unconstitutional portions of these sections was not the proper way to equalize treatment for widows and widowers. Russell v. International Paper Co., 2 Ark. App. 355, 621 S.W.2d 867 (1981) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).

       The minimum amount set forth in the section was not intended to apply to a case in which the calculation of compensation for partial dependency produces an award of less than the minimum. Vines v. Arkansas Kraft Corp., 247 Ark. 573, 446 S.W.2d 669 (1969).

       The 1976 amendment to subsection (d) would not be applied retroactively to a child who received compensation, under the preexisting subsection, only until his eighteenth birthday. Park v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 262 Ark. 668, 560 S.W.2d 226 (1978).

       The right of a widow to receive 35 percent of the average weekly wages of her deceased husband was prior to all claims; in addition thereto, where she qualified under former law she was entitled to an additional compensation for each minor child. Gunnells v. Gunnells, 203 Ark. 632, 158 S.W.2d 54 (1942) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of dependency benefits to the deceased husband's son was appropriate pursuant to subsection (c) of these section, because there was no evidence that at the time of his father's death, the son had a reasonable expectation of support from him. The son was a frozen embryo at that time and was not born until approximately two years after his father's death.
   Finley v. Farm Cat, Inc., 103 Ark. App. 292, 288 S.W.3d 685 (2008), review denied, — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Ark. LEXIS 464 (Apr. 9, 2009).

      <p>
       Survivor benefits were properly awarded to a deceased employee's minor children in Mexico under subsection (c) of this section after the employee was involved in a fatal workplace accident in the U.S. because the employee's children were wholly and actually dependent upon him, even though his wife testified that she never expected to see him again.
   Death & Permanent Total Disability Trust Fund v. Rodriguez, 104 Ark. App. 375, 292 S.W.3d 827 (2009), review denied, — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Ark. LEXIS 445 (May 7, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dependent benefits were properly awarded to a deceased employee's parents under this section as: (1) the decedent sent the parents money regularly from the United States while he was working here, and had supported them since 1990 when he worked in Mexico; (2) the parents testified that the money was critical to them, and that they received no other money from family members; and (3) the money-transfer records were made out to the mother, but she took care of household bills in cash and gave the father money as needed.

      </p>
      <p>
       Both of a deceased employee's parents were properly awarded dependent benefits under this section as this section and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-111" target="_self">11-9-111</a></cite> had to be read together to understand the Arkansas legislature's intent, and the appellate court was not convinced that by the use of the word “or” to separate the words father and mother in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-111" target="_self">11-9-111</a></cite>, the legislature intended to render the award of benefits to each parent provided by this section void.

      </p>
      <p>
       Deceased employee's parents were properly awarded dependent benefits under this section as the one-year period in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-111" target="_self">11-9-111</a></cite> would have been July 2006 through July 2007, and the testimony presented by his parents, coupled with a portion of the records of money transfers (July 3, 2006 through July 25, 2007), supported the determination that the decedent provided support for one year prior to the date of his death.
   White Oak Constr. Co. v. Olvera, 2011 Ark. App. 682, 386 S.W.3d 616 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       One statute only provides the maximum amount of money an employer must pay as compensation for an employee's work-related death, but the statute is silent on whether a credit for good-faith, but ultimately mistaken, payments may be given; because the widow was not her husband's dependent, the money the employer paid her could not be counted as weekly benefits or compensation, and the payments did not accrue as a credit against the employer's responsibility to the Fund.
   Royal v. Bypass Diesel & Wrecker, Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 90, 432 S.W.3d 139 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Widow had the burden to establish facts showing dependency on her husband before being entitled to benefits.
   Royal v. Bypass Diesel & Wrecker, Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 90, 432 S.W.3d 139 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Widow did not have a statutorily required expectation of support from her husband when he died, as she could not say with certainty that they would have reconciled had he not died, and she had not withdrawn the divorce papers and she had removed him from her phone plan and dropped his life and health insurance; the court affirmed the denial of benefits.
   Royal v. Bypass Diesel & Wrecker, Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 90, 432 S.W.3d 139 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the widow was actually dependent on her husband when he died was a fact question.
   Royal v. Bypass Diesel & Wrecker, Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 90, 432 S.W.3d 139 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the decision that the widow was not actually dependent on her husband when he died, as she was working full time to support herself, she lived apart from her husband and had filed for divorce without asking for support, and his monthly contributions were between $200 and $300, which were insufficient.
   Royal v. Bypass Diesel & Wrecker, Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 90, 432 S.W.3d 139 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a workers'
   compensation case, there was an error in giving preference to a deceased employee's wife as the widow, rather than apportioning the benefits to her and the children as a class where the number of dependent children exceeded the amount payable. Because there was not enough money to pay a widow a 35 percent share and each dependent child a 15 percent share, each member of the class could have been paid an equal share, or a determination of beneficiaries could have been made.

      </p>
      <p>
       In case of a deceased workman who left surviving him a widow and two minor children by a prior marriage, the widow did not have priority, but shared priority with the children, and should receive a proportionate amount of the maximum weekly benefit. Gary McJunkin Trucking Co. v. Byars, 258 Ark. 387, 525 S.W.2d 662 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission erred in holding that a dependent widow and three children can recover 80% of the deceased employee's average weekly wage since this exceeds 662/3% of the deceased's average weekly wage; the amounts set out in this section are subject to the maximum limitations as set forth in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-501ol1b" target="_self">11-9-501(b)</a></cite>.

       Although children of decedent lived with their mother, who did not receive formal child support, children were found to be entitled to benefits under this section. Lawhon Farm Servs. v. Brown, 60 Ark. App. 64, 958 S.W.2d 538 (1997), aff'd, 335 Ark. 272, 984 S.W.2d 1 (1998).

       Prior events and all circumstances are to be considered in determination of the relation of dependency, since a temporary situation is not controlling. Nolen v. Wortz Biscuit Co., 210 Ark. 446, 196 S.W.2d 899 (1946) (decision under prior law).
      </p>

       One is a dependent under the act if he relies for support on employee in whole or in part. E.H. Noel Coal Co. v. Grilc, 215 Ark. 430, 221 S.W.2d 49 (1949) (decision under prior law).

       Dependency is determined as of the time of the injury. Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Yeager, 219 Ark. 20, 239 S.W.2d 1019 (1951) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The addition of the word “actually” in subsection (c) was intended to change what amounted to a conclusive presumption of dependency under prior cases; it follows that when the widow and child were not living with the employee at the time of his death, there must be some showing of actual dependency.

       For the purposes of determining eligibility for benefits under this section, dependency is a question of fact as opposed to a question of law. Doyle's Concrete Finishers v. Moppin, 267 Ark. 874, 596 S.W.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1979); Hunter Mem. United Methodist Church v. Millirons, 268 Ark. 975, 597 S.W.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1980); Pinecrest Mem. Park v. Miller, 7 Ark. App. 185, 646 S.W.2d 33 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons who are ordinarily recognized in law as dependents, including a wife and child, and to whom the employee owes a duty of support are “wholly dependent” and establishing whether they are “actually dependent” under subsection (c) does not require total dependency, but rather a showing of actual support or a reasonable expectation of support. Porter Seed Cleaning, Inc. v. Skinner, 1 Ark. App. 230, 615 S.W.2d 380 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       A factor to be considered in determining dependency is the claimant's reasonable expectation of future support. Williams v. Cypress Creek Drainage, 5 Ark. App. 256, 635 S.W.2d 282 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an administrative law judge, in denying dependency benefits to the decedent's mother, took his definition of the word “dependent” from a popular dictionary instead of this chapter and the appellate cases which have construed and interpreted this chapter, and where the commission specifically stated that it adopted the law judge's opinion as its own, the decision appealed from was not based upon the law and had to be remanded. Williams v. Cypress Creek Drainage, 5 Ark. App. 256, 635 S.W.2d 282 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the support being furnished at the time of the worker's injury is obviously important in determining dependency benefits, conditions prior to the injury should also be considered; a reasonable period of time should be used, as dependency is not to be controlled by an unusual temporary situation. Williams v. Cypress Creek Drainage, 5 Ark. App. 256, 635 S.W.2d 282 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       In situations where the surviving spouse or child is living apart from the deceased at the time of his death, the test of wholly dependent is met by proof of that legal status and actually dependent does not require a showing of total dependence, rather a finding of some measure of actual support or a reasonable expectation of it will suffice. Pinecrest Mem. Park v. Miller, 7 Ark. App. 185, 646 S.W.2d 33 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dependency of a stepchild is not a question of law, but a fact issue to be determined by the circumstances existing when the compensable injury occurs; it is based on proof of either actual support from the deceased employee, or a showing of a reasonable expectation of support where there is evidence that the stepchild is being actually supported by her natural parent, or where she has a right to expect support from the natural parent even if it is not actually provided. Hoskins v. Rogers Cold Storage, 52 Ark. App. 219, 916 S.W.2d 136 (1996).
      </p>

       This section cannot be interpreted to mean that a minor child would never be entitled to the death benefits specified in subsection (c)(3) if the parents were divorced and the child received any support whatever from the surviving parent.

       Where decedent-claimant acknowledged both his sons, visited with or maintained telephone contact with them, and contributed, albeit sporadically, to their welfare and support, they were dependents entitled to workers' compensation death benefits; the fact that the boys' mothers did not secure child-support payments from the decedent-claimant did not mean that the boys no longer had any reasonable expectation of support.

       Whether or not a minor child, not living with one of his parents and receiving only a part of his support therefrom, is subject to the partial dependency benefits of this section is a fact question to be determined in light of surrounding circumstances, since the addition of the word “actually” in subsection (c) means that there is no longer a conclusive presumption of the dependency of a child.

       In determining whether actual dependency exists, the commission need only find some dependency upon the deceased employee to entitle widow to the maximum benefits provided for in the compensation law; the fact that the husband was not the sole support of his wife does not subject her to the section of the compensation law providing benefits for partial dependency.

       Provision that a widow is to receive a sum “equal to” 104 times the weekly benefits she had been receiving upon her remarriage is an additional benefit to compensate the widow for the loss of future weekly benefits occasioned by her remarriage. Ashby v. Arkansas Vinegar Co., 22 Ark. App. 167, 737 S.W.2d 177 (1987), aff'd, 294 Ark. 412, 743 S.W.2d 798 (1988).

       Lump-sum payment upon widow's remarriage is not to be treated as an advance of weekly benefits. Ashby v. Arkansas Vinegar Co., 22 Ark. App. 167, 737 S.W.2d 177 (1987), aff'd, 294 Ark. 412, 743 S.W.2d 798 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a worker's death arises out of his employment and his widow subsequently remarries and receives in one lump sum payment equal to 104 weeks compensation, the increase in benefits payable to her children on her remarriage becomes due immediately and is not postponed until the end of the 104 weeks following the remarriage. Reference to 104 weeks contained in subsection (d) was merely intended to serve as a basis by which to determine the amount of the sum to be paid to a widow upon her remarriage. Ashby v. Arkansas Vinegar Co., 22 Ark. App. 167, 737 S.W.2d 177 (1987), aff'd, 294 Ark. 412, 743 S.W.2d 798 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Worker's compensation carrier was not entitled to “credit” the lump sum payment to the widow against periodic payments due the remaining dependents. Workers' Compensation Commission improperly denied the decedent's dependent children an increase in benefits upon the remarriage of their mother; upon remarriage of widow, remaining dependents are entitled to compensation in the amount they would have received had they been only persons entitled to benefits upon death of their father. Arkansas Vinegar Co. v. Ashby, 294 Ark. 412, 743 S.W.2d 798 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious purpose of the lump sum benefit provision upon remarriage is to lessen the disincentive to remarry that would be inherent in a flat cutoff of dependency benefits. This disincentive for marriage does not cease to exist when the employer reaches his maximum liability in weekly benefits; it continues indefinitely because the widow continues to receive benefits from the fund. Therefore, the need for the reduction of the disincentive, in the form of a lump sum payment, is still needed even after the employer reaches his maximum liability. City of Fort Smith v. Tate, 38 Ark. App. 172, 832 S.W.2d 262 (1992), aff'd, 311 Ark. 405, 844 S.W.2d 356 (Ark. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing a widow to receive the lump sum payment at the time she is remarried, regardless of whether the employer or carrier has reached its maximum liability in weekly benefits, is the only interpretation of the statute that is consistent with the plain language of the statute, the history of the provisions in question, and the purposes underlying these provisions. It appears that the “full and complete payment” language, in subdivision (d)(1), was inadvertently left in from a time when it had some relevance and, in light of the delimitation on a widow's weekly benefits, it is now meaningless surplusage. City of Fort Smith v. Tate, 38 Ark. App. 172, 832 S.W.2d 262 (1992), aff'd, 311 Ark. 405, 844 S.W.2d 356 (Ark. 1993).

       This section is facially neutral and in no way violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; there is nothing in the language of this section to indicate that any individual or group of individuals is to be singled out for different treatment under similar circumstances.

      </p>

       Where employer was afforded a hearing before the Workers' Compensation Commission to determine whether a lump-sum attorney's fee would be awarded, that hearing provided the employer due process of law in regard to the award of a lump-sum attorney's fee.

       Where, at the time petition seeking biweekly payments was filed, the claimant had a right to ask that his attorney be paid in one lump-sum, but he did not do so and the administrative law judge entered an award directing that the attorney's fees be paid on a biweekly basis as they accrued, the order of the administrative law judge became final after a period of 30 days not only as to the amount of compensation but also as to the manner in which it was to be paid, and a reopening of the matter was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Gwin v. R.D. Hall Tank Co., 10 Ark. App. 12, 660 S.W.2d 947 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section authorizes the commission to award lump-sum attorney's fees; no limitations are set forth, because none were apparently intended. The legislature must have intended to authorize the commission to award fees in any or all cases. Thus, the statute's guidelines are discernible; lump-sum attorney's fees can be awarded in any or all cases. International Paper Co. v. McBride, 12 Ark. App. 400, 678 S.W.2d 375 (1984).

       The first duty to report an injury to the Workers' Compensation Commission lies with the employer not the employee, and the employer is not entitled to extend its duty to pay compensation within 15 days by withholding the filing of the claim with the commission in the first instance. Hart's Exxon Serv. Station v. Prater, 268 Ark. 961, 597 S.W.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1980).

       Evidence sufficient to support commission's finding that the claim was controverted in its entirety since the employer must bear any loss resulting from its own reporting mistakes and delays. Hart's Exxon Serv. Station v. Prater, 268 Ark. 961, 597 S.W.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1980).

       An employer's failure to file a report to the Workers' Compensation Commission within 10 days of receipt of knowledge of the claimant's injury did not render erroneous as a matter of law the Commission's decision that the plaintiff's claim was time-barred.

       Where an employee suffers from an occupational disease as defined in this subchapter and is disabled or dies as a result of the disease and where the disease was due to the nature of the occupation or process in which he or she was employed within the period previous to his or her disablement as limited in subsection (g) of this section, then the employee, or, in case of death, his or her dependents, shall be entitled to compensation as if the disablement or death were caused by injury, except as otherwise provided in this subchapter.

       Even though the Workers' Compensation Commission may not have authority to declare challenged statutes unconstitutional, such issues should first be raised at the administrative law judge or commission level. Hamilton v. Jeffrey Stone Co., 6 Ark. App. 333, 641 S.W.2d 723 (1982).

       A proper interpretation of subdivision (e)(2) requires that it be read in conjunction with this chapter as a whole, and particularly those sections dealing with the same subject matter. Sanyo Mfg. Corp. v. Leisure, 12 Ark. App. 274, 675 S.W.2d 841 (1984); Hyman v. Farmland Feed Mill, 24 Ark. App. 63, 748 S.W.2d 151 (1988).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Subdivision (c)(1) of this section contemplates two situations wherein apportionment is appropriate; the first situation arises when an occupational disease is aggravated by any other noncompensable disease or infirmity, and the second situation arises when a noncompensable disability or death is aggravated, prolonged, accelerated, or in any way contributed to by an occupational disease. Jenkins v. Halstead Indus., 17 Ark. App. 197, 706 S.W.2d 191 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement in subdivision (c)(1) of this section for the noncompensable disease or infirmity to be independently producing disability before and after the development of the occupational disease in order for it to be apportionable. Jenkins v. Halstead Indus., 17 Ark. App. 197, 706 S.W.2d 191 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Workers' Compensation Commission's finding that the occupational disease was aggravated by another disease or infirmity, not itself compensable, and that apportionment was proper, the commission did not err in finding that 92% of the claimant's disability was attributable to smoking, and 8% of his disability was attributable to his occupation. Jenkins v. Halstead Indus., 17 Ark. App. 197, 706 S.W.2d 191 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' compensation commission erred in holding two healthcare providers equally liable for benefits payable to a nurse who was disabled as a result of sensitivity to latex gloves worn while the nurse was employed by the providers; the appellate court remanded the matter to the commission to assign liability based on when the nurse was last injuriously exposed to latex considering the factor of when her disablement occurred and not merely when the symptoms of the problem manifested themselves.

      <p>
       Fact that breathing of dust, which aggravated disease, continued over a period of years and damage was gradual and it could not be shown at what exact instant disability occurred was not ground for denying compensation. Batesville White Lime Co. v. Bell, 212 Ark. 23, 205 S.W.2d 31 (1947) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission is not required to rely upon inference that there is a causal connection between the injury and the disability where there is positive medical testimony to the contrary. The determination of whether the causal connection of the injury to the disability exists is a question of fact for the commission to determine. Carter v. Flintrol, Inc., 19 Ark. App. 317, 720 S.W.2d 337 (1986), superseded by statute as stated in, Service Chevrolet v. Atwood, 61 Ark. App. 190, 966 S.W.2d 909 (1998).

       Causal connection is generally a matter of inference, and possibilities may play a proper and important role in establishing that relationship. Hope Brick Works v. Welch, 33 Ark. App. 103, 802 S.W.2d 476 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In workers' compensation cases, medical opinions need not be expressed in terms of reasonable medical certainty in speaking of a causal connection when there is supplemental evidence supporting the causal connection. Hope Brick Works v. Welch, 33 Ark. App. 103, 802 S.W.2d 476 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission's finding of a causal connection between the claimant's silicosis and his employment was supported by substantial evidence. Hope Brick Works v. Welch, 33 Ark. App. 103, 802 S.W.2d 476 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no basis in the record for the Workers' Compensation Commission to find that the claimant failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that her occupational disease was caused by her employment where her physician testified that the claimant was exposed to substances that were on a warning label and that it “was very likely that these substances caused the trouble,” and he also responded affirmatively when asked whether he believed within a reasonable medical certainty that the claimant's exposure at work was at least 51 percent of the cause of her condition.

       Where claimant applied for workers' compensation claiming permanent partial disability caused by an occupational disease, and the employer changed insurance carriers during the period in which he worked, full liability fastened upon the insurer which was on a risk at the time the employee ceased work, absolving any prior insurers regardless of the extremity of progression of the disease, short of cessation of work. Employers Liab. Assurance Corp. v. Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., 232 Ark. 113, 334 S.W.2d 701 (1960).

        Classification of Condition.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The commission's efforts to categorize a condition as an injury or occupational disease should be based not simply on how the medical profession may characterize a given condition, but rather primarily on factors germane to the purposes of workers' compensation law, which include the general remedial goals of the act, efficiency of future claim handling, the extent to which the classification being considered would encourage safer employment practices, and avoidance of unacceptably high costs to the system. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Watkins, 31 Ark. App. 230, 792 S.W.2d 348 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a condition is an injury or occupational disease, where the ambiguity of the statutory language permits alternative interpretations, the workers' compensation commission and courts should generally resolve the ambiguity in favor of claimants. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Watkins, 31 Ark. App. 230, 792 S.W.2d 348 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a condition is an injury or an occupational disease, the initial presumption should be that conditions on the pre-1976 schedule of compensable occupational diseases were still to be handled under former A.S.A § 81-1314 (see now §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-601" target="_self">11-9-601</a></cite> — <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-603" target="_self">11-9-603</a></cite>), although the commission is not required to do so since the schedule has been repealed. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Watkins, 31 Ark. App. 230, 792 S.W.2d 348 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the evidence showed that the appellant's traumatic injury resulted from a single injurious exposure and was sudden in its onset, the commission erred in characterizing it as an occupational disease rather than an injury. Hancock v. Modern Indus. Laundry, 46 Ark. App. 186, 878 S.W.2d 416 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee acquired a serious infection through scratches obtained during the course of employment, the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission erred by requiring the employee to prove that the infection was an occupational disease; the employee was only required to establish a causal link between the scratches and the infection in order to show a compensable accident injury under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol14a" target="_self">11-9-102(4)(a)</a></cite>.

       Where only one of four experts testified that the claimant's symptoms were caused by exposure to toxic chemicals, the evidence was sufficient to support the Commission's determination that the claimant was not entitled to benefits for an occupational disease.

       A false representation as to a physical condition in procuring employment will preclude the benefits of this chapter for an otherwise compensable injury if it is shown that the employee knowingly and willfully made a false representation as to his physical condition, the employer relied upon the false representation, which reliance was a substantial factor in the employment, and there was a causal connection between the false representation and the injury.

       In construing subdivision (e)(3), the fact that the general public may contract the disease is not controlling; the test of compensability is whether the nature of employment exposes the worker to a greater risk of that disease than the risk experienced by the general public or workers in other employments.

       In a claim for occupational disease, a claimant cannot prevail on a mere preponderance of the evidence. The causal connection between the occupation or employment and the occupational disease must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Arkansas Dep't of Cor. v.

       The characterization of claimant's injury affects the burden of proof. If claimant's condition is an “injury,” she has the burden of proving that it arose out of and in the course of her employment by a preponderance of the evidence; but if her condition is an “occupational disease,” a causal connection between the employment and the disease must be established by clear and convincing evidence.

       Even though circuit court on appeal from commission in occupational disease case may have authority to review the case on all questions whether of law or fact, there must be substantial evidence to support the finding of the circuit court. Bruner-Ivory Handle Co. v. Yates, 212 Ark. 1010, 208 S.W.2d 997 (1948) (decision under prior law).

       An employee's claim for benefits for illness resulting from exposure to certain chemicals, was for an occupational disease and thus subject to the clear and convincing evidence standard. Johnson v. Democrat Printing & Lithograph, 57 Ark. App. 274, 944 S.W.2d 138 (1997).

       Even though claimant did not give proper notice of claim to employer, the requirement was waived where employer did not raise any objection at or before the first hearing. Peerless Coal Co. v. Gordon, 237 Ark. 152, 372 S.W.2d 240 (1963).
      </p>

       Waiver of notice applicable to occupational diseases is no different from that applicable to accidental injuries; notice can be waived in either case. Peerless Coal Co. v. Gordon, 237 Ark. 152, 372 S.W.2d 240 (1963).

       The authority of the Workers' Compensation Commission to excuse the failure to give notice under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-701" target="_self">11-9-701</a></cite> would also apply to the failure to give notice of occupational disease as required under this section. Quality Serv. Railcar v. Williams, 36 Ark. App. 29, 820 S.W.2d 278 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The time period for notice to the employer begins to run from the first distinct manifestation of a disease cognizable under workers' compensation, not the first distinct manifestation of the disease. Quality Serv. Railcar v. Williams, 36 Ark. App. 29, 820 S.W.2d 278 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court was unable to make a determination with regard to an employer's claims of improper notice of an occupational disease because the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission made no findings with regard to whether or not an employee complied with the notice requirements of subdivision (a)(2)(A) of this section.
   Pharmerica v. Seratt, 103 Ark. App. 9, 285 S.W.3d 699 (2008).

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the welfare of both employer and employee is of primary interest and concern to the State of Arkansas; that the maximum benefits presently payable under the Workmen's Compensation law are inadequate due to the steadily increasing cost of living and should be increased immediately to meet said increase in the cost of living; that certain other provisions should be clarified or modified, and that it is in the best interest of both employers and employees that this be accomplished as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act, being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

      Acts 1979, No. 215, § 3: Mar. 1, 1979. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the Arkansas Supreme Court has invalidated the award of lump sum attorneys fees by the Workers Compensation Commission in instances where the claimant was awarded compensation payable in installments. This has resulted in attorneys fees being paid in minute amounts over a long period of time, and if the claimant dies prior to the attorneys fees being fully recovered from the installment payments, the attorney does not receive full compensation for his efforts. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect from the date of its passage and approval.”

      Acts 1979, No. 252, § 5: July 1, 1979.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act, being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1979.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1979, No. 253, § 12: Mar. 2, 1977. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that certain provisions of the Worker's Compensation law are in urgent need of revision to more clearly define the benefits to be provided by Worker's Compensation coverage; that this Act is designed to provide such clarification and should be given effect immediately. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

      Acts 1979, No. 822, § 3: Apr. 10, 1979.

Therefore an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1981, No. 631, § 5: Mar. 23, 1981. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Third General Assembly that the law as to permissible cross appeals to the Workers' Compensation Commission and the Arkansas Court of Appeals is ambiguous and must be clarified immediately to eliminate the possibility of inequitable treatment of parties before these tribunals; that Section 20 of the Workers' Compensation Act should be immediately amended to eliminate internal inconsistency in the Act; and that the scope of the Commission's authority to award attorneys fees on a lump sum basis is unclear and must be immediately clarified. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act, being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

State, CR 86-31, a question has arisen over the validity of Act 1227 of the Extended Session of 1976; that this Act is a reenactment of the former law; and that the immediate passage of this Act is necessary to clarify the state of the law on this issue. Therefore, an emergency is hereby delared to exist, and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1993.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2003.”
     </p>

       Even though the Workers' Compensation Commission may not have authority to declare challenged statutes unconstitutional, such issues should first be raised at the administrative law judge or commission level. Hamilton v. Jeffrey Stone Co., 6 Ark. App. 333, 641 S.W.2d 723 (1982).
      </p>

       Appellant's constitutional challenge to the silicosis limitations statute failed for lack of proof that an arbitrary classification was involved or the statute was unsupported by a legitimate governmental interest.

      <p>
       The primary purpose of the one-year statute of limitations in subsection (b) of this section is to give the claimant that much extra time to decide whether he has been fully compensated for his injury; consistent with this purpose is the rule that the period is tolled so long as the claimant is being furnished medical services or is being “compensated” — it is the furnishing of the services that tolls the statute, not the payment thereof. Plante v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 319 Ark. 126, 890 S.W.2d 253 (1994).

       The statute of limitations does not apply to scheduled injuries. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. v. Baker, 63 Ark. App. 160, 975 S.W.2d 863 (1998), rev'd, 337 Ark. 94, 989 S.W.2d 151 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a two-year statute of limitations applied to the filing of a claim for workers' compensation benefits pursuant to subsection (a)(1), that limitations period did not apply to bar the employee's claim against the employer where the employee was not filing a claim for workers' compensation benefits, but instead was seeking to enforce an Illinois judgment he had already received based on an injury he sustained in Illnois while working for the employer; in that case, the 10-year limitations period for enforcement of judgments applied, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-114" target="_blank">16-56-114</a></cite>, and the enployee's claim was not barred under it. Dodson v. Taylor, 346 Ark. 443, 57 S.W.3d 710 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's request to obtain a factual determination from the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations in this section as the limitation period did not apply where employee was not making a claim for benefits. Johnson v. Bonds Fertilizer, Inc., 365 Ark. 133, 226 S.W.3d 753 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies solely to claims for additional compensation; thus, it did not apply to a factual determination of whether claimant was a special employee because no claim for compensation had been filed against the company, only a third-party claim filed under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-402" target="_self">11-9-402</a></cite>.

       If in suit for damages it is found that a worker is an employee, not an independent contractor, then, upon further determination by the Workers' Compensation Commission, the employer or insurance carrier is entitled to claim the statutory allowance provided for in subsection (e). Co-Ark. Const. Co. v. Amsler, 234 Ark. 200, 352 S.W.2d 74 (1961).

       The doctrine of election of remedies is not applicable where a workers' compensation claim is made subsequent to the filing of an action at law by an employee against an employer. Owens v. Bill & Tony's Liquor Store, 258 Ark. 887, 529 S.W.2d 354 (1975).

       Filing a claim before the administrative agency of another state charged with the administration of its worker's compensation laws is not an action at law. Haney v. Young Sales Corp., 22 Ark. App. 212, 737 S.W.2d 669 (1987).

       A claimant, on the one hand, should be bound by his acceptance of an official award of compensation in one state if he had actively participated in the procurement of the award and if the employer or insurance carrier had not improperly or in bad faith channeled the claim into that state; if the claimant, on the other hand, did not know that the payments he was receiving were pursuant to the laws of another state, and the payments were not made under an official award, an employer's or carrier's contention that the payment was “under the laws of another state” was a self-serving claim which should not be given effect.

       Employer's failure to receive actual notice of follow-up treatment is not determinative of the limitations on claim for additional compensation where “payment of compensation” was made by employer by virtue of the medical services which were actually furnished within the limitations period and for which employer had reason to know would be furnished. Plante v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 319 Ark. 126, 890 S.W.2d 253 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no better way for petitioner to decide whether he has been fully compensated than to return to his authorized physician or staff for follow-up treatments after surgery; moreover, there is no better illustration of medical services with respect to the provision of which an employer or carrier should have knowledge than follow-up treatment from an authorized surgery. The better practice would be for the employer to be actually notified of these follow-up visits, although the better practice is not what is required by this section. Plante v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 319 Ark. 126, 890 S.W.2d 253 (1994).

       If injury becomes known to claimant his lack of knowledge as to the law on filing of claims is no defense, since one in full possession of his mental faculties should know that he should file a claim if he has an injury. Sanderson & Porter v. Crow, 214 Ark. 416, 216 S.W.2d 796 (1949) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, on appeal to Supreme Court in workers' compensation case, appellant did not make any argument in its brief of the defense of the statute of limitations it had urged below, the point would be treated as abandoned. W. Shanhouse & Sons v. Sims, 224 Ark. 86, 272 S.W.2d 68 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a substantial doubt exists as to the applicable statute of limitations, the longer rather than the shorter limitation is to be preferred and adopted. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Brumley, 226 Ark. 388, 290 S.W.2d 211 (1956); Guthrie v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 20 Ark. App. 69, 724 S.W.2d 187 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employer or his insurance carrier furnishes an injured employee medical and hospital services, this constitutes a payment of compensation or waiver which suspends the running of the time for filing a claim for compensation. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Brumley, 226 Ark. 388, 290 S.W.2d 211 (1956).
      </p>

       The time of disablement is the time when the employee actually became unable to perform his regular work. Quality Excelsior Coal Co. v. Smith, 233 Ark. 67, 342 S.W.2d 480 (1961); Arkansas Coal Co. v. Steele, 237 Ark. 727, 375 S.W.2d 673 (1964).
      </p>

       Where employee voluntarily refunded amounts compensation carrier had tendered as compensation and medical payments, the refunded amounts belonged to the employee and not to the carrier, and employee was entitled to them even though period of limitations for compensation claims had expired. Bryan v. Ford, Bacon & Davis, 246 Ark. 327, 438 S.W.2d 472 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The limitations under this section run in favor of the employer, and a worker's compensation carrier cannot claim the benefit thereof unless the limitation has also run in favor of the employer. Browning's Restaurant v. Kuykendall, 263 Ark. 374, 565 S.W.2d 33 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden is not on the carrier to find out whether medical treatments are continuing; the burden is, rather, on the claimant to act within the time allowed. Superior Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Shelby, 265 Ark. 599, 580 S.W.2d 201 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       While claims for replacement medicine may toll the running of the statute of limitations, such claims cannot revive once the statute has run against other forms of compensation. Terminal Van & Storage v. Hackler, 270 Ark. 113, 603 S.W.2d 893 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of limitations does not run against replacement medicine and claimant could still receive replacement for medicine and drugs if she could establish a connection to the original injury; nevertheless, payment for replacement medicine does not revive a claim for additional benefits once the statute has run against other types of compensation. Terminal Van & Storage v. Hackler, 270 Ark. 113, 603 S.W.2d 893 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the statute of limitations in workers' compensation cases is to permit prompt investigation and treatment of injuries. Woodard v. ITT Higbie Mfg. Co., 271 Ark. 498, 609 S.W.2d 115 (1980); St. John v. Arkansas Lime Co., 8 Ark. App. 278, 651 S.W.2d 104 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of limitations provided in subsection (a) does not begin to run until the true extent of the injury manifests itself and causes an incapacity to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of the accident, which wage loss continues long enough to entitle him to benefits under subchapter 5 of this chapter. Arkansas La. Gas Co. v. Grooms, 10 Ark. App. 92, 661 S.W.2d 433 (1983); Hall's Cleaners v. Wortham, 38 Ark. App. 86, 829 S.W.2d 424, aff'd, 311 Ark. 103, 842 S.W.2d 7 (1992).
      </p>

       Where claimant was incapacitated to earn the wages he was receiving at the time of his accident and the incapacitation continued for a long enough period to entitle him to benefits under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-501" target="_self">11-9-501</a></cite>, he sustained a compensable injury within the meaning of this section and the statute of limitations began running at that time, notwithstanding that the claimant was paid full wages during period of incapacitation. Arkansas La. Gas Co. v. Grooms, 10 Ark. App. 92, 661 S.W.2d 433 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of limitations does not begin to run until the employee knows or should reasonably be expected to be aware of the extent or nature of the injury. Freeman v. Tiffany Stand & Furn., 20 Ark. App. 183, 726 S.W.2d 294 (1987), appeal dismissed, American Mut. Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., 801 S.W.2d 55 (1991).

       The burden of filing a claim within the statute of limitations is on the claimant. Plunkett v. St. Francis Valley Lumber Co., 25 Ark. App. 195, 755 S.W.2d 240 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court cannot extend the period of the statute of limitations on appeal, despite the fact that the claim may be meritorious. Plunkett v. St. Francis Valley Lumber Co., 25 Ark. App. 195, 755 S.W.2d 240 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the substantial character of the injury becomes known, then the claimant must file his claim within a specified period of time, or be barred thereafter by the statute of limitations. McDonald Equip. Co. v. Turner, 26 Ark. App. 264, 766 S.W.2d 936 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of commencing the statute of limitations under subdivision (a)(1), the word “injury” is to be construed as “compensable injury,” and an injury does not become “compensable” until (1) the injury develops or becomes apparent and (2) claimant suffers a loss in earnings on account of the injury; thus, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until both elements of the rule are met. Hall's Cleaners v. Wortham, 311 Ark. 103, 842 S.W.2d 7 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       This state is technically a “compensable injury” state. Hall's Cleaners v. Wortham, 311 Ark. 103, 842 S.W.2d 7 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although claimant's injury to her thumb had been apparent for some three years, it was not until she underwent surgery that the limitations period under subdivision (a)(1) commenced to run. Hall's Cleaners v. Wortham, 311 Ark. 103, 842 S.W.2d 7 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it was clear that the employer's reduction in workers' compensation payments to the employee was without benefit of an order to do so, and the employee was simply attempting to enforce the prior order in the employee's favor and not set forth a claim for additional benefits, this section did not bar the claim. Carroll Elec. Coop. v. Pack, 85 Ark. App. 293, 151 S.W.3d 324 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because claimant's employer had previously paid claimant's medical expenses, his claim should have been one for “additional” benefits, however, regardless of whether the request was classified as an “initial” claim or an “additional” claim, claimant was entitled to benefits; if the claim was classified as a claim for “additional” benefits, then the claim, timely filed, tolled the statute of limitations, and if the claim was classified as a claim for “initial” benefits, it could not be dismissed without a hearing. Dillard v. Benton County Sheriff's Office, 87 Ark. App. 379, 192 S.W.3d 287 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   compensation commission erred in finding that a claim was not barred by subsection (b) of this section and awarding benefits because it found that the claimant had obtained treatment for his shoulder on March 13, 2002 which was within one year of the December 2001 order of dismissal. Instead, the commission should have made a finding as to the last date of payment of compensation because the claim had to have been filed within one year of that date.
   Single Source Transp. v. Kent, 99 Ark. App. 153, 258 S.W.3d 416 (2007).

      <p>
       Where an employee sustained a compensable heart injury by inhaling toxic smoke and subsequently alleged that the inhalation of chemicals also caused permanent damage to the employee's lungs, the claim for a separate lung injury was barred by the statute of limitations because the employee did not effectively file a claim for a lung injury at the same time the employee filed the initial timely claim for a heart injury, and the “latent injury” rule did not save the claim.
   Martin Charcoal, Inc. v. Britt, 102 Ark. App. 252, 284 S.W.3d 91 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant was entitled to receive additional workers'
   compensation benefits because he filed a claim for additional benefits within one year of his last date of compensation, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and because reasonable persons could find that the claimant's continued treatment was necessitated by his work-related injuries.
   Kent v. Single Source Transp., Inc., 103 Ark. App. 151, 287 S.W.3d 619 (2008), review denied, — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Ark. LEXIS 460 (Apr. 16, 2009).

      <p>
       Under subdivision (f)(2) of this section, the legislature intended to protect minors, residing with a natural parent who failed to pursue a claim on their behalf, by permitting them to file a claim after age eighteen; under subdivision (f)(2) and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-801" target="_self">11-9-801</a></cite>, the legislature contemplated court action for the appointment of a guardian and the Arkansas Workers'

      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission properly held that an employee's 2005 claim for medical benefits for a 2000 injury was not time-barred by subsection (b) of this section because the claim was not for additional benefits, but was for the enforcement of a prior order; the employer had stopped paying for medical treatment, without an order to do so, that the employee received after May 2002.
   Care Manor v. Wheeler, 2009 Ark. App. 132, 307 S.W.3d 32 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in finding that the claim for additional benefits was barred by the statute of limitations, because the conclusion that the entry of the agreed order resolved the request for additional benefits and effectively adjudicated the claim for additional benefits ignored the statutory language allowing for an injured employee to pursue additional benefits when the need indisputably arose within the statutory framework; the case was never dismissed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and the agreed order granted a continuing award of benefits which included the physician referral.
   Curtis v. Big Lots, 2009 Ark. App. 292, 307 S.W.3d 37 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission erroneously concluded that the claim for additional benefits was time barred, because the claimant's timely request for additional medical benefits tolled the statute of limitations until the claim was finally and completely litigated, not only on the general medical-benefit claim but on all benefits that might flow from that specific request.
   Stewart v. Ark. Glass Container, 2009 Ark. App. 300, 307 S.W.3d 614 (2009), rehearing denied, — Ark. App. —, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Ark. App. LEXIS 680 (May 27, 2009), rev'd, Stewart v. Ark. Glass Container & Risk Mgmt. Res., 2010 Ark. 198, 366 S.W.3d 358 (2010).

       When appellant developed problems with her fingers in 1993 and 1994 while working on the assembly of motors, she received medical treatment during those years. Although she complained about her thumb in 2005, this was not a new injury; her claim for additional benefits filed in 2007 was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in subdivision (a)(1) and subsection (b) of this section.
   DeSpain v. Franklin Elec. Co., 2009 Ark. App. 770 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to this section, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that the employee's claim was time barred as his present claim was characterized as one for additional benefits; the services were not considered at the time of the previous opinion.
   Gardner v. Beverly Enters., 2009 Ark. App. 787 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's request for additional medical benefits was time-barred under this section because it was not filed one year from when the claimant last received medical benefits or two years from date of the claimant's injury; the claimant's request for change of physician and an administrative law judge's order on a prior claim that was dismissed in its entirety did not toll the statute.
   Stewart v. Ark. Glass Container & Risk Mgmt. Res., 2010 Ark. 198, 366 S.W.3d 358 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Permanent disability claims were barred by the statute of limitations in subdivision (b)(1) of this section because, although a claimant filed a timely request for additional medical treatment, she failed to request permanent-disability benefits until more than one year after the last payment of compensation by an employer.
   Flores v. Walmart Distrubution, 2012 Ark. App. 201 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the last payment for an employee's 2001 back injury was in 2001, any additional compensation for that injury was clearly barred by 2010 pursuant to subdivision (b)(1) of this section.
   Raulston v. Waste Mgmt., 2012 Ark. App. 272, 411 S.W.3d 711 (2012).

      <p>
       Company was entitled to a writ of prohibition, because the lung disease and silicosis claim was covered by the Workers'
   Compensation Law, and the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the claimant's alleged disease from his exposure at home was covered under the Law; the time of disablement was within three years of his last injurious exposure, and the claimant failed to file his claim within the one-year limitation period.
   Porocel Corp. v. Circuit Court of Saline County, 2013 Ark. 172 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute of repose creates a substantive right to be free from liability after a legislatively determined period of time, and subdivision (a)(2)(B) of this section represents a policy-driven, legislative judgment to shield an employer from claims that arise three years after the last injurious exposure; coupled with the exclusive-remedy provision, it was not the intent to absolve an employer of liability after a period of time only to subject the employer to liability in tort after that period.
   Hendrix v. Alcoa, Inc., 2016 Ark. 453, 506 S.W.3d 230 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly dismissed an estate's wrongful-death and survival action against a decedent's employer on the ground that the claims fell within the exclusive-remedy provision of the Workers' Compensation Law because the claims were within the coverage formula of the law, even though the decedent was ultimately denied recovery due to his asbestos claim being time-barred under the law.
   Hendrix v. Alcoa, Inc., 2016 Ark. 453, 506 S.W.3d 230 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the deceased employee had retired from his employment in 1995 but was not diagnosed with mesothelioma until 2012 and thus his workers'
   compensation claim was barred by subdivision (a)(2)(B) of this section, his estate's civil action against the employer for wrongful death also failed; because the Workers' Compensation Law covered occupational diseases and asbestos-related claims, the exclusive-remedy provision applied to bar the civil action.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section barred a claim for additional medical benefits where the claimant never formally filed a Form AR-C claim for compensation for additional benefits after his injury, and the ALJ's prehearing order did not contain the specific language required by subsection (c) of this section.

       The cost of medicine and medical, surgical, or hospital services provided under this chapter is compensation within the meaning of subsection (b), allowing additional claim to be filed for injuries within one year from the last payment of compensation. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Brumley, 226 Ark. 388, 290 S.W.2d 211 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provision of subsection (b) makes no distinction between voluntary payment of compensation and payments made as the result of an award or order of the commission after a hearing and applies to both cases. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Brumley, 226 Ark. 388, 290 S.W.2d 211 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was doubt as to whether employee's claim for additional compensation after receipt of compensation was governed by the six-month period provided by § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-713" target="_self">11-9-713</a></cite> for modification of an award or by subsection (b) of this section, the longer period provided by this section was favored. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Brumley, 226 Ark. 388, 290 S.W.2d 211 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Primary purpose of the one-year statute is to give the claimant that much extra time to decide whether he has been fully compensated for his injury, not for the purpose of paying belated medical bills. Phillips v. Bray, 234 Ark. 190, 351 S.W.2d 147 (1961); Perkins v. Arkansas State Hwy. Dep't, 5 Ark. App. 203, 634 S.W.2d 399 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) is applicable only when a claimant had received compensation and then sought additional compensation. Miller v. Southern Mach. & Iron Works, 239 Ark. 218, 388 S.W.2d 391 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) cannot be used to extend the period within which death benefit can be claimed beyond one year from date of death. Miller v. Southern Mach. & Iron Works, 239 Ark. 218, 388 S.W.2d 391 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the furnishing of additional medical services is compensation and constitutes payment so as to suspend the running of the statutory limitation, the limitation runs from the date of the furnishing of the medical services and not the date of payment therefor by the employer or insurance carrier. Heflin v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co., 244 Ark. 195, 424 S.W.2d 365 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Medical treatment furnished the employee constitutes the payment of compensation, and the statutory period of limitation for filing a claim with the commission for additional compensation starts running from the date of last treatment. McFall v. United States Tobacco Co., 246 Ark. 43, 436 S.W.2d 838 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a claim for additional compensation the statute of limitations only commences at the date the last payment would have been due if the compensation had been paid in installments instead of a lump-sum settlement. Southern Cotton Oil Co. v. Friar, 247 Ark. 98, 444 S.W.2d 556 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claim for additional compensation is to be treated as a continuation of the original demand for compensation, and in fixing the attorney's fee thereon the action of the commission in the parent case is to be considered, while the maximum fee shall be within the fixed limitations of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-715" target="_self">11-9-715</a></cite> and shall not exceed certain percentages of compensation awarded. Norsworthy v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 249 Ark. 159, 458 S.W.2d 401 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employer's offer to provide medical services from one source or another for an employee who has returned to work following a period of temporary disability did not amount to the payment of compensation within the meaning of subsection (b). Industrial, Inc. v. Pierce, 263 Ark. 11, 563 S.W.2d 1 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The manifest purpose of the 1968 amendment to subsection (b) of this section was to extend the statute with respect to an employee's right to obtain the replacement of medicine, crutches, artificial limbs, and other apparatus that would be permanently or indefinitely required as a result of the original compensable injury. Mohawk Rubber Co. v. Thompson, 265 Ark. 16, 576 S.W.2d 216 (1979).
      </p>

       The one-year statute governing claims for additional compensation runs from the last payment of compensation, which means the furnishing of medical services. Superior Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Shelby, 265 Ark. 599, 580 S.W.2d 201 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence sufficient to support the commission's finding that the medical treatment afforded claimant effectively tolled the running of the statute of limitation, and therefore the employer was liable for the additional medical expenses incurred by the claimant. Salant & Salant, Inc. v. Williams, 267 Ark. 987, 593 S.W.2d 63 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>

       There is only one consistent, harmonious construction to be placed on the relationship between subsection (b) of this section and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-713" target="_self">11-9-713</a></cite> in an effort to make them both effective: Where a claimant seeks additional benefits after a final award, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-713" target="_self">11-9-713</a></cite> governs as to the grounds required, and subsection (b) of this section governs the period of limitation for all claims for additional benefits whether or not there has been a final award. Southern Wooden Box Co. v. Smith, 5 Ark. App. 14, 631 S.W.2d 620 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant is not entitled under Arkansas law to obtain additional benefits after a final award without a showing that he has experienced a change in physical condition; a change in economic conditions is not a sufficient ground for reopening an award. Southern Wooden Box Co. v. Smith, 5 Ark. App. 14, 631 S.W.2d 620 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of filing a claim for additional benefits within the statute of limitations is upon the claimant. St. John v. Arkansas Lime Co., 8 Ark. App. 278, 651 S.W.2d 104 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claim was not an original claim for compensation and the employer was fully aware of the injury and its compensability, counsel's letter notifying the Workers' Compensation Commission that he had been employed to assist the claimant in connection with unpaid benefits, and listing the claimant's name, the employer's name, and the WCC file number was sufficient to constitute a claim for additional benefits. Cook v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 21 Ark. App. 29, 727 S.W.2d 862 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Period of limitations prescribed in subsection (b) is tolled where a person hired in Arkansas receives benefits under the law of another state where he is injured, but does not actively initiate the proceedings and remains unaware of the source of the payments. Haney v. Young Sales Corp., 22 Ark. App. 212, 737 S.W.2d 669 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Replacement medicine” is “medicine”, and therefore, payment for replacement medicine is “payment of compensation” within meaning of subsection (b) of this section. Furnishing of replacement medicine may toll running of statute, but if more than one year passes between furnishing of replacement medicine to claimant, a claim for additional compensation may well be barred by statute because such claims are not revived once statute has run. Evans v. Northwest Tire Serv., 23 Ark. App. 11, 740 S.W.2d 151 (1987), aff'd, Northwest Tire Serv. v. Evans, 295 Ark. 246, 748 S.W.2d 134 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the primary injury is shown to have arisen out of, and in the course of, the employment, the employer is responsible for every natural consequence that flows from that injury. If, after the period of initial disability has subsided, the injury flares up without an intervening cause and creates a second disability, it is a mere recurrence, and the employer remains liable if the claim is made within the greater of two years after the injury or one year after the date on which compensation was last paid. However, if the second period of disability is the result of a second incident which contributes independently to the injury, it is a new one for which the employer becomes liable, and the statute of limitations begins to run anew, even though the prior condition may contribute to a major part of the final condition. McDonald Equip. Co. v. Turner, 26 Ark. App. 264, 766 S.W.2d 936 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the date of the last payment of compensation under subsection (b), the date of receipt of the last payment rather than the due date is controlling. Myles v. Paragould Sch. Dist., 28 Ark. App. 81, 770 S.W.2d 675 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) governs only the time in which a claimant, suffering a recurrence of an earlier fully compensated “compensable injury,” must file a claim for “additional compensation.” Hall's Cleaners v. Wortham, 311 Ark. 103, 842 S.W.2d 7 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claim, filed after insurer discontinued payment of disability benefits in 1988, was one for enforcement of the commission's 1986 order, rather than a request for “additional” compensation, the claim was not barred by subsection (b) of this section. Helena Contracting Co. v. Williams, 45 Ark. App. 137, 872 S.W.2d 423 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's treatment by physician was not based on a valid referral and the claim for additional compensation was barred by the statute of limitations when it was filed more than one year after date of last compensation payment and more than two years after the injury. Pennington v. Gene Cosby Floor & Carpet, 51 Ark. App. 128, 911 S.W.2d 600 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A 1995 claim for medical benefits was a claim for “additional compensation” and was not merely a request to enforce a 1981 opinion, since all of the benefits and compensation awarded in the 1981 opinion were paid prior to the issuance of that opinion and the claimant neither sought nor required any further medical treatment between 1981 and 1995. Joe Brennan Gen. Contracting v. Adair, 62 Ark. App. 240, 971 S.W.2d 798 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's claim for additional compensation benefits following a knee replacement in 2003 for an injury that occurred in 1971 was not barred by the statute of limitations or by the doctrine of laches as the rehabilitation of employee's knee could not have been litigated earlier, and the limitations statute did not apply to replacement of the knee joint. Jones Truck Lines v. Pendergrass, 90 Ark. App. 402, 206 S.W.3d 272 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers' Compensation correctly determined that claimant's request for additional benefits was barred by the statute of limitations because he did not request his shoulder surgery until more than one year after the last payment of benefits. Eskola v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 93 Ark. App. 250, 218 S.W.3d 372 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in finding that subsection (b) of this section did not bar a worker's claim for additional benefits where the date of his last injections for left carpal tunnel syndrome was well within one year of the date the worker made his claim for additional benefits requesting release surgery.
   Nucor Yamato Steel Co. v. Kennedy, 2017 Ark. App. 126, 513 S.W.3d 895 (2017).
      </p>

       While claimant's medical treatment continued during a five-year gap in indemnity payments, the fact remained that the indemnity payments stopped for a period of five years before being resumed, and claimant failed to file any claim for benefits during that time; thus, claimant's claim for indemnity payments was barred under subdivision (b)(1) of this section by his failure to raise the claim within the appropriate period of time after his former employer ceased paying indemnity benefits, and the employer's gratuitous payment of indemnity benefits did not revive the statute of limitations.

       Under a plain reading of subsection (b) of this section, a workers'
   compensation claimant's application for additional medical benefits was not time-barred where there was no authority for the employer unilaterally imposing a pre-authorization condition on the benefits it provided for a compensable injury, the Commission's findings that the authorized treating physician's continued treatment in 2017 for claimant's right leg pain was reasonable and necessary and was sufficiently related to her right knee injury were supported by substantial evidence, and the claimant filed an application for additional benefits within one year of the 2017 treatment.

       Substantial evidence supported the decision that the claimant's bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was a compensable injury and the claim was not barred by the statute of limitations; the claimant's gradual-onset injury did not become apparent to the claimant until October 2013, when she reported work-related symptoms to her supervisor, she had been diagnosed with severe bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as she performed repetitive gripping at work, and she filed her workers'
   compensation claim no later than March 2014, and nothing indicated that the Workers'
   Compensation Commission used the manifestation approach that had previously been rejected by the court.

       Injury to claimant's eye was patent, not latent, and therefore, his claim for additional compensation for the complete loss of the eye was barred by the two-year statutory period of limitation from the date of the injury. Cornish Welding Shop v. Galbraith, 278 Ark. 185, 644 S.W.2d 926 (1983).

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the initial injury was a compensable one within the meaning of the act does not necessarily mean that the statute of limitations bars the claim at the end of two years from that date; where the full extent and nature of the injury are not known, nor reasonably ought to be known, until a later date, the running of the statute of limitations may be postponed under the latent injury rule.

       A work-related noise-induced hearing-loss injury does not become compensable until (1) the injury develops or becomes apparent and (2) the claimant suffers a loss in earnings on account of the injury, which loss is conclusively presumed; because the statute of limitation does not begin to run until both elements of the rule are met, and because of the conclusive presumption as to loss of earnings, which satisfies the second element, the statute of limitation with respect to work-related noise-induced hearing loss begins to run when the hearing loss becomes apparent to the claimant. 3M v.

       In the context of latent injuries, the appellate court found no language in Acts 1993, No. 796 that expressed a clear intention that it was to be applied retroactively, nor did the appellate court find that retroactive application of the Act was necessarily implied; thus, where employee had last received temporary total disability benefits for her wrist injury in 1994, and in 2000 she suffered additional complications when a pin was removed from her wrist (the pin was placed in her wrist shortly after the injury in 1992), she was entitled to have her claim for additional benefits considered under the law in effect at the time of her injury.

       Payment of wages to a disabled employee does not toll the statute unless the employer is aware or should be aware that it constitutes payment of compensation for the injury, and where the employee actually earns his wages by performing his regular duties after the injury, the presumption is that the wages are being paid for value received, and not in lieu of compensation.

       Where a claim for additional compensation was filed on January 14, 1992, and the injury occurred on October 26, 1987, obviously more than two years prior to the filing, the claim was not barred by the statute of limitations, because the employee's visit to his physician in September, 1991, tolled the statute for one year under subsection (b) of this section; the date of the last payment of compensation has been equated with the date of the furnishing of medical services.

      <p>
       Medical treatments received by the claimant in 1997 and 1998 following a 1992 injury did not toll the statute of limitations because there was substantial evidence to support the finding that the treatments at issue were related primarily to asthma and bronchitis and were not reasonably necessary in connection with her 1992 injuries.

       Employee's claim for additional benefits was barred as an initial claim for benefits was decided by a prior 2000 decision that was not appealed; the prior claim did not toll the statute of limitations in this section when employee made an additional claim for benefits in 2004.

       Prehearing order, which stated that a workers'

   Bryant Sch. Dist. v. Aylor, 2011 Ark. App. 173, 381 S.W.3d 895 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Worker's generic Form AR-C was insufficient to toll the limitations period in subsection (b) of this section where she did not specifically list that she suffered neck and shoulder injuries, chose to leave her claim for injuries open-ended, and by checking all the boxes on the form, she provided no information about the type of claim asserted.
   Wal-Mart Assocs. v. Armstrong, 2017 Ark. App. 175, 516 S.W.3d 310 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Letter that gave the commission claim number, referenced a denial of benefits, requested benefits, and asked for a hearing constituted a claim for benefits and tolled the statute of limitations; while it was not on a Commission-designated claim form (AR-C), there is no requirement in the Workers'
   Compensation Law that a claim for benefits be made on any particular form and the fact that there is no requirement to use a designated claim form indicates the legislature did not intend to create such a limitation.

       This section limits the two-year period from the date of the accident, and not from the date the injury was discovered. Furr v. Harding Glass Co., 240 Ark. 92, 398 S.W.2d 215 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of determining the limitations period on claims for additional compensation, injury means the state of facts which first entitled the claimant to compensation, so that if the injury does not develop until some time after the accident, the cause of action does not arise until the injury develops or becomes apparent. Cornish Welding Shop v. Galbraith, 278 Ark. 185, 644 S.W.2d 926 (1983); Freeman v. Tiffany Stand & Furn., 20 Ark. App. 183, 726 S.W.2d 294 (1987), appeal dismissed, American Mut. Ins. Co. v.

       The date of the accident and the date of the injury are not necessarily the same. St. John v. Arkansas Lime Co., 8 Ark. App. 278, 651 S.W.2d 104 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disability is defined as incapacity because of injury to earn, in the same or any other employment, the wages the employee was receiving at the time of his injury. Freeman v. Tiffany Stand & Furn., 20 Ark. App. 183, 726 S.W.2d 294 (1987), appeal dismissed, American Mut. Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., 801 S.W.2d 55 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The date of the accident and the date of the injury are not necessarily the same, because the time of the injury means a compensable injury, and an injury does not become compensable until the claimant suffers a loss in earnings.

       Claim for compensation for disability on account of an injury should be barred unless filed within two years of the compensable injury; the date of the compensable injury is defined as the date an injury was caused by an accident as set forth in subdivision (5).

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the claimant claimed that her last injurious mold exposure was in June 2011 because mold testing showed that mold levels were at acceptable levels, the statute is worded in terms of injurious exposure, and acceptable levels of mold would not be comparable to injurious exposure; the administrative law judge explained why he gave no real weight to the testing the claimant offered, and the decision that the claim was time-barred was affirmed.

       11-9-703. Preliminary conference procedure.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Workers' Compensation Commission is authorized and directed to promulgate appropriate rules to establish and implement, for claims with respect to injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1987, a preliminary conference procedure designed to accomplish the following objectives:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c09s11-9-703ol11">
       To provide the claimant an opportunity to confer with a legal advisor on the staff of the commission to be advised of his or her rights under this chapter and to ensure that the rights are protected. The conference shall be held in the county where the accident occurred, if the accident occurred in this state, unless otherwise agreed to between the parties, or otherwise directed by the commission;
      </li>
      <li id="t11c09s11-9-703ol12">
       To provide an opportunity for, but not to compel, a binding settlement of some or all the issues present at the time;
      </li>
      <li id="t11c09s11-9-703ol13">
       To facilitate the resolution of issues without the expense of litigation or attorney's fees for either party;

         <ol type="i">
          <li id="t11c09s11-9-703ol14Ai">
           To authorize the legal advisor to approve compromise settlements entered into at or as a result of the preliminary conference and those joint petition settlements entered into pursuant to § 11-9-805.
          </li>
          <li id="t11c09s11-9-703ol14ii">
           Provided, however, the same legal advisors shall not both advise the claimant and approve the joint petition.

         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t11c09s11-9-703ol14B">
         The purpose and intent of this section is to affirm the duty of the commission to provide legal assistance, thereby reducing litigation and workers' compensation costs; and

       By allowing the Workers' Compensation Commission to review the evidence or, if deemed advisable, hear the parties, their representatives, and witnesses, subsection (b)(6)(A) adequately protects a claimant's due process rights; thus, the commission does not err and violate a claimant's right to due process by substituting its own credibility determinations for that of the law judge. Stiger v. State Line Tire Serv., 72 Ark. App. 250, 35 S.W.3d 335 (2000).

      <p>
       Both the Commission and the court are required to construe the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act liberally, in accordance with its remedial purposes; however, liberal construction does not mean enlargement or restriction of any plain provision of the law. If a statutory provision is plain and unambiguous, it is the duty of the court to enforce it as it is written. Holiday Inn-West v. Coleman, 31 Ark. App. 224, 792 S.W.2d 345 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a condition is an injury or occupational disease, where the ambiguity of the statutory language permits alternative interpretations, the workers' compensation commission and courts should generally resolve the ambiguity in favor of claimants as mandated by subsection (c). Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Watkins, 31 Ark. App. 230, 792 S.W.2d 348 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' compensation statutes are to be liberally construed in accordance with the law's remedial purposes. Reeder v. Rheem Mfg. Co., 38 Ark. App. 248, 832 S.W.2d 505 (1992); Deffenbaugh Indus. v. Angus, 39 Ark. App. 24, 832 S.W.2d 869 (1992), aff'd, 313 Ark. 100, 852 S.W.2d 804 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “objective” in subdivision (c)(1) means based on observable phenomena. Keller v. L.A. Darling Fixtures, 40 Ark. App. 94, 845 S.W.2d 15 (1992), superseded by statute as stated in, Swift-Eckrich, Inc. v. Brock, 63 Ark. App. 118, 975 S.W.2d 857 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       When considering the requirement under subdivision (c)(1) that “any determination of physical impairment shall be supported by objective and measurable physical or mental findings,” the word “determination” refers to the Workers' Compensation Commission's determination. Keller v. L.A. Darling Fixtures, 40 Ark. App. 94, 845 S.W.2d 15 (1992), superseded by statute as stated in, Swift-Eckrich, Inc. v. Brock, 63 Ark. App. 118, 975 S.W.2d 857 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       An initiative petition filed under Ark. Const. Amend. 7 was insufficient because the ballot title was misleading due to various omissions and misstatements in its terms, particularly with respect to its hidden amendments of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-715" target="_self">11-9-715</a></cite>, regarding attorney's fees, and this section, regarding the construction of this chapter. Bailey v. McCuen, 318 Ark. 277, 884 S.W.2d 938 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative law judges, the Commission, and any reviewing courts are to construe this chapter strictly. Amlease, Inc. v. Kuligowski, 59 Ark. App. 261, 957 S.W.2d 715 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the 1993 amendment of this section, workers' compensation provisions were construed liberally. Lawhon Farm Servs. v. Brown, 60 Ark. App. 64, 958 S.W.2d 538 (1997), aff'd, 335 Ark. 272, 984 S.W.2d 1 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though it was true that the Workers' Compensation Act had to be strictly construed, that construction had to take into account the express purpose of the act which was to pay benefits to all legitimately injured workers suffering an injury on the job in order to enable them to return to the work force; thus, the claimant was entitled to benefits where he requested that the employer provide medical benefits, the employer refused to do so, and the worker stayed on the job and tried to work through the pain since the worker did not “return to work” as that term was contemplated under the act. Farmers Coop. v. Biles, 77 Ark. App. 1, 69 S.W.3d 899 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Strict construction of Acts 1993, No. 793, does not require that courts review workers' compensation claims and appeals as simply a matter of determining whether the worker was performing a job task when the accident occurred; rather, courts must determine whether an injury occurred within the time and space boundaries of the employment, when the employee was carrying out the employer's purpose or advancing the employer's interest directly or indirectly. Wallace v. West Fraser South, Inc., 365 Ark. 68, 225 S.W.3d 361 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to establish liability on the part of a freight lessor, a freight carrier, and a healthcare company under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-105ol1b" target="_self">11-9-105(b)</a></cite>, a truck driver, who injured his back while disconnecting a trailer from his truck, was required to demonstrate negligence on their part since, under the plain meaning of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-105ol1b" target="_self">11-9-105(b)</a></cite>, the no-fault theory of workers'
   compensation did not carry over to suits filed in tort. The statute did not state that suits filed in tort were to be based on a theory of strict liability, and under the rule of strict construction, no such intent could be inferred.
   Sykes v. Williams, 373 Ark. 236, 283 S.W.3d 209 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in finding that the claim for additional benefits was barred by the statute of limitations, because the conclusion that the entry of the agreed order resolved the request for additional benefits and effectively adjudicated the claim for additional benefits ignored the statutory language allowing for an injured employee to pursue additional benefits when the need indisputably arose within the statutory framework; the case was never dismissed pursuant to § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-702ol1d" target="_self">11-9-702(d)</a></cite>, and the agreed order granted a continuing award of benefits which included the physician referral.
   Curtis v. Big Lots, 2009 Ark. App. 292, 307 S.W.3d 37 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Construing the provisions of the Workers'
   Compensation Act strictly, the Workers'
   Compensation Commission abused its discretion in dismissing as untimely a worker's pro se notice of appeal from an order of an administrative law judge (ALJ) denying permanent total disability for carpal tunnel injuries because the ALJ's order could not become final under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-711ol1a1" target="_self">11-9-711(a)(1)</a></cite> until 30 days after the worker received a copy where the worker's attorney was disbarred 26 days after receiving a copy and thus did not have a full 30 days to appeal.

       Subdivision (c)(3), which was added by Acts 1986 (2nd Ex.

       On appellate review of workers' compensation cases, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the findings of the commission and given its strongest probative value in favor of its order; the extent of inquiry is to determine if the finding of the commission is supported by substantial evidence. Even where a preponderance of the evidence might indicate a contrary result, the court will affirm if reasonable minds could reach the commission's conclusion. Barrett v. Arkansas Rehabilitation Servs., 10 Ark. App. 102, 661 S.W.2d 439 (1983); Legacy Lodge Nursing Home v. McKellar, 26 Ark. App. 260, 763 S.W.2d 101 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a determination of an administrative law judge is appealed to the commission, the commission does not sit as an appellate court to review the administrative law judge's findings; instead, the commission makes a de novo determination of the facts, and it is the commission's duty to make findings in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence and not to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the administrative law judge. Woods v. Best Western, 32 Ark. App. 196, 799 S.W.2d 565 (1990).

       The Court of Appeals may, and should, upon its own motion, certify to the Supreme Court any appeal it finds to be excepted from its jurisdiction by Rule 1-2 of the Rules of the Supreme Court or to involve an issue of significant public interest or a legal principle of major importance, but if the case had been appealed to the Court of Appeals from the Workers' Compensation Commission, the case could not have been certified or transferred to the Supreme Court prior to a decision having been made by the Court of Appeals. Houston Contracting Co. v. Young, 267 Ark. 44, 589 S.W.2d 9 (1979).
      </p>

       When a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission is appealed to the Court of Appeals, that court gives no weight to the findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Disheroon, 26 Ark. App. 145, 761 S.W.2d 617 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In workers' compensation cases, the commission conducts a de novo review of the record; it is not its function to review the decision made by the administrative law judge for error. On appeal to the court of appeals, the court reviews the decision of the commission and not that of the administrative law judge; thus, where there is no error in the proceedings before the commission, as opposed to the administrative law judge, the judgment of the commission will be affirmed.

       On appeal, the court is required to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the commission's decision and uphold it if it is supported by substantial evidence; before it reverses a decision of the commission, it must be convinced that fair-minded persons, with the same facts before them, could not have reached the conclusion arrived at by the commission.

       On appeal of a workers' compensation case from the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the commission's decision and affirms that decision if it is supported by substantial evidence; thus, before the Supreme Court will reverse the commission's decision, it must be convinced that fair-minded persons considering the same facts could not have reached the conclusion made by the commission.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission had a substantial basis for denial of permanent disability benefits as the Commission's decision that the employee was not permanently disabled was based upon the fact that the impairment rating assigned by his treating physician was not supported by objective measurable physical findings and that the opinion of another physician, who evaluated the employee once, was entitled to greater weight as it was consistent with functional capacity evaluations performed on the employee.

      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'

       The commission could reasonably infer from the evidence that, at the time of the plane crash, the decedent was performing one of the duties of his employment in inspecting farm crops while returning from a plane trip of a personal nature. While it was true that no one could be absolutely certain what the decedent was doing at the time of his death, absolute certainty is not required. Franklin Collier Farms v. Bullard, 33 Ark.

       The Worker's Compensation Commission did not err in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in connection with the establishment by the employee of a causal connection between the false representation by the employee claimant on her employment application and the subsequent injury to the employee; there is no rule that an employer must prove a causal connection between the misrepresentation and the injury by clear and convincing evidence. Tahutini v. Tastybird Foods, 18 Ark. App. 82, 711 S.W.2d 173 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 1986 (2nd Ex. Sess.), No. 10 which added the language of subdivision (c)(3) effected a procedural change and not a substantive change regarding the burden of proof. Rule of liberal construction as it existed prior to the 1986 amendment to this section was not a substitute for a claimant's burden of establishing an injury by a preponderance of the evidence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Before the 1986 amendment to subsections (b) and (c), it was the rule that the Workers' Compensation Commission, in making a factual determination, was to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt. But this rule requiring the commission to resolve doubtful cases in favor of the claimant did not mean that a claimant did not have the burden of proving his case by a preponderance of the evidence. Fowler v. McHenry, 22 Ark. App. 196, 737 S.W.2d 663 (1987).

       The characterization of claimant's injury affects the burden of proof. If claimant's condition is an “injury,” she has the burden of proving that it arose out of and in the course of her employment by a preponderance of the evidence; but if her condition is an “occupational disease,” a causal connection between the employment and the disease must be established by clear and convincing evidence.

      <p>
       If there is no requirement in subdivision (c)(1) that the award of temporary total disability must be supported by objective and measurable findings of physical impairment, then the absence of factual findings by the Commission on that point does not prevent the determination of the Commission, that employee suffered a compensable injury, from being affirmed.

       Workers' Compensation Commission did not disagree with employer's finding that, using AMA's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides) the employee was entitled to a 24 percent impairment rating for a total shoulder arthroplasty and a 10 percent impairment rating for a distal clavicle arthroplasty, or that these ratings combined to produce an impairment rating of 32 percent, however, the employer had misinterpreted Table 27 of the AMA Guides as assigning impairment values only to the shoulder joint, when Table 27 instead assigned impairment values from arthroplasty of specific bones and joints to the entire upper extremity.

       Absent a showing that the Workers' Compensation Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously, or abused its discretion, a determination made by the commission not to reopen a case will not be disturbed. Walker v. J & J Pest Control, 6 Ark. App. 171, 639 S.W.2d 748 (1982).

       Where the claimant filed a petition for a rehearing of the denial of disability benefits on the ground that there had been newly discovered evidence, but it appeared that all of the evidence which the claimant alleged was newly discovered evidence was actually within the knowledge of the claimant before the case was submitted to and decided by the commission, the motion for a rehearing was properly denied.

       Subdivision (b)(6) of this section clearly allows for oral argument only when the commission deems it advisable. Bartlett v. Mead Containerboard, 47 Ark. App. 181, 888 S.W.2d 314 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant requested oral argument but failed to notify the commission as to why one was desired, the commission had no basis upon which to deem an oral argument advisable because no reason was given as to why the case could not be decided on the proof presented to the administrative law judge.

      <p>
       By reserving the issue of whether the employee was entitled to temporary total disability benefits, the commission simply declined to say that the employee failed to meet her burden of proof on this issue, and this constituted error on the part of the commission, as the workers' compensation statute states that the evidence shall be weighed impartially, and without giving the benefit of the doubt to any party. Gencorp Polymer Prods. v. Landers, 36 Ark. App. 190, 820 S.W.2d 475 (1991).

       The specific authority to investigate claims granted to the Commission by subdivision (b)(1) of this section carries also the authority to make such orders and impose such sanctions as are reasonably necessary to carry out that purpose.

        “Physical Impairment”.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The reference to “physical impairment” in subdivision (c)(1) of this section refers to a determination of anatomical disability as opposed to a loss of a wage earning capacity under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-522ol1b" target="_self">11-9-522(b)</a></cite>. Arkansas Methodist Hosp. v. Adams, 43 Ark. App. 1, 858 S.W.2d 125 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “anatomical impairment” means the anatomical loss as reflected by the common usage of medical impairment ratings; wage-loss disability is something entirely different. Foxx v. American Transp., 54 Ark. App. 115, 924 S.W.2d 814 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission wrongfully denied employee permanent disability benefits where there were objective findings to support an impairment; spinal stenosis, or narrowing of the spine, was detected on a myelogram and CT scan, and such a finding clearly was not within the voluntary control of the patient. Pollard v. Meridian Aggregates, 88 Ark. App. 1, 193 S.W.3d 738 (2004).

       The Workers' Compensation Commission is vested with discretion in determining whether and under what circumstances a case appealed to them should be remanded for the taking of additional evidence; on appeal an exercise of that discretion will not be lightly disturbed. A case should only be remanded if the new discovered evidence is relevant, is not merely cumulative, would change the result, and was diligently discovered and produced by the movant.

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission acted within its discretion in affirming the administrative law judge's (ALJ) denial of the claimant's motion for a continuance because the claimant failed to present evidence to demonstrate his assertion that claimants had an absolute right to obtain a dismissal without prejudice, notwithstanding the language in the ALJ's prehearing order stating that the hearing schedules would be changed only for good cause. The ALJ allowed the claimant additional time to take his treating physician's deposition and it was entered into the record; the proffered testimony from the only missing witnesses at the hearing was deemed as having no bearing on the facts that would determine compensability.

       The Workers' Compensation Commission is not an appellate court, but the factfinder, and its duty and statutory obligation is to make specific findings of fact, on de novo review based on the record as a whole, and to decide the issues before it by determining whether the party having the burden of proof on an issue has established it by a preponderance of the evidence.

   Compensation Commission (Commission) to, sua sponte, order an independent medical examination (IME) after the parties had litigated compensability and additional benefits; these statutes did not give the Commission authority to reserve making determinations on compensability and additional benefits when those were the only issues litigated by the parties, and the Commission did not err in finding that the administrative law judge exceeded his authority when he ordered an IME.

       Where the employee sought workers'
   compensation benefits for a left-knee injury, the decision to admit a belated MRI report was entirely within the ALJ's discretion, and he did not abuse that discretion under subdivision (c)(3) of this section. The employee had a good reason for waiting until after the first hearing to undergo an MRI; the employee could not afford it until then.

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in holding that an employee was entitled to implantation of a dorsal-column stimulator if additional testing and examination showed it to be necessary because the finding that another evaluation needed to occur was a tacit admission that the record did not contain evidence sufficient under subdivision (c)(1) of this section to rule outright that additional treatment was reasonable and necessary.

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the Arkansas Workers'

       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not err in denying the admission of evidence appellants proffered because its determination that appellants were not diligent was not an abuse of discretion; appellants had ample opportunity to offer proof to support their case at the initial hearing before the administrative law judge, but the evidence was not proffered until the case was remanded on appeal.

       On an appeal to the full commission presented solely on the transcript of the record made before the referee, it is the duty of the commission to make a finding according to the preponderance of the evidence, and not merely whether there is substantial evidence to support the finding of the referee, and the commission may pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.

       The commission is not bound by strict rules of evidence in the admission or consideration of any evidence, including medical testimony; it has broad discretion with reference to admission of evidence, and it is free to make such inquiry and to conduct the proceedings in such a manner as to best ascertain the rights of the parties.

      <p>
       Where at second hearing the judge considered two documents that had not previously been introduced into evidence and did not notify the parties until after the final hearing that he intended to make the documents a part of the record, the claimant was effectively denied a hearing concerning the documents admitted and considered by the judge and was thereby precluded from cross-examining the individuals who completed the two exhibits; consequently, decision denying benefits must be reversed and remanded.

       Under subsection (c) of this section, the judge has discretion to order further hearings for the purpose of introducing additional evidence, even though this section directs that each party must present all evidence at the initial hearing; thus, if an administrative law judge can order additional evidentiary hearings, a fortiori, the judge necessarily should have the power and discretion to reserve his or her decision on a related issue which might be affected by any additional evidence.

       Substantial evidence supported Workers' Compensation Commission's finding that claimant acted diligently in obtaining the additional medical evidence and that claimant sustained a compensable injury; the December 2001 MRI report and the February 2002 operative report, both introduced at the second hearing, constituted sufficient evidence to uphold the findings.

      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission was correct in refusing to allow the claimant to present new evidence contained in six depositions because the claimant failed to demonstrate the evidence's relevancy; the evidence in the depositions related solely to the claimant's vague constitutional arguments that had no bearing on whether his injury was compensable and the evidence did not suggest that political pressure caused the administrative law judge to treat the claimant's case unfairly. The claimant also failed to demonstrate that the evidence he sought to introduce would have produced a different result.

       There was no statutory requirement that a benefits claimant request a hearing on the introduction of additional evidence or that the Workers'
   Compensation Commission conduct a hearing before allowing such. Therefore, the Commission did not abuse its discretion in admitting newly generated medical records as additional evidence in this case; the records were not cumulative and they were relevant, particularly with regards to an evaluation of the claimant's left-knee pain and resultant surgery.

       Inasmuch as the commission was not bound by Civil Rules of Evidence in its admission and consideration of evidence, the commission was within its discretion in hearing the testimony of a doctor on the issue of whether an employee's fatal heart attack was the result of his employment, despite the fact that the testimony was in conflict with the opinions of more celebrated experts.

       Although the commission's knowledge and experience is not evidence, once it has before it firm medical evidence of physical impairment and functional limitation it has the advantage of its own superior knowledge of industrial demands, limitations and requirements and can apply its knowledge and expertise in weighing the medical evidence of functional limitations together with other evidence of the manner in which the functional disability will affect the ability of an injured employee to obtain or hold a job and thereby arrive at reasonably accurate conclusions as to the extent of injury.

   Compensation Commission did not arbitrarily disregard the treating physician's opinion, but rather, it was just not given as much weight as the opinion of the doctor who prepared the independent medical examination report; the Commission's reliance on the video surveillance of the employee carrying grocery sacks showed that the choice of the doctor's opinion over that of the treating physician was based on the record as a whole and on a determination of the employee's credibility.

       Workers'

       In compensation proceeding, the burden was on the employer to show that employee's death resulted solely from his intoxicated condition. Elm Springs Canning Co. v. Sullins, 207 Ark. 257, 180 S.W.2d 113 (1944); Cox Bros. Lumber Co. v. Jones, 220 Ark. 431, 248 S.W.2d 91 (1952) (preceding cases decided under prior law).

       Employer held liable for compensation as result of watchman being hit by train even though watchman had been drinking, if reason for watchman being hit by train was entirely speculative. Cox Bros. Lumber Co. v. Jones, 220 Ark. 431, 248 S.W.2d 91 (1952) (decision under prior law).

       Presumption against intoxication as cause of injury was overcome where there was testimony as to the deceased's blood-alcohol level and no proof of another cause of the automobile accident. Goza v. Central Ark. Dev. Council, Inc., 254 Ark. 694, 496 S.W.2d 388 (1973).

      <p>
       Prior to 1993, there was a prima facie presumption under former subdivision (4) of this section that an injury did not result from intoxication of the injured employee while on duty; now however, under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol15Biv" target="_self">11-9-102(5)(B)(iv)</a></cite> (now §
   <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol14" target="_self">11-9-102(4)</a></cite>), the presence of an intoxicant creates a rebuttable presumption that the injury or accident was substantially occasioned by the use of the intoxicant. Weaver v. Whitaker Furn. Co., 55 Ark. App. 400, 935 S.W.2d 584 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Until 1993, a prima facie presumption existed that an injury did not result from intoxication of the injured employee while on duty; Acts 1993, No. 796 changed that presumption by deleting former subdivision (4) of this section and amending § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-102ol15Biv" target="_self">11-9-102(5)(B)(iv)</a></cite> (now §

       The Workers' Compensation Commission had jurisdiction to decide whether there was a workers' compensation policy in force at the time of the injury of farmworker and weather such worker was an employee. Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co. v. Tuggle, 270 Ark. 106, 603 S.W.2d 452 (1980).

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence held sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption of jurisdiction where (1) the claimant truck driver testified that she resided in Alabama, that she was hired in Georgia, and that her employer was located in Texas, and (2) the employer stipulated that it did not have an office or employees in Arkansas and the claimant did not disagree with that stipulation. Baker v. Frozen Food Express Transp., 63 Ark. App. 100, 974 S.W.2d 487 (1998), substituted opinion, 981 S.W.2d 101 (Ark. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption of jurisdiction was rebutted where the injured truck driver's sole connection with Arkansas was that the accident occurred in Arkansas and the employer's sole connections were the existence of a designated fuel stop and an unsupervised drop yard in Arkansas; the employment relationship was entered into in Georgia, the driver was paid from Texas, the driver carried out her duties throughout the United States and Canada, and she was a resident of Alabama.

        Note.
       </b>
       Prior to the 1976 amendment, appeals from commission orders were made to the circuit court. The 1976 amendment provided for appeals directly to the Supreme Court. Since the 1979 amendments, appeals have been made to the Court of Appeals. These changes should be kept in mind with respect to the following notes.

      <p>
       Former provision for automatic affirmance of the award of the Workers' Compensation Commission upon failure of the circuit court to reverse, modify, or remand the award or to set it aside within 60 days was unconstitutional as a usurpation of a judicial function by the legislature. Sands v. Albert Pike Motor Hotel, 245 Ark. 755, 434 S.W.2d 288 (1968) (decision prior to 1976 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former provision allowing direct appeal of cases from the commission to the Supreme Court, was unconstitutional under Ark. Const., Art. 7, § 4 which provides that the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction only. Ward School Bus Mfg., Inc. v. Fowler, 261 Ark. 100, 547 S.W.2d 394 (1977) (decision prior to 1979 amendments).
      </p>
      <p>
       By allowing the Workers' Compensation Commission to review the evidence or, if deemed advisable, hear the parties, their representatives, and witnesses, § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-704ol1b6A" target="_self">11-9-704(b)(6)(A)</a></cite> adequately protects a claimant's due process rights; thus, the commission does not err and violate a claimant's right to due process by substituting its own credibility determinations for that of the law judge. Stiger v. State Line Tire Serv., 72 Ark. App. 250, 35 S.W.3d 335 (2000).

       Where the finding of an administrative law judge is supported by substantial evidence, the rule is well settled that the Court of Appeals will affirm such a finding on appeal. Saint Vincent Infirmary v. Carpenter, 268 Ark. 951, 597 S.W.2d 126 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The duty of the Workers' Compensation Commission is to make a finding in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence and not on whether there is any substantial evidence to support the findings of the administrative law judge. Oller v. Champion Parts Rebuilders, Inc., 5 Ark. App. 307, 635 S.W.2d 276 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission is appealed to the Court of Appeals, no weight is given to the findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge. Smart v. Biggs, 26 Ark. App. 141, 760 S.W.2d 882 (1988).

       Right of appeal from final award is not lost by failure to appeal from temporary and provisional award. Caddo Quicksilver Corp. v. Barber, 204 Ark. 985, 166 S.W.2d 1 (1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court without reservation could accept the evidence that a letter was properly addressed and stamped to the Workers' Compensation Commission and duplicate letters or copies of the original mailed to other parties; while this evidence of itself raised a presumption factually that the letter evincing a desire to appeal from award made by the referee was received, this presumption disappeared and was dissolved when the receipt of the letter was denied by the addressee, Workers' Compensation Commission. Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Martin, 229 Ark. 1065, 320 S.W.2d 266 (1959).

      </p>
      <p>
       The commission order setting aside a judgment for the claimants and opening up the record for the taking of additional evidence, was not a final order which was appealable. Cooper Indus. Prods. v. Meadows, 269 Ark. 966, 601 S.W.2d 275 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not state the award becomes final only after 30 days, but rather that it shall become final unless some action is taken by either or both parties to the dispute to prevent the order from becoming final. Arkansas State Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. Godwin, 270 Ark. 743, 606 S.W.2d 127 (1980); White v. Air Sys., Inc., 33 Ark. App. 56, 800 S.W.2d 726 (1990).

      <p>
       Opinion of administrative law judge, which was filed and from which no appeal was taken within the 30-day requirement, became a final order or award, and “amended opinion” filed two months later did not amend the first opinion. Colson Co. v. Fields, 20 Ark. App. 187, 726 S.W.2d 296 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of the Worker Compensation Commission is ordinarily reviewable only at the point where it awards or denies compensation. Mid-State Constr. v. Sealy, 26 Ark. App. 186, 761 S.W.2d 951 (1988); TEC v. Falkner, 38 Ark. App. 13, 827 S.W.2d 661 (1992).

       Worker's Compensation Commission's jurisdictional finding was purely an incidental issue and was not appealable. Mid-State Constr. v. Sealy, 26 Ark. App. 186, 761 S.W.2d 951 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court order remanding case for administrative law judge to determine claimant's appropriate wage rate and periods of temporary total disability, and to make an award in accordance with those determinations, is not a final order and is not appealable. American Mut. Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., 801 S.W.2d 55 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for the court to review a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission, the order from which the parties appeal must be final; thus, where a claim that is remanded to the law judge by the commission for the taking of additional evidence and one that does not award compensation for monetary benefits must be dismissed by the court for lack of a final order. Humphrey v. Faulkner Nursing Ctr., 61 Ark. App. 48, 964 S.W.2d 224 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Worker's appeal from the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds because the Commission had not yet entered a final order in the worker's case; although the Commission had rejected the worker's claim that she had suffered additional compensable injuries, it had not resolved her claims for additional medical treatment and for temporary total disability benefits in connection with the compensable injuries that she suffered to her left ankle and foot.

       Due process of law dictates that an employee who has been denied benefits should be afforded the same opportunity to have his claim reconsidered where he has discovered subsequently to the denial of benefits that his was a meritorious claim. Walker v. J & J Pest Control, 270 Ark. 941, 606 S.W.2d 597 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this chapter does not provide for rehearing or reconsideration procedures, the commission does have the authority under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-713" target="_self">11-9-713</a></cite> to modify a final award, but only upon a showing of a change in physical condition or proof of an assignment of an erroneous wage rate. Cooper Indus. Prods. v. Meadows, 5 Ark. App. 205, 634 S.W.2d 400 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an administrative law judge filed an opinion denying claimant additional benefits and claimant did not file a timely appeal from that order, a subsequent attempt by the administrative law judge to amend his original order and award benefits to the claimant based on a doctor's clarification of the claimant's disability was improper, because the order denying benefits became final when no appeal was sought within 30 days. Cooper Indus. Prods. v. Meadows, 5 Ark. App. 205, 634 S.W.2d 400 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctrine of res judicata, forbidding the reopening of matters once judicially determined by competent authority, applies to the decisions of the Workers' Compensation Commission; having once determined that the claimant only suffered a 55% permanent disability to the body as a whole, the commission cannot 12 years later say that the claimant was totally disabled at that earlier time.

       Where award was not made until one and one half years after death, claimants could not request Supreme Court to allow interest from date of death because of the delay where no interest was allowed in award, the circuit court affirmed the award with interest from date of final award and no appeal was prosecuted on the question of interest.

       Where the Workers' Compensation Commission made no findings as to whether the claimant sustained a compensable injury, or when the healing period ended if there was a compensable injury, or whether she was disabled at the time of the hearing, and if so, what was the cause of disability, the Court of Appeals was unable to tell from the record upon what factual basis the claim was denied and whether the commission erred in its application of the law; therefore, reversal and remand was appropriate. Wright v. American Transp., 18 Ark. App. 18, 709 S.W.2d 107 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In considering an appeal from a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission on the sufficiency of the evidence, the Court of Appeals reviews the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the commission's findings; and the court must uphold the commission's findings if there is any substantial evidence to support them, even if the preponderance of the evidence would indicate a different result. Tahutini v. Tastybird Foods, 18 Ark. App. 82, 711 S.W.2d 173 (1986); Smart v. Biggs, 26 Ark. App. 141, 760 S.W.2d 882 (1988); Bates v. Frost Logging Co., 38 Ark. App. 36, 827 S.W.2d 664 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to reverse a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission, the Court of Appeals must be convinced that fair-minded persons, with the same facts before them, could not have reached the conclusion arrived at by the commission; the question is not whether the evidence would support findings contrary to those made by the commission, but whether the evidence supports the findings made by the commission. Franklin Collier Farms v. Chapple, 18 Ark. App. 200, 712 S.W.2d 334 (1986); Public Employee Claims Div. v. Tiner, 37 Ark. App. 23, 822 S.W.2d 400 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The findings of the Workers' Compensation Commission must be upheld unless there is no substantial evidence to support them. Price v. Little Rock Packaging Co., 42 Ark. App. 238, 856 S.W.2d 317 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The appellate court will not reverse a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission unless convinced that fair-minded persons with the same facts before them could not have reached the conclusion arrived at by the Commission. Price v. Little Rock Packaging Co., 42 Ark. App. 238, 856 S.W.2d 317 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       When reviewing a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission on appeal, the appellate court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commission's findings and affirm if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. Beeson v. Landcoast, 43 Ark. App. 132, 862 S.W.2d 846 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appellate review, the duty of the court is to review questions of law only. Harvest Foods v. Washam, 52 Ark. App. 72, 914 S.W.2d 776 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       The substantial evidence test applicable for judicial review of a commission decision means that the commission should not be reversed unless it is clear that fair-minded persons could not have reached the same result if presented with the same facts; the substantial evidence standard of appellate review means that the appellate court must affirm the commission if fair-minded people could have reached the same result after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the result that the commission reached. Hubley v. Best Western-Governor's Inn, 52 Ark. App. 226, 916 S.W.2d 143 (1996), superseded by statute as stated in, Service Chevrolet v. Atwood, 61 Ark. App. 190, 966 S.W.2d 909 (1998).

       Employer's delay in paying the filing fee for an appeal did not extend or delay the deadline for lodging the record with the appellate court as nothing in either § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-711ol1b1C" target="_self">11-9-711(b)(1)(C)</a></cite> or Ark. Workers'

      <p>
       There is no requirement in the Workers' Compensation Act that the court, on review of the commission's decisions, make detailed findings of fact or state specific conclusions of law. Clark v. Peabody Testing Serv., 265 Ark. 489, 579 S.W.2d 360 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is the function of the Workers' Compensation Commission, and not the appellate courts, to act as fact finder in workers' compensation cases, it is the duty of the appellate court to reverse the Commission's decision when convinced that fair-minded persons, with the same facts before them, could not have reached the conclusion arrived at by the Commission. Moser v. Arkansas Lime Co., 40 Ark. App. 113, 846 S.W.2d 188 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the commission denies compensation, it is required to make findings sufficient to justify that denial, containing all the specific facts relevant to the contested issue so the reviewing court may determine whether the commission has resolved these issues in conformity with the law. Shelton v. Freeland Pulpwood, 53 Ark. App. 16, 918 S.W.2d 206 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the commission adopted the opinion of the Administrative Law Judge as its own and where that opinion was almost exclusively a recitation of testimony, rather than findings based on that testimony, the commission failed to make specific findings of the fact on which it relied to support its decision. Shelton v. Freeland Pulpwood, 53 Ark. App. 16, 918 S.W.2d 206 (1996).

       Where court had remanded case to commission to obtain additional evidence since it felt that there was insufficient evidence to allow claim but that the evidence was not sufficient to justify denial of claim, it was proper for court to remand the case a second time for a complete investigation as to whether or not claimant's injury arose out of and in the course of his employment and whether or not he suffered from an occupational disease. Ward Furn. Mfg. Co. v. Reather, 234 Ark. 151, 350 S.W.2d 691 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court had no authority to determine the amount of the award and should remand the cause to the commission for the determination of the proper award. W.C. Burrow Constr. Co. v. Langley, 238 Ark. 992, 386 S.W.2d 484 (1965) (decision prior to 1976 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the administrative law judge summarized the testimony of the witnesses and did not make findings of fact based on that testimony, the court of appeals could not ascertain whether the commission correctly applied the law in denying benefits and therefore remanded the case for the commission to make specific findings of fact upon which it relied in making its decision. Hardin v. Southern Compress Co., 34 Ark. App. 208, 810 S.W.2d 501 (1991).

       Findings of the commission will not be disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence. West v. Smith, 225 Ark. 365, 282 S.W.2d 597 (1955); Hixson Coal Co. v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence insufficient to sustain commission's findings. Hall v. Pittman Constr. Co., 235 Ark. 104, 357 S.W.2d 263 (1962); Dena Constr. Co. v. Herndon, 264 Ark. 791, 575 S.W.2d 155 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In reviewing the findings of fact of the commission on appeal, the court is limited to the sole determination of whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence. Hughes v. Tapley, 206 Ark. 739, 177 S.W.2d 429 (1944), overruled in part, Southern Cotton Oil Div. v. Childress, 237 Ark. 909, 377 S.W.2d 167 (Ark. 1964) (decision under prior law); Tiner v. Baldwin, 235 Ark. 1010, 363 S.W.2d 532 (1963); Lybrand v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., 266 Ark. 946, 588 S.W.2d 449 (Ct. App. 1979); Dedmon v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 3 Ark. App. 108, 623 S.W.2d 207 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission on fact questions carries the same force and effect as a jury verdict, and even though the evidence would support another conclusion, or if the preponderance of the evidence would indicate a different result, the court will still affirm the commission if reasonable minds could reach the conclusion reached by the commission. King v. Farmers Liquid Fertilizer, 267 Ark. 798, 590 S.W.2d 327 (Ct. App. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Court of Appeals does not interfere with the actions of the commission unless it finds that the commission has acted without or in excess of its authority, or that its order is not supported by substantial evidence. Allen Canning Co. v. McReynolds, 5 Ark. App. 78, 632 S.W.2d 450 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal the Court of Appeals reviews the record only to determine if the commission's findings are supported by such substantial, relevant evidence as reasonable minds might accept as adequate to support their conclusion. Morrow v. Mulberry Lumber Co., 5 Ark. App. 260, 635 S.W.2d 283 (1982); Stephens v. St. Vincent Infirmary, 15 Ark. App. 209, 691 S.W.2d 190 (1985); Snow v. Alcoa, 15 Ark. App. 205, 691 S.W.2d 194 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question presented to the Court of Appeals on reviewing a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission is not whether the evidence would support findings contrary to those made by the commission, but whether the evidence supports the findings made by the commission; even if the decision of the commission is against the preponderance of the evidence, the Court of Appeals will not reverse where its decision is supported by substantial evidence. Snow v. Alcoa, 15 Ark. App. 205, 691 S.W.2d 194 (1985); Osage Oil Co. v. Rogers, 15 Ark. App. 319, 692 S.W.2d 786 (1985). But see Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988); Southland Corp. v. Magers, 15 Ark. App. 360, 695 S.W.2d 380 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the denial of relief is based on the claimant's failure to prove entitlement by the preponderance of the evidence, the substantial evidence standard of review requires the court to affirm if the Commission's opinion displays a substantial basis for the denial of relief. Day v. Central Day Care, Inc., 38 Ark. App. 241, 833 S.W.2d 783 (1992); Barnard v. B & M Constr., 52 Ark. App. 61, 915 S.W.2d 296 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence is that relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; the issue is not whether the appellate court might have reached a different result from that reached by the commission, or whether the evidence would have supported a contrary finding, but rather if reasonable minds could reach the result shown by the commission's decision, we must affirm the decision. Harvest Foods v. Washam, 52 Ark. App. 72, 914 S.W.2d 776 (1996).
      </p>

       Workers'
   Compensation Commission exceeded its authority in concluding that a firefighter had not sustained a brain injury or dysphasia where only the degree of impairment, not the existence of an injury, was in dispute.

      <p>
       Scintilla of evidence rule does not apply to a review of compensation award, and in such cases it is a question of law whether there is substantial evidence to warrant finding, but the question of the weight of the evidence is a question of fact and not of law. J.L. Williams & Sons v. Smith, 205 Ark. 604, 170 S.W.2d 82 (1943) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conflicting testimony presents a fact question for the commission's determination and when supported by substantial testimony is to be viewed on appeal in favor of the finding. Grimsley v. Manufacturers Furn. Co., 224 Ark. 769, 276 S.W.2d 64 (1955); Hollifield v. Bird & Son, 227 Ark. 703, 301 S.W.2d 27 (1957); McKamie v. Kern-Trimble Drilling Co., 229 Ark. 86, 313 S.W.2d 378 (1958); Kivett v. Redmond Co., 234 Ark. 855, 355 S.W.2d 172 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of evidence to support commission's findings of fact is a question of law. West v. Smith, 225 Ark. 365, 282 S.W.2d 597 (1955); Hixson Coal Co. v. Furstenberg, 225 Ark. 568, 284 S.W.2d 120 (1955); Boyd Excelsior Fuel Co. v. McKown, 226 Ark. 174, 288 S.W.2d 614 (1956); Johnson Auto Co. v. Kelley, 228 Ark. 364, 307 S.W.2d 867 (1957); Cummings v. United Motor Exch., Inc., 236 Ark. 735, 368 S.W.2d 82 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       When there is doubt remaining as to a factual issue, and the doubt has been caused by conflicting or equivocal testimony, for the reviewing court to hold that the resolution of that doubt by the commission must always favor the claimant is to rob the commission of its fact-finding function which is definitively prescribed by the statute. Johnson v. Valmac Indus., 269 Ark. 626, 599 S.W.2d 440 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission has the right to find the facts, but that right carries with it the duty to make and set out the crucial findings of fact and the supporting evidence. McCoy v. Buckeye Cotton Oil, 271 Ark. 638, 609 S.W.2d 670 (1980), rev'd, 272 Ark. 272, 613 S.W.2d 590 (1981).

      <p>
       The court on appeal from a finding of fact made on sufficient competent evidence by the commission has not the legal right to set aside the finding merely because, in its opinion, it is contrary to the weight of the testimony. J.L. Williams & Sons v. Smith, 205 Ark. 604, 170 S.W.2d 82 (1943) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The credibility of witnesses is a matter which lies within the exclusive province of the Workers' Compensation Commission. Kivett v. Redmond Co., 234 Ark. 855, 355 S.W.2d 172 (1962); May v. Crompton-Arkansas Mills, Inc., 253 Ark. 1080, 490 S.W.2d 794 (1973); Morrow v. Mulberry Lumber Co., 5 Ark. App. 260, 635 S.W.2d 283 (1982); Southland Corp. v. Magers, 15 Ark. App. 360, 695 S.W.2d 380 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The weight to be accorded the testimony of the claimant and the inferences to be drawn from it were to be considered by the commission and were not for de novo determination by the courts. Oak Lawn Farms v. Payne, 251 Ark. 674, 474 S.W.2d 408 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not the appellate court's function to weigh the credibility of conflicting witnesses on appeal. Dena Constr. Co. v. Herndon, 264 Ark. 791, 575 S.W.2d 155 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no distinction between medical testimony and other evidence insofar as the resolution of doubts is concerned in Workmen's Compensation proceedings. Clark v. Peabody Testing Serv., 265 Ark. 489, 579 S.W.2d 360 (1979); Public Employee Claims Div. v. Tiner, 37 Ark. App. 23, 822 S.W.2d 400 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions of credibility and the weight to be given the evidence are exclusively within the province of the Workers' Compensation Commission; the reviewing court may not displace the commission's choice between two fairly conflicting views even though, if it were reviewing the matter de novo, the court might have made a different decision. Roberts-McNutt, Inc. v. Williams, 15 Ark. App. 240, 691 S.W.2d 887 (1985), aff'd, 288 Ark. 587, 708 S.W.2d 87 (Ark. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Question of credibility and the weight and sufficiency of the evidence are matters for determination by the commission, which is better equipped, by specialization and experience, to analyze and translate evidence into findings of fact than is the Court of Appeals. Osage Oil Co. v. Rogers, 15 Ark. App. 319, 692 S.W.2d 786 (1985). But see Mid-State Constr. Co. v. Second Injury Fund, 295 Ark. 1, 746 S.W.2d 539 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Weight and sufficiency of evidence are matters for determination by the commission. College Club Dairy v. Carr, 25 Ark. App. 215, 756 S.W.2d 128 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reviewing court may not set aside the commission's decision unless it cannot conscientiously find from a review of the entire record that the evidence supporting the decision is substantial. College Club Dairy v. Carr, 25 Ark. App. 215, 756 S.W.2d 128 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal, the court is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the findings of the commission and give the testimony its strongest probative value in favor of the order of the commission. The issue on appeal is not whether the evidence would have supported a finding contrary to the one made; the question is solely whether the evidence supports the finding made by the commission, and the decision must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. College Club Dairy v. Carr, 25 Ark. App. 215, 756 S.W.2d 128 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence has been defined as more than a mere scintilla, and means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It is of such force and character that it would with reasonable and material certainty and precision compel a conclusion one way or another. College Club Dairy v. Carr, 25 Ark. App. 215, 756 S.W.2d 128 (1988).

       It is well settled that the commission must weigh the credibility of the witnesses, and appellate courts are not at liberty to judge the witnesses' credibility on review. Wade v. Mr. C. Cavenaugh's, 25 Ark. App. 237, 756 S.W.2d 923 (1988), superseded, 298 Ark. 363, 768 S.W.2d 521 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       An appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the findings of the commission, and the standard of review is whether the commission's decision is supported by substantial evidence. Wade v. Mr. C. Cavenaugh's, 25 Ark. App. 237, 756 S.W.2d 923 (1988), superseded, 298 Ark. 363, 768 S.W.2d 521 (1989); Welch's Laundry & Cleaners v. Clark, 38 Ark. App. 223, 832 S.W.2d 283 (1992).
      </p>

       An appellate court will reverse a decision of the commission where convinced that fair-minded persons with the same facts before them could not have arrived at the conclusion reached by the commission. Wade v. Mr. C. Cavenaugh's, 25 Ark. App. 237, 756 S.W.2d 923 (1988), superseded, 298 Ark. 363, 768 S.W.2d 521 (1989).

       Rule 1-2 of the Rules of the Sup. Court and the Court of Appeals cannot possibly deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction of an appeal from the Workmen's Compensation Commission, as the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals from the Workmen's Compensation Commission is not a part of the appellate jurisdiction of that court assigned to it by the Supreme Court pursuant to Const., Amend. 58, but original jurisdiction conferred upon that court by this section. Houston Contracting Co. v. Young, 271 Ark. 455, 609 S.W.2d 895 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court had jurisdiction to address the merits of a workers' compensation case where the court of appeals was merely substituted for the circuit court as the first court to review an administrative order. Magnet Cove Sch. Dist. v. Barnett, 81 Ark. App. 11, 97 S.W.3d 909 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Supreme Court denied the employer's motion to dismiss an estate's wrongful-death and survival action on the ground that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction because the estate did not appeal to the full commission the administrative law judge's jurisdictional statement, based on the parties'
   stipulation, that the “Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission has jurisdiction of this claim”; the administrative law judge's decision became final under this section once it was not appealed.

      <p>
       The doctrine of res judicata applies only to final orders or adjudications, and the filing of a petition for review with the full commission within 30 days prevents the order of the administrative law judge from becoming final. Wilson v. Cargill, Inc., 45 Ark. App. 174, 873 S.W.2d 171 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employer and its insurance carrier appellants did not appeal award within 30 days, the appellate court would not review the challenge to the award of benefits because that decision by the commission was res judicata. Harvest Foods v. Washam, 52 Ark. App. 72, 914 S.W.2d 776 (1996).

       Rule of commission allowing 14 days from effective date of award in which to file a notice of appeal was ineffective as in direct conflict with the provision of former Workers' Compensation law. Commercial Std. Ins. Co. v. Hill, 203 Ark. 768, 158 S.W.2d 676 (1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       The General Assembly has not enacted a law which would authorize the statutory appeal time to be extended, and unless the General Assembly provides such a remedy or procedure, neither administrative law judges nor the commission have the power to waive or otherwise extend the appeal time. Cooper Indus. Prods. v. Meadows, 5 Ark. App. 205, 634 S.W.2d 400 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was evidence that the notice of claim had been mailed to the employer at an address at which he received his mail, and there was evidence from two witnesses that they saw a letter from the Workers' Compensation Commission, with a “green card” attached, on the employer's desk prior to that hearing, it was reasonable to conclude that the order the employer was appealing had been mailed and was received more than 30 days before the notice of appeal and petition were filed; therefore, the appeal was not timely. Martin v. Young, 17 Ark. App. 128, 705 S.W.2d 445 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission erred in reversing the law judge's decision where the law judge's decision had not been timely appealed to the commission. Lloyd v. Potlatch Corp., 19 Ark. App. 335, 721 S.W.2d 670 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional and should be raised by the court even if the parties do not raise it. Lloyd v. Potlatch Corp., 19 Ark. App. 335, 721 S.W.2d 670 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a motion for reconsideration, or rehearing, does not extend the time to file the notice of appeal. Hill v. Travenol Labs., Inc., 24 Ark. App. 116, 748 S.W.2d 356 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission has no authority to entertain a petition for rehearing after the expiration of the 30-day appeal period, and no authority to grant a motion to vacate. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Brewer, 52 Ark. App. 214, 916 S.W.2d 773 (1996).

       Appeal from a decision in a workers'

      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission abused its discretion in dismissing as untimely a worker's pro se notice of appeal from an order of an administrative law judge (ALJ) denying permanent total disability for carpal tunnel injuries because the ALJ's order could not become final until 30 days after the worker received a copy where the worker's attorney was disbarred 26 days after receiving a copy and thus did not have a full 30 days to appeal.

       Commission was correct in refusing to allow claimant to reopen her claim where petition was not filed within the time to appeal and where petition followed an opinion by an administrative law judge that claimant failed to show entitlement to additional benefits since this section applies only to cases where a previous order or award of compensation has been made.

       Rules 13 and 23 of the commission's rules authorize reasonableness on the part of the commission in a variety of circumstances dealing with the prosecution of claims for benefits, in order that the ends of justice may be served; hence, a liberal construction of the commission's rules lends support to the argument that the commission does have authority to entertain a petition for rehearing when based on reasonable grounds.

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant filed a petition for rehearing of the denial of disability benefits on the ground that there was newly discovered evidence, but it appeared that all of the evidence which he claimed was newly discovered was actually within his knowledge before the case was originally submitted to and decided by the commission, the motion for a rehearing was properly denied.

      <p>
       A claimant is not entitled under Arkansas law to obtain additional benefits after a final award without a showing that he has experienced a change in physical condition; a change in economic conditions is not a sufficient ground for reopening an award.

       Where claimant did not argue in his motion to vacate filed with the commission that his physical condition had changed since the order was entered or that there was an assignment of an erroneous wage rate, but argued instead that claimant experienced a change in physical condition prior to the entry of the award but subsequent to the change in workers' compensation carriers, such argument was clearly outside the scope of this section. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Brewer, 52 Ark. App. 214, 916 S.W.2d 773 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the claimant and the employer stipulated to the compensation rates at the November 21, 2013, hearing, the Death and Permanent Total Disability Trust Fund was not yet joined as a party at that time, and therefore the Trust Fund was not bound by that stipulation. Thus, when the Trust Fund provided evidence to the Workers'
   Compensation Commission that the November 2013 rates were not supported by the claimant's wage records, it was not inappropriate for the Commission to modify the claimant's disability-wage rate in accordance with statutory authority.

       Where commission's finding that no causal connection existed between death of employee and his original illness or injury was supported by substantial evidence, the finding was in effect a finding that no permanent disability was occasioned by the first illness and contention on appeal from denial of death benefits that claim for permanent partial disability was based on modification of prior award was not required to be discussed. Chambers v. Bigelow-Liptak Corp., 235 Ark. 1039, 363 S.W.2d 908 (1963).

      <p>
       In a workers'

       Where the question of interstate commerce was heard and determined in a Workman's Compensation claim case, the same question could not be raised again in a claim for death benefits arising out of the same injury. Bell v. Batesville White Lime Co., 217 Ark. 379, 230 S.W.2d 643 (1950) (decision under prior law).

       If an employee dies as a result of the disability for which he has been awarded compensation, the cause of the disability is res judicata. Triebsch v. Athletic Mining & Smelting Co., 225 Ark. 199, 280 S.W.2d 719 (1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctrine of res judicata, forbidding the reopening of matters once judicially determined by competent authority, applies to the decisions of the Workers' Compensation Commission; having once determined that the claimant only suffered 55% permanent disability to the body as a whole, the commission cannot 12 years later say that the claimant was totally disabled at that earlier time. Tuberville v. International Paper Co., 18 Ark. App. 210, 711 S.W.2d 840 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers' Compensation Commission erred when it held that claimant's claim for additional wage-loss disability benefits or permanent and total disability, over and above a March 1997 award of 20 percent wage-loss disability, was barred by res judicata because claimant's more recent claim was based on changes in his condition post-1997, and the Commission erred as a matter of law when it required objective findings to support a change in physical condition relative to his wage-loss claim.

       The question presented to the appellate court reviewing the Commission's decision is not whether the evidence would support findings contrary to those made by the Commission, but whether the evidence supports the findings made by the Commission; even if the Commission's decision is against the preponderance of the evidence, the court will not reverse where its decision is supported by substantial evidence.

       Where an administrative law judge filed an opinion denying claimant additional benefits and the claimant did not file a timely appeal from that order, a subsequent attempt by the administrative law judge to amend his original order and award benefits to the claimant based on a doctor's clarification of the claimant's disability was improper, because the order denying benefits became final when no appeal was sought within 30 days.

      Publisher's Notes.
   
   The Per Curiam Order of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, dated September 1, 1993, provided, in part, that subdivision (b)(1) of this section provides for additional attorney's fees if the claimant prevails on appeal, but this section neither expressly provides for nor expressly prohibits an additional award of attorney's fees in cases where the claimant has been required to defend his award of workers' compensation benefits through two separate appeals brought by the employer to the Supreme Court. Construing the attorney's fee provision liberally and in accordance with the remedial purposes of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-704ol1c3" target="_self">11-9-704(c)(3)</a></cite>, the Supreme Court held that an additional award of attorney's fees is authorized by the statute under such circumstances.

       Where the claimant lost on his appeal from an administrative law judge's decision to the Workers' Compensation Commission, but he won on his cross-appeal, the court regarded the claimant as having prevailed on appeal and therefore he was entitled to an award of attorney fees since this chapter should be interpreted liberally in favor of the claimant. Owens Country Sausage v. Crane, 268 Ark. 732, 594 S.W.2d 872 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature intended § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-716" target="_self">11-9-716</a></cite> and this section to be read in conjunction with one another and saw no conflict between the two statutes; the legislature felt strongly that the commission should be able to award lump-sum attorneys' fees. Had the legislature perceived any conflict between the two sections they would have undoubtedly repealed this section. International Paper Co. v. McBride, 12 Ark. App. 400, 678 S.W.2d 375 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature's use of the word “and” between “controverted” and “awarded” in subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii) means that attorney's fees in workers' compensation cases are contingent upon not only the amount controverted but also the amount awarded. Cleek v. Great S. Metals, 62 Ark. App. 177, 970 S.W.2d 304 (1998), rev'd, Cleek v. Great Southern Metals, 335 Ark. 342, 981 S.W.2d 529 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court overruled the assertion that the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission should have vacated rather than reversed the award of attorney's fees for the claimant, because the Commission's reversing of the award of attorney's fees rather than vacating the award had no bearing on whether the claimant was entitled to attorney's fees on appeal.
   Sierra v. Griffin Gin, 100 Ark. App. 113, 265 S.W.3d 129 (2007), rehearing denied, Sierra v. Griffen Gin, — Ark. App. —, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Ark. App. LEXIS 775 (Nov. 7, 2007), superseded, 374 Ark. 320, 287 S.W.3d 556 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the claimant did not receive any of the additional workers’ compensation benefits awarded because of the offset required by § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-411" target="_self">11-9-411</a></cite> of his disability retirement compensation, this section required the employer to pay the injured worker's one-half portion of the attorney's fees due from the workers’ compensation benefits awarded.
   Ark. Game &amp; Fish Comm'n v. Gerard, 2018 Ark. 97, 541 S.W.3d 422 (2018).
      </p>

       The General Assembly intended the attorney's fees awarded under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-715" target="_self">11-9-715</a></cite> to have priority over the offset provided for in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-411" target="_self">11-9-411</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Plain language of subdivision (a)(2)(B)(i) of this section provides that the attorney's fees awarded will be paid one-half (½) by the employer or carrier in addition to compensation awarded; and one-half (½) by the injured employee or dependents of a deceased employee out of compensation payable to them. The employee’s half comes from the payable amount owed to the employee before any offset.
   Ark. Game & Fish Comm'n v. Gerard, 2018 Ark. 97, 541 S.W.3d 422 (2018).
      </p>

       Attorney's fees in Workers' Compensation cases are provided by statute in Arkansas as a matter of public policy to enable injured workers to obtain the services of an attorney in settlement of controverted claims. Aluminum Co. of America v. Neal, 4 Ark. App. 11, 626 S.W.2d 620 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the purposes of this section is to place the burden of litigation expense on the party which makes litigation necessary by controverting the claim; placing this responsibility on the employer is intended to encourage prompt and honest settlements and to compensate an employee for delay. It is not the purpose of this section to compel an employer to make settlement of a claim for which he has no responsibility and is not liable, or to compensate an employee for delay in collecting funds from the Second Injury Fund for which that employer is likewise not liable. Prier Brass v. Weller, 23 Ark. App. 193, 745 S.W.2d 647 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A maxim of workers' compensation law is that when the commission finds that a case has been controverted, in whole or in part, the commission shall direct the payment of legal fees by the employer or carrier in addition to the compensation awarded.

       This section does not permit the award of attorney's fees against the Second Injury Trust Fund, since such entity is not an employer or carrier within the meaning of this section. Second Injury Fund v. Furman, 62 Ark. App. 194, 972 S.W.2d 255 (1998), aff'd 336 Ark. 10, 983 S.W.2d 923 (1999).

      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney's fees in a workers' compensation case, wherein the employer's insurer denies all liability, should consist of a percentage of the amounts expended for medical services and hospitalization in addition to a percentage of the cash awarded to the client, since the compensation from which the fees are to be derived include medical and hospital services. Ragon v. Great Am. Indem. Co., 224 Ark. 387, 273 S.W.2d 524 (1954).

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidentiary hearing to determine whether maximum attorney fees should be awarded to the claimant's attorney found to be necessary, since such a hearing is necessary only when the record indicates that a bare minimum of services was provided; and the claimant's attorney clearly provided more than a minimum of services. Frank J. Rooney, Inc. v. Pitts, 268 Ark. 911, 597 S.W.2d 120 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The award of attorney's fees is not a penalty but an award of reasonable compensation for services necessarily rendered to compensation claimants based on consideration by the Workers' Compensation Commission of the various factors usually taken into consideration in determining reasonable attorney's fees. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Fatherree, 16 Ark. App. 41, 696 S.W.2d 782 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorneys' fees in a Workers' Compensation case should consist of a percentage of the amounts expended for medical services and hospitalization in addition to a percentage of the cash awarded to the claimant, since the compensation from which the fees are to be derived includes medical and hospital services. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Bussey, 17 Ark. App. 47, 703 S.W.2d 459 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant was totally disabled, but his employment caused only 10% of that disability, attorneys' fees should have been computed upon the basis of the compensation due from the employer, not upon the entire compensation payable for the claimant's total disability. Prier Brass v. Weller, 23 Ark. App. 193, 745 S.W.2d 647 (1988).

       The claimant prevailed in his appeal to the court of appeals, which remanded for reconsideration, and claimant's attorney was allowed the maximum fee under this section. Crow v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 41 Ark. App. 225, 852 S.W.2d 334 (1993).

       Subdivision (b)(1) of this section neither expressly provides for nor expressly prohibits an additional award of attorney's fees in cases where the claimant has been required to defend his award of workers' compensation benefits through two separate appeals brought by the employer; construing the attorney's fees provision liberally and in accordance with the remedial purposes given in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-704ol1c3" target="_self">11-9-704(c)(3)</a></cite>, an additional award of attorney's fees is authorized.

       Where the employer paid all but $35.00 of the claimant's medical expenses, but never recognized liability for her injury, thereby forcing the claimant to try the case fully on the merits in order to be able to seek future medical expenses, she was entitled to recover attorney fees based on the entire amount of her medical expenses, rather than just the $35.00 awarded to her.

       A claim for additional compensation is to be treated as a continuation of the original demand for compensation, and in fixing the attorney's fee, the action of the commission in the parent case is to be considered, while the maximum fee shall be within the fixed limitations of this section and shall not exceed certain percentages of compensation awarded.

       There is no language in the statutes limiting the award of the attorneys' fees to amounts for which the employer and its carrier both controvert and owe; the test is that fees are calculated on the amount controverted and awarded.

       The plea by claimant seeking an additional attorney's fee allowance in connection with an appeal to the Supreme Court must be denied as the statute does not authorize such an allowance, only the commission being empowered to award fees for legal services, further, the maximum fee having been allowed in this case.

      </p>

       Where there was no showing of what services were rendered in behalf of claimant by his attorney on an appeal from the administrative law judge, the attorney should not have been awarded an additional fee relating to the appeal.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant suffered an undisputably compensable injury to his finger, but the payment of compensation benefits was significantly delayed due to delay by employer's physician, the burden of that delay should rest on the employer and since the record contained no evidence that the employer attempted to get the physician to expedite the report, the delay justified award in fees to the claimant's attorney for purposes of the appeal to the Court of Appeals. Ellis v. Clayton Shoe Co., 267 Ark. 882, 595 S.W.2d 229 (Ct. App. 1979).

       Attorney of a workers'

       Evidence sufficient to find that case had not been controverted was justified and claimant was not entitled to controverted attorney's fee. Climer v. Drake's Backhoe, 7 Ark. App. 148, 644 S.W.2d 637 (1983); Walter v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 17 Ark. App. 43, 702 S.W.2d 822 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of whether a claim is controverted is one of fact to be determined from the circumstances of the particular case. Climer v. Drake's Backhoe, 7 Ark. App. 148, 644 S.W.2d 637 (1983); Revere Copper & Brass, Inc. v. Talley, 7 Ark. App. 234, 647 S.W.2d 477 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere failure of an employer to pay compensation benefits does not amount to controversion, in and of itself, especially where the carrier accepts the injury as compensable and is attempting to determine the extent of the disability. Revere Copper & Brass, Inc. v. Talley, 7 Ark. App. 234, 647 S.W.2d 477 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission properly awarded a second maximum statutory attorney's fee which was calculated on some of the same controverted benefits as a prior lump-sum fee, where the same benefits had been controverted and placed in jeopardy twice by the employer and claimant had been required to obtain the services of an attorney on both occasions. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Fatherree, 16 Ark. App. 41, 696 S.W.2d 782 (1985).

       The determination of whether a claim is controverted is a fact question to be resolved from the circumstances of the particular case; the mere failure of the employer to pay benefits does not, in and of itself, amount to controversion, especially when the carrier accepts the injury as compensable and is attempting to determine the extent of the disability.

      </p>
      <p>
       It was not significant for the award of attorneys' fees that medical bills were paid by a collateral source, where they were awarded to the claimant by the Workers' Compensation Commission after being controverted by the employer. The test for the award of attorneys' fees is that fees are calculated on the amount controverted and awarded. General Indus. v. Gibson, 22 Ark. App. 217, 738 S.W.2d 104 (1987).

      <p>
       Neither § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-503" target="_self">11-9-503</a></cite> nor this section makes any provision for assessment of a separate fee based on the amount of the penalty. The attorney's fee allowable should be computed on the amount of compensation controverted and awarded, increased by the safety-violation penalty. Prier Brass v. Weller, 23 Ark.

      </p>
      <p>
       The claimant was entitled to an award of attorney's fees, notwithstanding the conclusion of the Workers' Compensation Commission that the employer, by prevailing on its request for a credit, was justified in not paying the claimant an attorney fee on his ten-percent permanent impairment rating because the credit exceeded its liability for payment of benefits, as the granting of the credit did not diminish the fact that the employer controverted and did not pay permanent disability benefits and that the claimant was, therefore, required to employ counsel. Goodwin v. Phillips Petro. Co., 72 Ark. App. 302, 37 S.W.3d 644 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employer controverts an injured employee's entitlement to certain benefits, but later accepts liability prior to a hearing on the merits, the employee's attorney may still request a hearing for an attorney's fee on those controverted benefits. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Brown, 73 Ark. App. 174, 40 S.W.3d 835 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission did not err in finding that the Second Injury Fund controverted employee's benefits in excess of 25 percent under subdivision (a)(2)(B) of this section; the Fund claimed that the wage loss disability was not ripe and had listed for litigation the extent of employee's disability, and the record indicated that, if employee had not retained an attorney, he would not likely have been receiving any award for wage loss disability. Lee v. Alcoa Extrusion, Inc., 89 Ark. App. 228, 201 S.W.3d 449 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorneys' fees were properly awarded in a workers' compensation case because an employer and its insurer took the position that employee was not entitled to a wage-loss benefit above an impairment rating, which amounted to a controversion of benefits owed. Logan County v. McDonald, 90 Ark. App. 409, 206 S.W.3d 258 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'

       Attorney that had been retained by an employee to represent the employee in a workers' compensation case, but then had been told by the employee that he wanted to end the case, was entitled to assert a lien on a final settlement that was reached after the employee hired a second lawyer instead of abandoning the case; the fact that the attorney had been involved in the case before there was any controversy did not preclude the attorney from imposing a lien for fees.

       Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission properly denied employee's request for attorney's fees under subdivision (a)(4) of this section; in the absence of a contract between employee's medical providers and his attorney, the attorney was not entitled to attorney's fees based upon the value of medical services provided to him.

       Finding in favor of the employee in a workers'

It was undisputed that the rating report from the doctor was dated April 1, 2005, but that the carrier did not issue a check for the employee's permanent-partial-disability benefits until June 8, 2005.

       Where the only compensation awarded to a claimant is weekly benefits, the Workers' Compensation Commission had no statutory authority to direct that an attorney's fee be paid on the basis of a lump-sum award, and since the award and assessment of an attorney's fee against the employer or carrier is purely statutory, the commission erred in awarding a lump-sum fee.

       The Workers' Compensation Commission improperly awarded a claimant's attorney an additional attorney's fee under this section when he filed an action seeking a lump-sum attorney's fee instead of the weekly fee he had been awarded by the administrative law judge, since this section provides for the additional fee only if the claimant prevails on appeal and, considering the nature of the relief sought in this action, it was the claimant's attorney alone who benefitted from the appeal.

       It was the intention of the legislature to enable the Workers' Compensation Commission to approve the lump-sum payment of attorney's fees chargeable to the employer while providing for installment payments of the portion of the attorney's fee chargeable to the injured employee or the injured employee's dependents; in such a situation the portion of the fee to be paid in installments by the injured employee or the injured employee's dependents should not be discounted since it is not being received by the attorney in a lump sum.

       This section and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-715" target="_self">11-9-715</a></cite> were intended to be read together as the legislature felt strongly that the commission should be able to award lump-sum attorneys' fees. International Paper Co. v. McBride, 12 Ark. App. 400, 678 S.W.2d 375 (1984).
      </p>

       Language of the statute is not limited to employers; it does not mention employers or any other respondent by name. The statute includes attorney fees owed by the Arkansas Second Injury Fund.

       Plain language of this section authorizes the Workers'
   Compensation Commission to award lump sum attorneys'
   fees. No limitations are set forth because none were apparently intended.

      <p>
       The General Assembly enacted this section to remedy the problem of attorneys failing to receive full payment for their services to a workers' compensation claimant or beneficiary, where the attorney received his compensation installments on the same schedule that benefits were paid to the recipient but where the claimant or beneficiary died or remarried prior to the attorney's receipt of the total fees awarded to him. Aluminum Co. of America v. Neal, 4 Ark. App. 11, 626 S.W.2d 620 (1982).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The commission was correct in its decision that this section retroactively applied to attorney's fees earned and awarded prior to March 1, 1979; therefore the commission could order that the defendant employer pay the claimant's attorney a lump sum equal to the total value of the weekly payments which were awarded prior to March 1, 1979. Aluminum Co. of America v. Neal, 4 Ark. App. 11, 626 S.W.2d 620 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission erred in holding that a claimant's attorney was not entitled to a lump-sum attorney fee to be paid by the Arkansas Second Injury Fund because the Commission's opinion was based on the false conclusion that the amount of the attorney fee was “unascertainable” because the amount of payments to the claimant were unascertainable; under the statute, the claimant's attorney was entitled to a lump-sum fee.
   Lewis v. Auto Parts & Tire Co., 104 Ark. App. 230, 290 S.W.3d 37 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a lump-sum payment of an employee's one-half portion of the attorney's fee by the Death and Permanent Disability Fund under this section would force the Fund to assume the risk of overpayment, the Arkansas Workers'
   Compensation Commission did not abuse its discretion in denying that request.
   O'Hara v. J. Christy Constr. Co., 2012 Ark. App. 89 (2012).

      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission properly concluded that a lump-sum attorney's fee could not be awarded on a claimant's current total disability award where the award was not ascertainable because it was not permanent; therefore, it was impossible to calculate the award.

       Strictly construing § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-715" target="_self">11-9-715</a></cite> and this section, it is clear that an award of lump-sum attorney's fees is not limited to employers. Therefore, the Workers'
   Compensation Commission had the authority to award a lump-sum attorney's fee payable by a second injury fund under this section, and an appellate court declined to overrule the decision in Lewis v. Auto Parts &amp; Tire Co., Inc., 104 Ark. App. 230, 290 S.W.3d 37 (2008); moreover, further findings of fact were not necessary.

       Where commission found that the responsibility of two carriers should be apportioned on a 75 percent to 25 percent basis in awarding permanent total disability, commission's action in directing one carrier to compensate other carrier for its pro rata share of the total permanent partial disability previously paid was not error since otherwise one carrier would get a free ride at the expense of the other for the permanent partial payments already made to claimant.

       The rights and remedies provided in this chapter for an employee injured in the course of his employment are exclusive of all other rights and remedies; therefore, the circuit court did not err in dismissing a complaint filed by a workers' compensation recipient against the workers' compensation insurer seeking damages for insurer's delay in payment of worker's compensation benefits.

       The benefits payable pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act and the procedure set out in that act for obtaining those benefits constitute an exclusive remedy, and that remedy precludes an action at law, even for an intentional tort arising out of the nonpayment of benefits, where the statutory remedies for late payment include: (1) a twenty percent penalty plus interest for the late payment of an award, (2) a provision by which the Workers' Compensation Commission may require a bond from an employer to insure payment, and (3) a provision that a final award may be filed with the circuit clerk which causes it to become a lien on the property of the employer.

       Twenty-percent penalty and award of a second attorney's fee for controversion was properly assessed against defendants where the commission clearly awarded temporary total disability benefits to the claimant at the rate of $241.93 per week from June 8, 1992, to a date yet to be determined, and defendants were ordered to comply with the award made by the administrative law judge which the commission adopted and affirmed in its April 2, 1993, decision and defendants took no appeal and where defendants had paid none of the temporary total disability benefits that were awarded more than two years prior to the appeal.

       Evidence insufficient to find that claim was controverted. Horseshoe Bend Bldrs. v. Sosa, 259 Ark. 267, 532 S.W.2d 182 (1976); Turner v. Trade Winds Inn, 267 Ark. 861, 592 S.W.2d 454 (Ct. App. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a claim is controverted is a factual question to be determined by the commission from the circumstances of the particular case, and the commission's findings should not be reversed unless it is clear that there has been a gross abuse of discretion. Aluminum Co. of America v. Henning, 260 Ark. 699, 543 S.W.2d 480 (1976).

       Evidence sufficient to find that claim was controverted. Model Laundry & Dry Cleaning v. Simmons, 268 Ark. 770, 596 S.W.2d 337 (Ct. App. 1980); Hart's Exxon Serv. Station v. Prater, 268 Ark. 961, 597 S.W.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1980); Ridgeway Pulpwood v. Baker, 7 Ark. App. 214, 646 S.W.2d 711 (1983); Irons v. Minton, 10 Ark. App. 38, 661 S.W.2d 408 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where at the time of the hearing before the commission the claimant had not selected or elected to pursue a rehabilitation program, there was no error on the part of the commission in limiting its finding as to controversion of benefits to the finding that the employer has controverted payment of permanent partial disability benefits in excess of five percent to the body as a whole. Weeks v. Coca Cola Bottling Co., 270 Ark. 151, 604 S.W.2d 566 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       A determination of whether a claim had been controverted may be a question of fact and is not to be determined mechanically upon ascertaining whether, when the employee has filed his claim, the employer promptly responds by accepting or controverting the claim; there are other factors which the commission may consider in determining whether the services of the attorney were necessitated by the employer's action. Ridgeway Pulpwood v. Baker, 7 Ark. App. 214, 646 S.W.2d 711 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The determination whether a claim was controverted is a question of fact for the commission and the commission's decision on controversion will not be disturbed if it is supported by substantial evidence. Irons v. Minton, 10 Ark. App. 38, 661 S.W.2d 408 (1983).

      <p>
       Where the only compensation awarded to a claimant is weekly benefits, the Workers' Compensation Commission had no statutory authority to direct that an attorney's fee be paid on the basis of a lump sum award, and since the award and assessment of an attorney's fee against the employer or carrier is purely statutory, the commission erred in awarding a lump-sum fee. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Potter, 263 Ark. 689, 567 S.W.2d 104 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers' Compensation Commission properly concluded that a lump sum attorney's fee could not be awarded on a claimant's current total disability award where the award was not ascertainable because it was not permanent; therefore, it was impossible to calculate the award.

       One avowed and worthwhile objective of subsection (a) of this section is to protect the claimant in joint petition settlements; however, there is another objective, also to be valued, and that is the achieving of finality where the parties have reached a fair compromise — hence, the proviso that the commission will have no further jurisdiction.

      <p>
       This section was inapplicable because the company was not seeking a hearing on the merits of an employee's claim or a determination on any of the results of his claimed injuries; the only issue before the Workers'
   Compensation Commission was whether the company was the employee's special employer at the time of his injury and, therefore, immune from suit.
   Pineda v. Manpower Int'l, Inc., 2017 Ark. App. 350, 523 S.W.3d 384 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers'
   Compensation Commission correctly concluded that a joint-petition settlement between an employee and a temporary-employment agency did not deprive it of its jurisdiction to determine whether an employee-employer relationship existed between the employee and a company under the dual-employment doctrine; the company was not a party to the settlement, and the Commission had exclusive, original jurisdiction to determine the employee-employer relationship.

       This section does not authorize a general release discharging an employer from “any and all” liability; rather, it provides only that, upon approval of a joint petition, the commission loses jurisdiction over any claim for the same injury or any results arising from it.

       A chancery court did not have jurisdiction to set aside the commission's order approving a joint petition for final settlement which the claimant alleged was procured from him by the fraudulent representation of the claims adjustor and the examining physician of the insurance carrier that his condition was less serious than it actually was. Johnson v. Lumbermen's Reciprocal Ins. Exch., 249 Ark. 550, 460 S.W.2d 53 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is clear and unambiguous in stating that a joint petition settlement, approved by the Workers' Compensation Commission, eliminates the commission's jurisdiction over any additional claim for the same injury or any results arising from that injury; and that interpretation was correct even though claimant's joint petition specifically stated that she did not waive any rights against the Second Injury Fund and even though such a provision was also included in the administrative law judge's opinion approving the joint petition. Sayre v. State Second Injury Fund, 12 Ark. App. 238, 674 S.W.2d 941 (1984).

       Where employee sustained a compensable injury to his shoulder and filed a claim for benefits which was settled by joint petition, and then filed a separate claim for benefits for a work-related injury to his neck, which injury allegedly occurred on a date prior to the date of the shoulder injury; absent a finding that the two claims arose from a single injury, it was error for the commission to decline jurisdiction over the unsettled neck injury claim pursuant to subsection (b). Wesley v. Monterey Constr. Co., 32 Ark. App. 157, 801 S.W.2d 49 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The circuit court correctly concluded that it was without jurisdiction to settle a dispute over a joint petition approved by an administrative law judge as finality was not achieved because the joint petition did not specify what medical expenses were to be paid and did not set out a specific award relating to those expenses.

      <p>
       Workers' Compensation Commission must conduct a new hearing on a second joint petition for final settlement of a claim after a hearing has been held on a prior joint petition but before an order disposing of the first petition has been entered; approval of the second petition without a second hearing did not deprive the commission of jurisdiction to entertain the claimant's petition requesting a determination of the status of his compensation claim.

      </h4>
      <p>
       An agreement for final settlement approved by the commission without a hearing and evidenced only by letters to the commission from the employer and the claimant's attorney was not a final settlement within the meaning of this section. Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Norsworthy, 244 Ark. 399, 425 S.W.2d 320 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant must have learned no later than the hearing on a joint petition for settlement that if he wanted the payment for injury and other benefits, he could not, under the law, enter into a settlement that left future medical expenses open, the commission's finding that the claimant understood this and agreed to it is fully justified; any doubts which claimant may have harbored concerning the finality of the settlement were amply cured in the face of an inordinate delay before the attempt to reopen the petition, notwithstanding his awareness that payment of medical bills had been refused by his employer. Bradford v. Arkansas State Hosp., 270 Ark. 99, 603 S.W.2d 896 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was variance between terms of joint petition and joint petition order, but proper procedure was followed in promulgating order and claimant was aware that settlement was final, claimant could not reopen claim after long time lapse on basis of claim that order should have included payment of future medical expenses. Bradford v. Arkansas State Hosp., 270 Ark. 99, 603 S.W.2d 896 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the law favors compromise settlements, that general rule does not apply to joint petition settlements of Workers' Compensation claims. Odom v. Tosco Corp., 12 Ark. App. 196, 672 S.W.2d 915 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement for settlement between the parties has no effect on the parties' rights until a hearing is conducted by the commission as required by this section, thus an agreement reached between a claimant and her employer was not effective and could not be enforced where the claimant died before the commission held a hearing on whether to approve the agreement. Odom v. Tosco Corp., 12 Ark. App. 196, 672 S.W.2d 915 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's settlement with his employer and employer's insurance carrier precluded subsequent proceedings against the Second Injury Fund. Ward v. Fayetteville City Hosp., 28 Ark. App. 73, 770 S.W.2d 668 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The finality of a joint petition settlement is viewed from the claimant's standpoint; and it is the claimant's right to proceed further that is extinguished. Stratton v. Death & Permanent Total Disability Trust Fund, 28 Ark. App. 86, 770 S.W.2d 678 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission's approval of a joint petition settlement eliminated its jurisdiction over “any claim for the same injury or any results arising from it,” even where the joint petition contained language attempting to reserve the claimant's right to proceed against the Death and Permanent Total Disability Trust Fund.

       Employers were entitled to take credit for permanent partial disability compensation paid claimant prior to award of compensation to apply on his award for permanent partial disability. Carty v. Ward Furn. Mfg. Co., 229 Ark. 725, 318 S.W.2d 148 (1958).

       Where employee who had developed a debilitating disease had applied for and received weekly payments under a disability insurance policy furnished by employer through its workers' compensation carrier, and where employee later filed for workers' compensation benefits after expiration of his eligibility for the disability payments, employer and its compensation carrier were denied credit for the medical benefits because they were not advance payments of compensation.

       One statute only provides the maximum amount of money an employer must pay as compensation for an employee's work-related death, but the statute is silent on whether a credit for good-faith, but ultimately mistaken, payments may be given; because the widow was not her husband's dependent, the money the employer paid her could not be counted as weekly benefits or compensation, and the payments did not accrue as a credit against the employer's responsibility to the Fund.

     <p>
      The Seventy-Ninth General Assembly realizes that the Arkansas workers' compensation statutes must be revised and amended from time to time. Unfortunately, many of the changes made by this act were necessary because administrative law judges, the Workers' Compensation Commission, and the Arkansas courts have continually broadened the scope and eroded the purpose of the workers' compensation statutes of this state. The Seventy-Ninth General Assembly intends to restate that the major and controlling purpose of workers' compensation is to pay timely temporary and permanent disability benefits to all legitimately injured workers that suffer an injury or disease arising out of and in the course of their employment, to pay reasonable and necessary medical expenses resulting therefrom, and then to return the worker to the work force. When, and if, the workers' compensation statutes of this state need to be changed, the General Assembly acknowledges its responsibility to do so. It is the specific intent of the Seventy-Ninth General Assembly to repeal, annul, and hold for naught all prior opinions or decisions of any administrative law judge, the Workers' Compensation Commission, or courts of this state contrary to or in conflict with any provision in this act. In the future, if such things as the statute of limitations, the standard of review by the Workers' Compensation Commission or courts, the extent to which any physical condition, injury, or disease should be excluded from or added to coverage by the law, or the scope of the workers' compensation statutes need to be liberalized, broadened, or narrowed, those things shall be addressed by the General Assembly and should not be done by administrative law judges, the Workers' Compensation Commission, or the courts.

       Construing the provisions of the Workers'
   Compensation Act strictly, the Workers'
   Compensation Commission abused its discretion in dismissing as untimely a worker's pro se notice of appeal from an order of an administrative law judge (ALJ) denying permanent total disability for carpal tunnel injuries because the ALJ's order could not become final under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c09s11-9-711ol1a1" target="_self">11-9-711(a)(1)</a></cite> until 30 days after the worker received a copy where the worker's attorney was disbarred 26 days after receiving a copy and thus did not have a full 30 days to appeal.

      <p>
       The strict construction mandate of Acts 1993, No. 796 and the requirement that the appellate court view the evidence in a light most favorable to the Workers' Compensation Commission's decision and uphold that decision if it is supported by substantial basis for denying relief do not change the requirement that the Workers' Compensation Commission must have, in fact, a substantial basis for denying a claim for benefits; the substantial evidence test is not satisfied by evidence which merely creates a suspicion.

       The legislative intent as expressed in this section contains nothing to support the view that prior case law in regard to dependency benefits was repealed. Lawhon Farm Servs. v. Brown, 60 Ark. App. 64, 958 S.W.2d 538 (1997), aff'd, 335 Ark. 272, 984 S.W.2d 1 (1998).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Because this section discourages judicial lawmaking and because the Court of Appeals must defer to decisions of the Supreme Court, the appeals court could not broaden the scope of workers' compensation law so that the Second Injury Fund would become liable for wage-loss disability benefits payable to a disabled worker in the event of successive injuries during the same employment. Maxey v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 341 Ark. 306, 18 S.W.3d 328 (2000).

     </h3>
     <p>
      As a guide to the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of this state is declared to be as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c10s11-10-102ol11">
       Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state. Involuntary unemployment is a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the General Assembly to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which may fall with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his or her family. The achievement of social security requires protection against this great hazard of our economic life.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c10s11-10-102ol12">
       This can be accomplished by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment from which benefits may be paid for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of poor relief assistance.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c10s11-10-102ol13">
       The General Assembly, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, under the police power of the state, for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.

      <p>
       This chapter is founded upon the employer-employee relationship, absent which it does not apply; there is nothing in it to indicate a legislative intent to destroy the independent contractor concept of existing law or to subject to its terms any other relation than that of master and servant or employer and employee. Crossett Lumber Co. v. McCain, 205 Ark. 631, 170 S.W.2d 64 (1943), superseded by statute as stated in, Morris v. Everett, 647 S.W.2d 476 (1983) (decision under prior law).

       Employees held not to be independent contractors and company hiring them held to be their “employer.” McKinley v. R.L. Payne & Son Lumber Co., 200 Ark. 1114, 143 S.W.2d 38 (1940) (decision under prior law); Morris v. Everett, 647 S.W.2d 476 (1983).

       Company hiring contractors held not to be “employer” of contractors' employees. Southern Kraft Corp. v. McCain, 205 Ark. 943, 171 S.W.2d 947 (1943).

       Although the federal statute defines an employer as one who has four or more individuals in his employment, the state of Arkansas had the right and power to make the chapter apply to the employer of only one individual. Bland v. Belle Point Lodge, 235 Ark. 331, 359 S.W.2d 804 (1962).

       An employee can possibly be unemployed during vacation, and the fact he is paid vacation pay is not in itself conclusive as to his ineligibility for unemployment benefits. If during a layoff period an employee's prescribed vacation period arrives he would be entitled to receive that which he has already earned (vacation pay) without rendering him ineligible for unemployment compensation for the layoff period then in progress; however, claimants are not entitled to unemployment benefits during a period of paid vacation simply because the vacation period was preceded by a layoff period.

       Worker who was physically disabled beyond a base period, and had not received wages for work performed for almost two years when he filed his unemployment compensation claim did not meet the eligibility requirements pursuant to this section.

      <p>
       A claimant who voluntarily leaves part-time employment is ineligible for further unemployment benefits only to the extent that his benefits would have been decreased by his part-time wages. Hopkins v. Stiles, 10 Ark. App. 77, 662 S.W.2d 177 (1983), rev'd, 282 Ark. 207, 666 S.W.2d 703 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it appeared from the record that, had claimant continued her part-time employment, her part-time wages were too small to have any effect on unemployment benefits which she was already receiving, claimant was entitled to unemployment benefits even though she voluntarily left part-time job without good cause. Hopkins v. Stiles, 10 Ark. App. 77, 662 S.W.2d 177 (1983), rev'd, 282 Ark. 207, 666 S.W.2d 703 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant should not have been disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits as a result of her accepting part-time employment, when no suitable full-time employment was available. Coit v. Stiles, 12 Ark. App. 397, 678 S.W.2d 373 (1984), aff'd, 285 Ark. 212, 686 S.W.2d 405 (Ark. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant failed to report part-time income on his unemployment compensation claim form, the Board of Review was justified in finding that the failure to report constituted a willful, false statement of a material fact, making the claimant liable for repayment of overpaid benefits under §§ <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c10s11-10-520" target="_self">11-10-520</a></cite> — <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c10s11-10-532" target="_self">11-10-532</a></cite>; the failure to report was material, even though the amount of part-time income received by the claimant amounted to less than 40% of his weekly benefit. Coy v. Stiles, 13 Ark. App. 98, 679 S.W.2d 804 (1984).

         As used in this section, the term “seasonal industry” means an industry in which, because of the seasonal nature thereof, it is customary to lay off forty percent (40%) or more of the average monthly number of workers for at least four (4) consecutive months during a regularly recurring period of each year and in which industry it is highly impracticable or impossible to continue seasonal operations throughout a period or periods of one (1) year in length. However, the total cessation of operations is not a prerequisite to classification as a seasonal industry.

         After a study of previous employment records, and after investigation and hearing, the Director of the Division of Workforce Services shall determine the normal seasonal period or periods during which workers are ordinarily employed for the purpose of carrying on seasonal operations in each seasonal industry. Until the determination by the director, no industry shall be deemed to be seasonal. The director may initiate a study of an industry upon his or her own motion or upon a request filed with the director by any employing unit or person that would be affected by any determination made as a result of such a study. If a study is made, it shall be mandatory for the director to make his or her determination and report thereon within ninety (90) days after written application for the determination has been filed. If the director initiates the study of an industry upon his or her own motion and finds that the industry meets the seasonal requirements set forth in this section, he or she shall make his or her determination and report within ninety (90) days after the study is initiated. In either event, the industry shall be classified as a seasonal industry effective on the January 1 immediately following the date of the director's determination. Provided that, any employer who is classified as a seasonal employer under these provisions may make a written request to the director asking not to be treated as a seasonal employer. If the request is approved, treatment as a seasonal employer will cease effective January 1 of the following calendar year.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Company resisting efforts of claimants to obtain unemployment benefits has burden to go forward to overcome the prima facie case made by the determination of the examiner that claimants were available for work. Little Rock Furn. Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner of Labor, 227 Ark. 288, 298 S.W.2d 56 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere fact that applicants for unemployment payments were available for picket duty did not of itself show that they were unavailable for employment. Monsanto Chem. Co. v. Thornbrough, 229 Ark. 362, 314 S.W.2d 493 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where applicant for unemployment benefits refused to accept offered employment contending the rules of the labor union to which he belongs would subject him to a fine and possible discharge from the union for accepting a job paying less than the union scale, he was not protected from disqualification for unemployment benefits as he was not required to resign from the labor organization. Thornbrough v. Stewart, 232 Ark. 53, 334 S.W.2d 699 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       An unemployed person, partially disabled by an industrial injury, whose physician has released her for light-duty work, may still be able to compete in the labor market and may qualify for unemployment benefits as one available for work, although she may be receiving, under the Workers' Compensation Law, partial permanent disability benefits as distinguished from temporary total disability benefits during the period of recuperation. Ross v. Daniels, 266 Ark. 1056, 599 S.W.2d 390 (Ct. App. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence sufficient to find that claimant was not available for work. Loftin v. Daniels, 268 Ark. 611, 594 S.W.2d 578 (Ct. App. 1980); Hodnett v. Daniels, 271 Ark. 479, 609 S.W.2d 122 (1980); Lanoy v. Daniels, 271 Ark. 922, 611 S.W.2d 524 (1981); Duvall v. Daniels, 1 Ark. App. 50, 613 S.W.2d 116 (1981); Price v. Director of Labor, 4 Ark. App. 341, 631 S.W.2d 22 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no exception to the availability or search for work requirement on the basis of “good cause” for personal reasons. Hodnett v. Daniels, 271 Ark. 479, 609 S.W.2d 122 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The availability requirement cannot be read out of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c10s11-10-214ol1a" target="_self">11-10-214(a)</a></cite> to allow pro-rata benefits to the worker under a liberal interpretation of the statute. Lanoy v. Daniels, 271 Ark. 922, 611 S.W.2d 524 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence sufficient to find that claimant was available for work. Washington v. Everett, 6 Ark. App. 28, 639 S.W.2d 57 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimants have no more than a hope of future employment with employer, they are available for work as required by this section. Sanyo Mfg. Corp. v. Stiles, 17 Ark. App. 20, 702 S.W.2d 421 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Board of Review erred by determining that appellant was not eligible for unemployment benefits because he did not have transportation or a driver's license; as long as there existed employment that did not require appellant to have a driver's license, he was available to work. Buchanan v. Dir. of Ark. Empl. Sec. Dep't, 91 Ark. App. 35, 207 S.W.3d 567 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of unemployment benefits to the employee was appropriate pursuant to subdivision (3)(A) of this section because her own statements and testimony undermined her present contentions that she was currently available for work. In part, the employee testified that she was not looking for work because she was devoting all of her time to school and that it would be difficult to work and go to school; she also testified that she was only available to work a couple of hours a day.
   Hayden v. Director, Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2010 Ark. App. 298 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if claimant may have been hesitant to ask for rides, the Board of Review failed to find that he was unwilling to use the option if he found available work; thus, claimant had offered an alternative form of transportation to and from work and the board's denial of unemployment benefits was reversed.
   Debnam v. Dir., Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2015 Ark. App. 537, 471 S.W.3d 657 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Review did not err in finding that the employee was ineligible for benefits due to not being available for work given his testimony that he was not available to work due to a death in the family, childcare, and other dependent-care arrangements.
   Fowlkes v. Dir., Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2017 Ark. App. 56, 512 S.W.3d 667 (2017).

       Where plaintiff was declared ineligibile to receive benefits and thereafter did not report and register at the Employment Security Division office, trial courts' finding that plaintiff's appeal from the commissioner's rulings of ineligibility made it unnecessary for plaintiff to thereafter report and register weekly was error since the making of a weekly claim for benefits is a prerequisite to the right of an insured worker to claim benefits.

       Substantial evidence supported a Social Security administrative law judge's finding, that an Arkansas disability claimant was able to work during the period of time that she was laid off and collected unemployment benefits, because pursuant to this section, only individuals who were physically and mentally able to perform work were eligible to collect unemployment benefits.

       The legislature did not intend that the scope of the phrase state vocational school be interpreted to include any vocational school within the state attended for the purpose of upgrading or improving the worker's job skills; the phrase was intended to include only state-sponsored, tax-supported, vocational schools. Thus, where an unemployment benefits claimant attended nursing assistant school at a private hospital, she was not attending a state vocational school, and was not fully available for work.

      <p>
       The duty and obligation of an unemployed individual, who has made application for benefits, to accept available and suitable work may exist regardless of whether the work is temporary employment or full-time employment; moreover, suitability of work does not require that the job offered must be equal in every respect to the prior working conditions, that the pay be equal to or better than the previous wage scale. Wacaster v. Daniels, 270 Ark. 190, 603 S.W.2d 907 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where only employment offered claimant involved a 50 percent salary reduction, it was not suitable employment under the circumstances. Price v. Everett, 2 Ark. App. 98, 616 S.W.2d 766 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Review's determination that the claimant was disqualified from benefits because she failed without good cause to accept suitable work when offered was remanded because the Board did not set forth a factual basis for concluding that the claimant's training was without the approval of the director.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The purpose of the Employment Security Law is to relieve some of the economic consequences of involuntary unemployment, and not to penalize or reward either the employee or employer engaged in a legitimate labor dispute; thus the law's only concern with labor disputes is for the determination, when a claim is filed for benefits, whether claimant's unemployment is voluntary or involuntary. City of Fort Smith v. Moore, 269 Ark. 617, 599 S.W.2d 750 (1980).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Employees temporarily laid off because of lack of work when a strike goes into effect who are then notified by their employer to return to work, but refuse to do so because they are members of the striking union and refuse to cross the picket lines, lost their employment because of a labor dispute in which they were involved and were not entitled to unemployment benefits during the strike. Fort Smith Chair Co. v. Laney, 238 Ark. 636, 383 S.W.2d 666 (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employees who were laid off and drawing compensation when their union went on strike were entitled to continue drawing compensation benefits until such time as the employer notified them to return to work and they refused to do so. Harding Glass Co. v. Crutcher, 244 Ark. 618, 426 S.W.2d 403 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employees had been told that a boiler had blown up and that they would be notified to return to work as soon as it was repaired, but employees' union thereafter called a strike in which employees actively participated by picketing the plant, the employees were properly denied unemployment compensation. Tosh v. A.T.I., Inc., 259 Ark. 228, 534 S.W.2d 242 (1976).

       Where employees initially left their jobs by reason of a labor dispute and employer closed the plant, employees were not entitled to benefits as there was a possibility of future negotiations, since section specifies that there is still a labor dispute regardless of cessation of operations.

       Since the term labor dispute used in this section is not specifically defined in Arkansas by statute or court decision all of the facts and circumstances in each case must be considered in determining whether a labor dispute exists or has terminated within the meaning of this section.

       Evidence sufficient to find that claimants were eligible for benefits because they were no longer unemployed by reason of a labor dispute. Randall, Burkart/Randall Div. of Textron, Inc. v. Daniels, 266 Ark. 1060, 599 S.W.2d 392 (1979), aff'd, 268 Ark. 375, 597 S.W.2d 71 (Ark. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       When employees cease all strike activity and apply unconditionally for reinstatement and the employer has resumed normal operations, the labor dispute is regarded as terminated and claimants may not be disqualified under this section. City of Fort Smith v. Moore, 269 Ark. 617, 599 S.W.2d 750 (1980); Arlington Hotel v. Everett, 5 Ark. App. 92, 633 S.W.2d 46 (1982).

       As used in this section, the term “lockout” is defined as the cessation of furnishing of work to employees or withholding work from them in effort to get more desirable terms for employer. Jacks v. Stiles, 19 Ark. App. 129, 717 S.W.2d 828 (1986).
      </p>

       Arkansas Board of Review erred in finding that an employee was eligible for unemployment compensation benefits because the employee was hired by a private employer to perform services “for” an educational institution, a school district, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section; the employee testified that she performed the same services for the same school as an employee of that school before the school began outsourcing the hiring of its substitute teachers to the employer, and she also testified that the services she performed as a substitute teacher were not any different after the employer took over.

       Sections 11-10-512 — 11-10-519 are mutually exclusive. Little Rock Furn. Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner of Labor, 227 Ark. 288, 298 S.W.2d 56 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unemployment benefits are not for those individuals who are voluntarily unemployed or incapable of working due to illness or family responsibilities which preclude them from accepting employment within their capabilities. Wacaster v. Daniels, 270 Ark. 190, 603 S.W.2d 907 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employees' acceptance of a severance package precluded unemployment benefits, the appellate court held that, because employees acted in reliance of the explicit prior policy of the employer, which allowed for unemployment benefits when their severance pay ran out, it was unfair and inequitable for the employees to be denied unemployment benefits when the employer later changed that policy and then denied benefits because the employees had not applied for unemployment benefits before the effective date of the policy change. Thompson v. Dir., Empl. Sec. Dep't, 88 Ark. App. 181, 196 S.W.3d 521 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conditioning the availability of unemployment benefits upon a person's willingness to violate “cardinal principles” of their religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of constitutional liberties. Guaranteed Auto Fin., Inc. v. Dir., ESD, 92 Ark. App. 295, 213 S.W.3d 39 (2005).

       The Board of Review's denial of unemployment benefits pursuant to this section, based upon a finding that the claimant voluntarily left his last work without good cause connected with the work, was supported by substantial evidence, where the record contained three conflicting statements made by the claimant himself and a fourth version of the facts made by the manager of the grocery store where he was employed.

       Where petitioner worked as a quality control chemist for a plastics manufacturer and, without medical advice, quit to avoid certain chemicals in order to protect the integrity of her breast milk after having a child and voluntarily choosing to breast-feed the child, there was substantial evidence to support the board of review's finding that petitioner voluntarily left work without good cause.

       Where employee quit his job because the employer's president questioned him about an insurance claim he submitted for substance abuse treatment and employee felt that this was an invasion of his privacy and that he could not continue working under those conditions, the employee left his work voluntarily and without good cause connected with the work.

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of benefits improper where the Board of Review's decision did not set forth sufficient findings of fact upon which it relied in reaching its conclusion; the decision presented a conclusory statement, labeled a “finding,” the Board did not detail or analyze the facts upon which this “finding” was based, and the Board failed to provide a simple straightforward statement of what happened.

       Arkansas Board of Review's finding that the claimant voluntary left work without good cause was not supported by substantial evidence; whether there was good cause was irrelevant where the departure was not voluntary, but rather, the job was completed.

       Arkansas Board of Review's decision granting unemployment benefits to an employee based on a finding that he left his employment after his employer requested volunteers for a work force reduction was not supported by substantial evidence; the Board never explicitly made a finding as to whether the employer “asked for volunteers” pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.

      <p>
       Substantial evidence did not support the conclusion by the Arkansas Board of Review that the claimant made reasonable efforts to preserve his job rights, because while the Board suggested that requesting a leave of absence would have been impractical and would have constituted a futile effort to preserve his job rights, there was simply no evidence in the record regarding what the employer's response to such a request might have been.

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the award of unemployment benefits, because the employee was discharged, and due to the inclement weather, the Arkansas Board of Review found that the employee had good reason for refusing to report to work and that her refusal under the circumstances did not constitute a willful disregard of the employer's interests; it had been snowing on the day in question, police advised travelers to exercise caution on bridges, and the employee had to travel over at least one bridge to get to work.

       General economic conditions which lead to a claimant's seeking higher wages or lower living costs do not constitute “good cause connected with the work,” as contemplated in this section. Broyles v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 712, 600 S.W.2d 426 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although benefits would be denied an employee who left her work for general economic reasons not connected with some specific alleged unfairness perpetrated by her employer, an act by the employer which does economic injury to the employee may be good cause connected with the work.

       There is nothing in the chapter which even remotely suggests that an employee may voluntarily quit her job because of an isolated incident which might arguably be in violation of a section of this chapter and thereby preserve unemployment insurance benefits.

      </p>
      <p>
       While allegations of substantial decrease in wages may be considered as good cause for voluntary departure from employment, complaints based primarily upon economic conditions beyond the control of the employer do not fit the statutory exemption from disqualification. Armstrong v. Daniels, 270 Ark. 303, 603 S.W.2d 481 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “good cause” means a justifiable reason for not accepting the particular job offered and to constitute good cause, the reason for refusal must not be arbitrary or capricious and the reasons must be connected with the work itself; while personal factors may be considered in determining whether there is good cause, they are not controlling or dispositive of the issue. Wacaster v. Daniels, 270 Ark. 190, 603 S.W.2d 907 (1980); Rowlett v. Director, 45 Ark. App. 99, 872 S.W.2d 83 (1994).

       Sexual harassment endured by an unemployment benefits claimant does not have to be unbearable before the treatment could be considered good cause for the claimant to voluntarily quit her job. McEwen v. Everett, 6 Ark. App. 32, 637 S.W.2d 617 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good cause to refuse work which is otherwise suitable, as required to remain eligible for unemployment compensation under this section, does not exist merely because the employee's acceptance of the offered position will result in the discharge of a fellow employee of less seniority.

      <p>
       In determining the existence of good cause for voluntarily leaving one's work under this section, factors to be considered include the degree of risk to one's health, safety, and morals, and her physical fitness, prior training, and experience.

      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's decision not to commute to new place of employment did not constitute failure to accept suitable work where the commute was 50 additional miles, the travel expenses, although partially reimbursed, would result in a net decrease in pay, and where the inherent conditions of the mountainous road presented a safety hazard. Carpenter v. Director of Ark. Emp. Sec. Dep't, 55 Ark. App. 39, 929 S.W.2d 177 (1996).

       The claimant did not have good cause to leave his work voluntarily where: (1) the day before he resigned, the claimant took off work to go deer hunting and did not call in to inform his supervisor; (2) the next day, he reported to work and was confronted by his supervisor regarding his absence; (3) the supervisor presented him with a written reprimand, and the claimant refused to sign it; (4) the claimant objected to the reprimand and maintained that there was a disparate application of the absenteeism policy; (5) thereafter, the supervisor retrieved the reprimand document and gave the claimant a choice between taking a demotion with a pay cut or resigning; and (6) the claimant chose to resign and seek benefits.

       Employee was entitled to unemployment benefits where it was determined that he left his job for good cause; the employee had spent five years of complaining to all levels of management about his reassignment and quit after having management violate its own seniority rules and take no action to provide a permanent remedy such that his circumstances would reasonably impel an average worker to give up his or her employment.

       Arkansas Board of Review properly held that employee was entitled to unemployment benefits under under subdivision (a)(1) of this section where the employee had good cause to leave once his constitutionally protected religious beliefs diverged with his job requirement of working on Saturdays as an automobile salesman; the employee could not be denied unemployment compensation solely because he chose his religion over his job.

       Court disagreed with the Arkansas Board of Review's conclusion that an employee failed to prove that she left her job for reasons that would have impelled the average able-bodied, qualified worker to give up her employment and that, in the absence of such good cause, she was disqualified from receiving benefits pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of this section. In the court's view, reasonable minds could not have concluded, on the basis of the facts actually found by the board, that the employee lacked good cause connected with the work for terminating her employment unless she continued to endure abuse, later including abuse for whistle blowing, after she had made two fruitless efforts to rectify her problem with management.

       Employee's claim for unemployment benefits was wrongfully denied under subdivision (a)(1) of this section because the employee voluntarily left work with good cause; the employee was sexually harassed by a coworker, who was relative of the employer.

      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Review erred in denying unemployment benefits, because reasonable minds could not conclude, on the basis of the facts actually found by the Board, that an employee lacked good cause connected with the work for terminating his employment when the employee was not being compensated; the employee did not allege a substantial decrease, but rather no compensation at all, and the Board made a specific finding that the employee showed he continued to work for several weeks without pay.
   Ballard v. Director, 2012 Ark. App. 371 (2012).

      <p>
       Board of Review erred under subdivision (a)(1) of this section in denying a claimant unemployment benefits based on a finding that she quit her previous employment as a dental assistant voluntarily and without good cause because the employer admitted that he continued making inappropriate sexual remarks regarding the claimant in front of patients.

       Board of Review’s finding that the employee voluntarily quit her employment without good cause connected to the work was not supported by substantial evidence, as the employee presented evidence that she experienced verbal lashings from the employer and physical threats by a resident while working as community manager and the employer acknowledged that a resident threatened the employee’s physical safety but the employer took no remedial action the court could see.

      </p>
      <p>
       Unemployment benefits were denied because an employer’s decision to not extend the practice of helping the claimant with travel expenses with a bonus did not create good cause for the applicant to quit. Also, there was no good cause to quit based on a reassignment to a different position; there was no evidence that the applicant complained about a loss of pay or that the new position was more dangerous.

       Inasmuch as this chapter contains no definition of leave of absence, the court would consider language of the contract between the parties, prior conduct and dealings by the employer with employees, and any other relevant facts at hand in determining if a leave of absence existed.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where contract of employment provided for leaves of absence for good cause and for reasonable periods and employee was granted leave of absence of one year for pregnancy although document stated that there probably would be no place for employee when she returned, but record reflected that employees granted the leave were nearly always hired back without loss of seniority benefits, the employee was granted a leave of absence within the meaning of this chapter.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where employee was granted year's pregnancy leave but applied for reinstatement and was refused prior to expiration of the year, commissioner erred in declaring employee eligible for unemployment benefits since leave of absence had not expired and one year leave of absence was not an unreasonable time.

       A claimant who voluntarily leaves part-time employment is ineligible for further unemployment benefits only to the extent that his benefits would have been decreased by his part-time wages. Hopkins v. Stiles, 10 Ark. App. 77, 662 S.W.2d 177 (1983), rev'd, 282 Ark. 207, 666 S.W.2d 703 (1984).

      <p>
       Where it appeared from the record that had claimant continued her part-time employment, her part-time wages were too small to have any effect on unemployment benefits which she was already receiving, claimant was entitled to unemployment benefits even though she voluntarily left part-time job without good cause. Hopkins v. Stiles, 10 Ark. App. 77, 662 S.W.2d 177 (1983), rev'd, 282 Ark. 207, 666 S.W.2d 703 (1984).

       An employee who was laid off from a full-time job after ten years, subsequently obtained a part-time job with an employment agency, and later quit the part-time job was entitled to unemployment benefits based upon the full-time job subject only to partial reduction by the amount of her part-time wages.

       This section does not require an individual to offer medical proof of a personal emergency to his employer; it requires the individual to make reasonable efforts to preserve his job rights.

       Board of Review erred in denying an employee's claim for unemployment benefits based on voluntary unemployment because the employee quit her employment due to a family situation, she asked the employer about a change of duties prior to quitting, but none were available, the employee's personal emergency did not disappear when her ex-husband moved out of state and was no longer being available for childcare, and she was unable to afford alternate childcare.

      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's failure to seek a leave of absence from her employer because he did not grant leaves did not disqualify her under this section as not having made reasonable efforts to preserve her job rights, since asking for a leave of absence after her employer had released her would be a useless act and since a claimant who is terminated by her employer through no fault of her own is not bound to preserve her job rights as is required when she voluntarily quits her employment.

       Under subdivision (a)(1) of this section, appellant was not entitled to unemployment benefits as she left her last employment without making reasonable efforts to preserve her job rights because she did not provide her employer with her release to return to work, and because she did specifically ask, and only assumed, she had been fired.

      </p>
      <p>
       While it is understandable and logical why an employee who quits a permanent job in order to accept a temporary one is dissentitled to benefits when the temporary employment ceases, the same disqualifying rule would not be applicable when an employee leaves a temporary assignment to accept another temporary position which affords more pay. Kilgore v. Falls Church Animal Hosp., 267 Ark. 801, 590 S.W.2d 671 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the decision of the Board of Review that a temporary employee voluntarily quit her employment and was disqualified from unemployment benefits, because she was offered work assignments after her last job ended and she declined each assignment without good cause.

       There is no authority that would allow an employee's pre-employment statements regarding the terms of her temporary employment to qualify as a prospective resignation that the employer could then accelerate at any time, and acceleration of an employee's separation from work, which does not flow from the employee's voluntary resignation, is simply called termination. Without substantial evidence to support the finding that the temporary employee voluntarily left her last work without good cause, the judgment was reversed for an award of benefits.

       Where it was undisputed that only non-railroad wages from claimant's base period were used to determine the basis for his claim, jurisdiction was properly exercised by the Arkansas Board of Review; because there was insufficient evidence to show that claimant's actions either caused, or were the most likely cause of, the alteration of the urine sample, claimant was discharged from work for reasons which did not constitute misconduct and was, thus, eligible for unemployment compensation.

       It must be remembered in interpreting and applying this section that the basic design of this chapter is to protect the employee from the economic consequences of unemployment through no fault of the employee; and, to that end, this chapter should be liberally construed.

       In keeping with the declaration of the state public policy of providing benefits to workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own, the statutory misconduct provision of the law must be given an interpretation in keeping with that declared policy and it should not be so literally construed as to affect a forfeiture of benefits by an employee except in clear instances of misconduct. Willis Johnson Co. v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 795, 601 S.W.2d 890 (Ct. App. 1980); St. Vincent Infirmary v. Arkansas Employment Sec. Div., 271 Ark. 654, 609 S.W.2d 675 (1980).

       While various definitions of the term have been given by Arkansas courts, it appears generally accepted that a finding of “misconduct” will attach only to conduct evincing an intentional or deliberate violation of employer rules, a willful or wanton disregard, or carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest wrongful intent or evil design. Hillman v. Arkansas Hwy. & Transp. Dep't, 39 F.3d 197 (8th Cir. 1994).

       While there may be some overlap in the definitions of the respective terms, a greater element of subjective culpability appears to be required for a finding of “misconduct” than that needed to find “just cause” under the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, <cite class="us_code">38 U.S.C. § 4301</cite> et seq.; while misconduct would always constitute just cause, the converse is not necessarily true.

       After employee received unemployment benefits based on a finding of no work-related misconduct, collateral estoppel did not bar the employer from asserting, in a racial discrimination case, that the employee was fired for inappropriate behavior; an administrative finding that the employee was discharged for reasons that did not disqualify him for unemployment benefits under subdivision (a)(1) of this section did not address the issue of whether an improper racial motive was present within the meaning of § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c123s16-123-107ol1a1" target="_blank">16-123-107(a)(1)</a></cite> and, absent evidence of racial animus, summary judgment for the employer was proper.

       Because the requested change in the employee's duties from maintenance man to cook, despite his unsanitary condition and lack of training, was not reasonable, and, under subdivision (a)(1) of this section, the employee's refusal to cook did not constitute misconduct sufficient to deny unemployment compensation.

       Denial of unemployment benefits based on misconduct was supported by substantial evidence, because the testimony from the employer's director of asset protection was sufficient evidence of misconduct, as he was well aware of the ethics investigation findings, and an ethics investigation team received evidence of the employee's misconduct from three sources; neither the appeal tribunal nor the review board was bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence.

       Employee who went out of town to visit her family when no schedule had been posted yet for the coming week did not commit employment misconduct when she called two days later to inform her employer that she would not be able to report to work; therefore, the denial of her claim for unemployment benefits was in error.

       Board of Review erred in denying an employee's application for unemployment benefits because the facts were not sufficient to support a finding of misconduct where the employee's asking another employee about his bonus amounted to a good-faith error in judgment or an isolated instance of ordinary negligence and did not establish wrongful intent or evil design, and while such conduct might be a sufficient basis for the discharge, it was not a sufficient basis for the denial of unemployment compensation.

       Board of Review did not err in denying the claimant unemployment benefits because she was discharged from last work for misconduct in connection with the work as her absences were in disregard of the employer's interests and thus amounted to misconduct in connection with the work because she accumulated twenty-six and a half points for absences - sixteen and a half points more than was normally allowed under the employer's attendance policy; and she missed three consecutive days, just prior to her termination, with no call in or explanation.

       Because the employer had reserved sole and absolute discretion to determine the appropriate disciplinary action in each case, and the claimant incurred three separate infractions of work rules in a short period of time, the Board of Review's finding that the claimant was discharged from her last work for misconduct was supported by substantial evidence.

       Board of Review did not err in denying unemployment benefits to the claimant based on misconduct because there was substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that the points accumulated by the claimant for violating the employer's work rules were correctly calculated and uniformly applied; claimant had received a group warning about taking more time than was authorized for meals or break periods before receiving the second written warning and being discharged on the third violation.

       Worker's testimony clearly conflicted with the statements of his employer, and the Board of Review resolved these conflicts in favor of the employer and there was substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that the worker was discharged from his last work for misconduct connected with the work due to his absenteeism.

       Substantial evidence supported a determination that the claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits because of her misconduct in connection with her work where the claimant was discharged for excessive absenteeism and, although the claimant contended that many of her absences were due to work related carpal tunnel syndrome, she produced only one note from her doctor that plainly excused her from work.

       Arkansas Board of Review erred in denying an employee's claim for unemployment compensation benefits; employee's absenteeism did not constitute misconduct sufficient to disqualify her from benefits pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of this section as the absences were mostly due to sickness and were therefore beyond the employee's control. Oliver v. Dir., Empl. Sec. Dep't, 80 Ark. App. 275, 94 S.W.3d 362 (2002).

      <p>
       Court reversed a decision of the Board of Review denying appellant unemployment benefits because substantial evidence did not support the Board's finding that appellant's absences constituted a willful disregard of the employer's best interests. The employer allowed its employees to accumulate up to nine points without the risk of losing their jobs, and appellant was discharged when a vacation day was “inadvertently” counted against him, resulting in an accumulation of nine points in a year. The evidence showed that appellant's actual absentee/tardiness points fell within the range allowed by the employer.

      <p>
       Board of Review erred in denying an employee's claim for unemployment benefits under subsection (a) of this section because she did not engage in misconduct where, although she did not provide a doctor's excuse for her 4-day absence, her illness was beyond her control, she told a ranking supervisor that she was leaving due to illness, and kept her employer informed about the basic course of her illness.

      <p>
       Board of Review's decision that the employee violated this section was unreasonable where there was no evidence that the employee intentionally violated the rules so as to manifest wrongful intent or evil design by being absent for three days, as there was no evidence that the employee was told by her treating physician that she had been released to return to work.

       Regardless of the worker's argument that her absences were due to illness and were not intentional, she was discharged for violating her employer's attendance policy, and there was substantial evidence to support the decision that she was discharged for misconduct connected with work; the employee handbook provided that excessive absenteeism was unacceptable and that absences without approval might subject an employee to disciplinary action, plus the worker was verbally warned several times, and she was issued a written warning.

      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Review properly affirmed the denial of an employee's claim for unemployment benefits because the employee, who had worked for the employer for over 35 years, was aware of the employer's absence policy, the employee had received prior disciplinary warnings for attendance, the employee's intent was irrelevant where she was discharged for absenteeism based on the terms of a bona fide written attendance policy, regardless of whether the policy was a fault or no-fault policy, as required by statute, and the employee did not make a request to Human Resources to use vacation leave or for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act.

      <p>
       Board of Review erred in affirming and adopting the Appeal Tribunal's denial of an employee's application for unemployment benefits because the employee's single incident of purported misconduct did not rise to the level of willful disregard of her employer's interest and did not indicate the requisite intent; the employee had been arrested at midnight the previous night and was incarcerated, and she testified that there was no way to call her employer ahead of time to let them know that she would be absent where she was allowed only one phone call, which she used to call her mother in order to make arrangements to get out of jail and check on her children.

       Board of Review's decision that a teacher's aide was discharged for violating the school district's attendance policy was reversed; although the district had a written policy on absenteeism, the policy provided for loss of pay, not discharge for excessive absenteeism. There was neither a showing that the aide's discharge was pursuant to a bona fide written attendance policy under subdivision (a)(2) of this section nor a finding that her conduct was willful under subdivision (a)(3).

       There was not substantial evidence that an unemployment claimant's actions after he injured his back constituted misconduct because he did not consider his back-pain situation to involve a leave of absence, he contacted his immediate supervisor and informed the supervisor of the situation in accordance with the personnel policy, and he never heard back from anyone until his spouse subsequently informed him that he had been replaced.

       Arkansas Board of Review's decision, which denied a claim for unemployment benefits pursuant to its finding that claimant was discharged for misconduct, was supported by substantial evidence where (1) claimant's termination and the Board's denial of benefits were not based on a misrepresentation in the bank's record book or failure to follow proper procedures, but rather on claimant's untruthfulness during an investigation, (2) claimant represented to a bank investigator that two employees participated in opening the depository when in fact the claimant acted alone in contravention of the bank's policy, (3) there was no doubt that this representation was not truthful, regardless of claimant's testimony that failure to follow proper procedure in this manner was commonplace, and (4) while claimant characterized the conduct as a mere lack of judgment, reasonable minds could have concluded that it rose to the level of dishonesty and an intentional disregard of claimant's obligations as well as the employer's interest.

       Although the employer stated that employee was discharged for failure to follow the recommendations of the employee assistance program, no misconduct was shown where employee, after being asked by the counselor to take a drug test, sought advice from his union; while employee's reliance on the union's advice to go home rather than take the test may have been ill-advised, this conduct was not sufficient for reasonable minds to conclude that employee's conduct rose to the level of “misconduct.” Carraro v.

       Whether the claimant did both or either of the two acts of misconduct charged need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; instead, the employer is only required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that one of the charges of misconduct occurred in order to support its position that the claimant was discharged for misconduct in connection with his work.

       Board of Review properly affirmed the Appeal Tribunal's denial of a professor's request for unemployment benefits based on its finding that she was discharged for misconduct in connection with her work because, inter alia, she had received multiple reprimands, was the subject of multiple student complaints, acted unprofessionally by using class time to ask students to write letters to support her, failed to show up for class, failed to keep office hours, impermissibly changed the format of her course from on-campus to online, performed inadequately in an observed class, and repeatedly failed to either come to work or provide necessary documentation as to her medical situation that prevented her from working.

       Board of Review erred in denying unemployment benefits to an employee because the evidence did not support the Board's finding of misconduct where the employer's statement indicated that he discharged the employee for the rude and offensive manner in which she argued with him in a telephone conversation and there was no evidence of an intentional or deliberate violation, a willful or wanton disregard, or carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest wrongful intent or evil design.

       Board of Review erred in finding that an employee was disqualified from collecting unemployment benefits because his negligent action in damaging a truck owned by the employer did not rise to such a level as to constitute misconduct, but was instead the result of ordinary negligence or a good-faith error in judgment. While the employer might have acted reasonably in deciding to terminate the employee, there was no substantial evidence to support the Board's determination that the employee's action amounted to an intentional disregard of his employer's interest or manifested wrongful intent or evil design.

       Board of Review erred in denying an employee's claim for unemployment benefits based on misconduct in connection with the work because the employee's conduct was not of such a degree or recurrence as to manifest culpability, wrongful intent, evil design, or an intentional or substantial disregard of her employer's interests or her duties and obligations; the evidence showed that the employee notified the employer that she could not work due to her illness and hospitalization, she remained hospitalized for over two months, was placed on a ventilator, and underwent a tracheotomy, the employer sent the employee the notification letters during her hospitalization, and the employee contacted the employer shortly after she had been discharged.

       Where a temporary employee voluntarily quit her employment and was disqualified from unemployment benefits, the Board of Review incorrectly assessed the unemployment disqualification for violations of subdivision (a)(1)(B) of this section as enacted in July 2011 rather than the statute in effect on the refusal dates.

       The term “condition” in subdivision (d)(3) of this section, providing that a recipient of unemployment compensation was not required to accept a job which, as a “condition” of employment, required the recipient to resign from a bona fide labor organization, did not mean as a “result” of accepting employment; rather, the term meant as a “requirement” of employment and referred to restrictions contained in the offer of employment made by the employer.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The purpose of this chapter is to relieve some of the economic consequences of involuntary unemployment, and not to penalize or reward either the employee or employer engaged in a legitimate labor dispute; thus the law's only concern with labor disputes is for the determination, when a claim is filed for benefits, whether claimant's unemployment is voluntary or involuntary. City of Fort Smith v. Moore, 269 Ark. 617, 599 S.W.2d 750 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       When employees cease all strike activity and apply unconditionally for reinstatement and the employer has resumed normal operations, the labor dispute is regarded as terminated and claimants may not be disqualified under the labor dispute provision.

      <p>
       A private agreement between an employee and an employer cannot affect the eligibility of the employee for unemployment benefits. To hold that by private agreement one who refuses reasonable employment is entitled to unemployment benefits would make his eligibility dependent upon negotiations between the employer and the employee or his bargaining agent rather than on the statute.

      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Review's determination that the claimant was disqualified from benefits because she failed without good cause to accept suitable work when offered was remanded because the Board did not set forth a factual basis for concluding that the claimant's training was without the approval of the director.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The duty and obligation of an unemployed individual, who has made application for benefits, to accept available and suitable work may exist regardless of whether the work is temporary employment or full-time employment; moreover, suitability of work does not require that the job offered must be equal in every respect to the prior working conditions, that the pay be equal to or better than the previous wage scale. Wacaster v. Daniels, 270 Ark. 190, 603 S.W.2d 907 (1980); Roberson v. Director of Labor, 28 Ark. App. 337, 775 S.W.2d 82 (1989).

       Evidence sufficient to find that benefits should have been granted since work offered claimant was not suitable. Oxford v. Daniels, 268 Ark. 991, 597 S.W.2d 844 (Ct. App. 1980); Price v. Everett, 2 Ark. App. 98, 616 S.W.2d 766 (1981); Oxford v. Daniels, 2 Ark. App. 200, 618 S.W.2d 171 (1981).

      <p>
       Where following their employer's reduction in work force, several employees were, in accordance with the seniority provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, offered alternative positions with the employer at lower-skilled positions and at a lower rate of pay, the board of review should have considered the suitability of the alternative work offered in determining whether the employees were offered suitable work which they refused, thus disqualifying them from benefits, despite the claimants' contention that they had good cause to reject the alternative positions because their acceptance of the positions would have resulted in the discharge of fellow employees of less seniority. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Couch, 8 Ark. App. 37, 648 S.W.2d 497 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “good cause” means a justifiable reason for not accepting a particular job; and the question of what constitutes “good cause” is a question of fact for the board. Roberson v. Director of Labor, 28 Ark. App. 337, 775 S.W.2d 82 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's decision not to commute to new place of employment did not constitute failure to accept suitable work where the commute was 50 additional miles, the travel expenses, although partially reimbursed, would result in a net decrease in pay, and where the inherent conditions of the mountainous road presented a safety hazard. Carpenter v. Director of Ark. Emp. Sec. Dep't, 55 Ark. App. 39, 929 S.W.2d 177 (1996).

       Where applicant for unemployment benefits refused to accept offered employment, contending rules of the labor union to which he belonged would subject him to a fine and possible discharge from the union for accepting a job paying less than the union scale, this did not protect him from disqualification for unemployment benefits since he was not required to resign from the labor organization. Thornbrough v. Stewart, 232 Ark. 53, 334 S.W.2d 699 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Loss of union privileges, whether by union rules or by provisions in a collective bargaining agreement, did not provide good cause, under subdivision (d)(3) of this section, for rejecting a job and did not render offered employment unsuitable for unemployment compensation purposes.

       It must be remembered in interpreting and applying this section that the basic design of this chapter is to protect the employee from the economic consequences of unemployment through no fault of the employee; and, to that end, this chapter should be liberally construed.

        Evidence.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Evidence sufficient to find that claimant was disqualified from receiving benefits because he made a false statement of material fact when filing claim. Eden v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 690, 600 S.W.2d 416 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Board of Review found that the worker was aware that he had not been laid off due to a lack of work and that he misrepresented the circumstances of his separation when filing his initial claim for benefits, there was substantial evidence to support the finding that he was disqualified.
   Holmes v. Dir., Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2015 Ark. App. 337, 463 S.W.3d 744 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Review's decision disqualifying a former employee from receiving unemployment benefits was supported by substantial evidence where a wage audit revealed that she had earned $9.60 during one week in the claim period, she reported no earnings for that week, she was aware that she worked for a short period of time that week and was given information about reporting those wages, and there was no evidence that she was unaware of the requirement to report her earnings.
   Rivera v. Dir., Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2018 Ark. App. 436, 560 S.W.3d 797 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unemployment compensation claimant's disqualification was reversed as substantial evidence did not support the finding that his failure to report earnings information was willful; the employer reported earnings of $38.78 for two weeks that were itemized as “top of scale pay” and that were taken up by deductions and taxes such that claimant received nothing. He did not go to work, he did not receive a paycheck, and he did not get money directly deposited into a bank account, and he could not be found to have willfully failed to disclose material facts before he knew those facts himself.
   Klak v. Dir., Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2020 Ark. App. 117,
   597 S.W.3d 86 (2020).

      <p>
       Both monetary and nonmonetary determinations must be made in the first instance in order to avoid piecemeal litigation of claims. Davis v. Stiles, 287 Ark. 261, 700 S.W.2d 369 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although subdivisions (a)(1) and (2) divide the monetary and nonmonetary determinations into separate findings, they do not require bifurcated proceedings on each issue. Davis v. Stiles, 287 Ark. 261, 700 S.W.2d 369 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the monetary and nonmonetary determinations are separate findings under this section does not lead to the conclusion that the Employment Security Division can secure a finding of monetary ineligibility, stop the proceedings at that point while the claimant appeals, and then upon a reversal challenge eligibility of the claimant on other grounds, forcing a second appeal by the claimant; the claimant's appeal should be able to encompass all challenges the first time. Davis v. Stiles, 287 Ark. 261, 700 S.W.2d 369 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The nonmonetary determination must at least be unmistakably reserved in the original determination, but this does not allow the Employment Security Division to make a practice of routinely stating for the record that the determination is reserved until the monetary eligibility is settled on appeal; such a reservation must be in good faith and for an unavoidable reason which can be demonstrated at the time of the reservation. Davis v. Stiles, 287 Ark. 261, 700 S.W.2d 369 (1985).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Employer who was notified by employment office that former employee had been denied benefits, since she had voluntarily quit employment, was entitled to notice from employment office when it decided to pay benefits to employee as result of redetermination. Call v. Luten, 219 Ark. 640, 244 S.W.2d 130 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employer is entitled to notice of commissioner's determination that period of disqualification of employee has passed so that employee may resort to administrative remedies regardless as to whether employer has a meritorious defense. Cash v. Rocket Mfg. Co., 223 Ark. 561, 267 S.W.2d 318 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a nonresident unemployment compensation claimant did not receive notice of her benefits hearing until after the date scheduled for her hearing, the claimant was not given a reasonable opportunity to present her testimony or evidence, and since it appeared from the record that this was not due to any fault on claimant's part, due process required that the proceeding be remanded for a hearing. Roberts v. Everett, 8 Ark. App. 49, 648 S.W.2d 504 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unemployment benefits board of review fulfilled its legal obligation of providing notice to a claimant's correct address, and as all other correspondence and notifications sent by the board had successfully reached that address, the claimant's assertion that he never received a notice advising him that an award of benefits had been reversed failed.
   Worden v. Director, Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2013 Ark. App. 579 (2013).

      <p>
       Where the evidence showed that claimant was without fault in being overpaid in unemployment benefits and that he was financially troubled, claimant was not required to repay the money and the disputed amount could not be deducted from future benefits. Giles v. Director of Labor, 2 Ark. App. 301, 621 S.W.2d 10 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to the evidence, the agency was estopped to recover overpayment to claimant. Wells v. Everett, 5 Ark. App. 303, 635 S.W.2d 294 (1982).

       Considering both the adjudicative nature of the functions performed by the defendant hearings appeals referee in his position with the Arkansas Employment Security Department as well as the safeguards against unconstitutional or otherwise improper conduct that are built into the structure of the division's adjudicatory system, the defendant referee is absolutely immune from liability for damages based on actions taken in connection with his duties.

       Subsection (c) does not apply to appellate review before the Board of Review; at that stage, there is no statutory provision for reopening a decision, but only a provision for judicial review. Arkansas Emp. Sec. Dep't v. Mellon, 322 Ark. 715, 910 S.W.2d 699 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) gives the Appeal Tribunal the authority to reopen a case only if the party that filed the appeal fails to appear at the initial tribunal hearing and subsequently shows good cause as to why the party did not appear; because claimant for unemployment benefits was not the party who filed an appeal, the Appeal Tribunal had no authority to entertain her request to reopen the case; further, the record failed to show that claimant ever petitioned the Appeal Tribunal, but rather, she appealed the denial of benefits to the Arkansas Board of Review. Williams v. Director, 79 Ark. App. 407, 88 S.W.3d 427 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) provides that the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal may reopen a decision upon a showing of good cause, however, that procedure does not apply to the next tier of appellate review before the Arkansas Board of Review; at that stage, there is no statutory provision for reopening a decision, only a provision for judicial review.

      <p>
       There is no requirement that a claimant make a personal appearance at hearing to have his reasons for contesting a decision denying benefits made part of the record and considered by the appeals tribunal. Stewart v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 809, 601 S.W.2d 245 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of review did not err in finding that the employer was not entitled to have the case reopened because subdivision (d)(1) of this section clearly stated that a party could request a reopening if it failed to appear at initial tribunal hearing, and, the employer did not fail to appear at the initial tribunal hearing; rather, the employer appeared but then declined to participate.
   S. Ark. Developmental Ctr. for Children And Families v. Dep't of Workforce Servs., 99 Ark. App. 260, 258 S.W.3d 803 (2007).

       Although the Board of Review and Appeals Tribunal may consider a claimant's initial statement to the local employment security agency as some evidence either in support of the claim or in opposition to it, such a statement alone cannot serve as substantial evidence in support of the claim.

       Board of Review's determination that an unemployment compensation claimant failed to show good cause for not participating in a hearing under subdivision (d)(1)-(2) of this section was reversed; the claimant's attorney attempted to participate in the telephonic hearing but was prevented from doing so by technical difficulties not of her making.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Under this section, the appeals tribunal and the Board of Review were required to consider whether unemployment compensation claimant's receipt of notice of denial more than the permitted time limit after it was mailed was such a circumstance beyond his control as to permit a late appeal. Battle v. Daniels, 260 Ark. 683, 543 S.W.2d 477 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a claimant was given no opportunity before the Board of Review to attempt to explain the lateness of her appeal to that body, and where there was no substantial evidence in the record to support the finding of the board that the failure to file a timely appeal was not a result of circumstances beyond her control, due process required that claimant be afforded a hearing on her contentions. Paulino v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 676, 599 S.W.2d 760 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's argument that her appeal was untimely because of concentrated effort to secure employment was not an acceptable defense. Nichols v. Stiles, 11 Ark. App. 212, 668 S.W.2d 554 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's reliance upon her attorney did not excuse her failure to file a timely appeal because the client is bound by the acts of his attorney within the scope of the latter's authority, including the attorney's negligent failure to file proper pleadings. Springdale Mem. Hosp. v. Director of Labor, 34 Ark. App. 266, 809 S.W.2d 828 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board of Review erred in determining that an appeal by the employer from a decision in favor of an unemployment compensation claimant was timely where the appeal was postmarked 89 days after the date the decision was mailed and the only evidence presented was that the employer's representative prepared the notice of appeal in a timely manner; the envelope containing the notice of appeal was at all times in the control of the employer, but timely delivery to the post office was not proven, and, therefore, the decision of the board could not be sustained. Bennett v. Director of Emp. Sec. Dep't, 73 Ark. App. 281, 42 S.W.3d 588 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Board of Review erred in dismissing an employee's appeal of an order denying a claim for unemployment benefits because the decision denying the claim was not mailed to the address that the employee provided to the hearing officer; hence, the 20-day period in which to file a timely appeal had not begun to run, and the appeal was not untimely filed under subdivision (a)(1) of this section.
   Sigel v. Director, Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2012 Ark. App. 213 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board found that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that appellant had visited her local office, and although she testified that she had, her credibility was a matter for the board and not the court; furthermore, her testimony never indicated that she visited the office prior to the appeal deadline, and the Board did not err in finding that she did not prove her late appeal was due to circumstances beyond her control.
   Term v. Williams, 2015 Ark. App. 144, 457 S.W.3d 291 (2015).

       Where an employer was not present at Board of Review hearing where the claimant presented his case and the previous denial of benefits was overturned, and the employer contended that its absence was due to lack of notice, the matter was remanded to determine whether the employer had received notice. Helena-West Helena Sch. Dist. v. Stiles, 15 Ark. App. 30, 688 S.W.2d 326 (1985).

        Evidence.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Evidence sufficient to support the Board of Review's finding that employees' unemployment was because of a labor dispute in which they participated as active union members. Tosh v. A.T.I., Inc., 259 Ark. 228, 534 S.W.2d 242 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Board of Review and appeals tribunal may consider a claimant's initial statement to the local employment security agency as some evidence either in support of the claim or in opposition to it, such a statement alone cannot serve as substantial evidence in support of the claim. J.P. Price Lumber Co. v. Daniels, 270 Ark. 297, 604 S.W.2d 579 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subdivision (a)(2), the board has discretion to direct that additional evidence be taken, but it is not required to do so as long as each side has notice and opportunity to rebut the evidence of the other party. Rogers v. Director of Labor, 27 Ark. App. 128, 767 S.W.2d 319 (1989); Arkansas Game & Fish Comm'n v. Director of Labor, 36 Ark. App. 243, 821 S.W.2d 69 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding that the employee was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits was appropriate and because it appeared from the record that both parties had a fair opportunity to present their evidence at the hearing, there was no abuse of discretion in denial of the employee's request to take additional evidence.
   Ramirez v. Director, 2013 Ark. App. 453 (2013).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t11c10s1110525CaseNotesEvidence.PreviouslySubmitted.">
       <b>
        —Previously Submitted.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Previously submitted means evidence submitted in some previous hearing at which either party would have an opportunity to question or support it. Jordan v. Dukes, 269 Ark. 581, 600 S.W.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where Board of Review reversed referee's decision denying benefits on the basis of a statement of claimant's coemployee which had not been presented to the referee and which was sent to the board without its solicitation and without notice to the employer, there was a failure to comply with this section which does not permit the board to consider evidence of which a party has not been apprised. Jordan v. Dukes, 269 Ark. 581, 600 S.W.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was improper for the Board of Review to accept and consider a letter submitted unilaterally by the employer's safety coordinator, without notice to the claimant employee, furnishing information not presented at the appeal tribunal hearing, since the consideration violates the procedures set forth in this section and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c10s11-10-526" target="_self">11-10-526</a></cite>. Brewer v. Everett, 3 Ark. App. 59, 621 S.W.2d 883 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board of Review is without jurisdiction to accept additional evidence in appeals pending before it; accordingly where, in reversing an award of benefits on grounds of misconduct, the board in its findings referred to statements submitted by the employer for the first time on appeal, it must be assumed that the board based its decision upon the new evidence and the decision must be reversed. Ramsey v. Everett, 7 Ark. App. 120, 644 S.W.2d 621 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the Board of Review considered evidence that was not before the appeal tribunal, and the additional evidence likely was prejudicial to the claimant, the board's decision reversing the appeal tribunal and denying unemployment compensation to the claimant had to be remanded. Jones v. Director of Labor, 8 Ark. App. 234, 650 S.W.2d 601 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it is within the discretion of the Board of Review to direct that additional evidence be taken, nothing in the law requires a second hearing so long as each side has notice of and a fair opportunity to rebut the evidence of the other party. Maybelline Co. v. Stiles, 10 Ark. App. 169, 661 S.W.2d 462 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board of Review did not err in refusing to accept any evidence other than that which was previously submitted before the appeal tribunal. Fry v. Director of Labor, 16 Ark. App. 204, 698 S.W.2d 816 (1985).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Inferences, drawn by the Board of Review to the effect that claimant was indeed interested in a job and benefited from it, were permissible under the evidence and claimant was obligated to make that information known when he drew his unemployment insurance; accordingly, the board's finding that claimant was disqualified from receiving benefits because he made a false statement of material fact when filing claim was sustained. Eden v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 690, 600 S.W.2d 416 (Ct. App. 1980).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where Court of Appeals' order of remand directed the Board of Review to consider certain additional evidence, the Board of Review was correct in holding that at the time of the remand hearing it could make findings only for that evidence. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Couch, 12 Ark. App. 267, 675 S.W.2d 838 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant failed to report part-time income on his unemployment compensation claim form, the Board of Review was justified in finding that such failure to report constituted a willful, false statement of a material fact, making the claimant liable for repayment of overpaid benefits under this section; such failure to report was “material,” even though the amount of part-time income received by the claimant amounted to less than 40% of his weekly benefit, the amount of income allowed under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c10s11-10-503" target="_self">11-10-503</a></cite> before benefits will be reduced.

       There is no requirement to enter an appearance at a Board of Review hearing or lose by default. Parker v. Ramada Inn, 264 Ark. 472, 572 S.W.2d 409 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement that a claimant make a personal appearance at hearing to have his reasons for contesting a decision denying benefits made part of the record and considered by the appeals tribunal. Stewart v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 809, 601 S.W.2d 245 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board of Review's decision in favor of the employee could not be sustained in view of the fact that the employee declined to appear or otherwise present evidence to the appeals tribunal or Board of Review, and the employer presented substantial evidence in support of its position. J.P. Price Lumber Co. v. Daniels, 270 Ark. 297, 604 S.W.2d 579 (1980).

       Where entire record of hearing before chief appeals referee was before the appeal tribunal on remand, company resisting efforts of claimants to obtain unemployment benefits had the burden to go forward to overcome the prima facie case made by the determination of the examiner. Little Rock Furn. Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner of Labor, 227 Ark. 288, 298 S.W.2d 56 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employee has prevailed upon his claim at the agency level the burden is upon the employer to go forward with evidence before the appeals tribunal to overcome the prima facie case in favor of the employee created by the agency determination. J.P. Price Lumber Co. v. Daniels, 270 Ark. 297, 604 S.W.2d 579 (1980).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where an unemployment benefits claimant, who was discharged for alleged dishonesty, had no opportunity to subpoena and cross-examine adverse witnesses either at the hearing before the appeals tribunal or at the proceeding before the Board of Review, he was denied due process of law. Smith v. Everett, 276 Ark. 430, 637 S.W.2d 537 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the Board of Review's denial of unemployment benefits was based solely on the employer's belated affidavit that the claimant voluntarily quit his job without making reasonable efforts to preserve his job rights, the board's decision had to be reversed and remanded since the claimant was not given an opportunity to confront and cross-examine the employer or other adverse witnesses whose names may have surfaced as the result of the employer's affidavit. Smith v. Everett, 6 Ark. App. 337, 642 S.W.2d 320 (1982). But see Fry v. Director of Labor, 16 Ark. App. 204, 698 S.W.2d 816 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the notice for an unemployment compensation hearing had stated that the claimant was discharged for alleged misconduct in connection with the work, the claimant introduced evidence to refute that charge, and the appeal tribunal based its qualification decision on the ground that the claimant was guilty of misconduct, the Board of Review denied the claimant his due process rights when, on a further appeal, it injected for the first time the issue that the claimant had voluntarily quit, because the board thereby denied the claimant proper notice of the disputed issue, the opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and the chance to present rebuttal evidence on the voluntary quit issue. Linscott v. Director of Labor, 9 Ark. App. 103, 653 S.W.2d 150 (1983).

       Evidence sufficient to support the action of the Board of Review in affirming an overpayment determination. Lemay v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 683, 599 S.W.2d 771 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence sufficient to affirm an award by the Board of Review. Willis Johnson Co. v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 795, 601 S.W.2d 890 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was improper for the Board of Review to accept and consider a letter submitted unilaterally by the employer's safety coordinator, without notice to the claimant employee, furnishing information not presented at the appeal tribunal hearing, since such consideration violates the procedures set forth in § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c10s11-10-525" target="_self">11-10-525</a></cite> and this section. Brewer v. Everett, 3 Ark. App. 59, 621 S.W.2d 883 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is prejudicial error for the Board of Review to consider matters submitted to it by one party which were not in evidence before the referee and of which the other party is afforded no notice or opportunity of rebuttal. Clay v. Everett, 4 Ark. App. 122, 628 S.W.2d 339 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is within Board of Review's discretion to direct that additional evidence be taken. Carp Constr. v. Stiles, 23 Ark. App. 24, 740 S.W.2d 632 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hearsay evidence can constitute substantial evidence in unemployment compensation cases, but the claimant must be given the opportunity to subpoena and cross-examine adverse witnesses at some stage of the proceedings. When the claimant does not request another hearing in order to cross-examine witnesses whose hearsay statements have been received in evidence, he effectively waives his right of cross-examination, and due process requirements are not violated. Edwards v. Stiles, 23 Ark. App. 96, 743 S.W.2d 12 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Arkansas Board of Review erred by determining that claimant was disqualified from unemployment benefits as she voluntarily left her job without good cause connected with the work, because the Board made no findings with respect to her claim of gender discrimination. Upon remand, the Board was directed to consider whether claimant had a reasonable opportunity to present evidence of four letters from other female employees who claimed to have endured discrimination under subdivision (a)(1) of this section .
   McAlister v. Williams, 2012 Ark. App. 349 (2012).

      <p>
       Although the appeals referee asked a great number of very leading questions, and in some instances came close to putting words in the mouth of the claimant while she was testifying and the Board of Review adopted the findings and decision of the referee as its own, the actions did not require a reversal since neither the referee nor the Board of Review were bound by the statutory rules of evidence or by the technical rules of procedure. Stagecoach Motel v. Krause, 267 Ark. 1093, 593 S.W.2d 495 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The parties before the Board of Review are not required to formally object or proffer evidence to preserve a record for appeal purposes, since such a requirement would impose a duty contrary to that envisioned by the General Assembly when it enacted this section. Smith v. Everett, 6 Ark. App. 337, 642 S.W.2d 320 (1982). But see Fry v. Director of Labor, 16 Ark. App. 204, 698 S.W.2d 816 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the appeal tribunal nor the Board of Review is bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence. Haynes v. Director of Labor, 19 Ark. App. 71, 719 S.W.2d 437 (1986).

       Where claimant was denied employment security benefits under this section and appealed to the appeal tribunal, it was error for the referee to refuse to contact her employer to confirm that she was terminated while in the hospital, since the proper procedure would have been to continue the hearing and subpoena the witness. Ireland v. Daniels, 2 Ark. App. 44, 616 S.W.2d 33 (1981).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The Court of Appeals does not consider additional evidence filed except as ordered by the court and directed to the Board of Review. Jones v. Director, Ark. Emp. Sec. Dep't, 61 Ark. App. 155, 965 S.W.2d 789 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court could not grant claimant the relief sought because her argument depended upon facts not in evidence that were presented for the first time in her petition for judicial review; pursuant to subdivision (c)(2)(A), the appellate court was precluded from receiving additional evidence on appeal, nor could it remand for the Arkansas Board of Review to reopen its decision, even on a showing of good cause. Allen v. Dir., Empl. Sec. Dep't., 84 Ark. App. 239, 139 S.W.3d 138 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an owner of a company used an expletive when calling a former employee a liar after she denied methamphetamine use, the employee voluntarily quit with good cause under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c10s11-10-513" target="_self">11-10-513</a></cite> when she left the premises a few minutes later; thus, substantial evidence supported a finding that she was entitled to unemployment benefits.
   Pocahontas Elecs. v. Dir., Dep't of Workforce Servs., 96 Ark. App. 227, 240 S.W.3d 130 (2006).

        Findings of Facts.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The findings of fact made by the Board of Review are conclusive upon judicial review if supported by substantial evidence. Reddick v. Scott, 217 Ark. 38, 228 S.W.2d 1008 (1950); Terry Dairy Prods. Co. v. Cash, 224 Ark. 576, 275 S.W.2d 12 (1955); Shipley Baking Co. v. Stiles, 17 Ark. App. 72, 703 S.W.2d 465 (1986); Edwards v. Stiles, 23 Ark. App. 96, 743 S.W.2d 12 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the findings of the Board of Review are supported by substantial evidence is a question of law, and the Court of Appeals may reverse a finding of the Board of Review which is not supported by substantial evidence. St. Vincent Infirmary v. Arkansas Employment Sec. Div., 271 Ark. 654, 609 S.W.2d 675 (1980); Edwards v. Stiles, 23 Ark. App. 96, 743 S.W.2d 12 (1988); Cowan v. Director, Ark. Emp. Sec. Dep't, 56 Ark. App. 17, 936 S.W.2d 766 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The findings of the Board of Review are conclusive on appeal if they are supported by the evidence. The definition of evidence in this context means substantial evidence, and whether the evidence is substantial is a question of law. Murphy v. Everett, 5 Ark. App. 281, 635 S.W.2d 301 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal, the findings of fact of the board of review are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence; substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Perdrix-Wang v. Director, Emp. Sec. Dep't, 42 Ark. App. 218, 856 S.W.2d 636 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       On review of unemployment compensation cases, the factual findings of the Board of Review are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence. Brown v. Director, Emp. Sec. Div., 54 Ark. App. 205, 924 S.W.2d 492 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the finding that the claimant's acts were against her employer's best interests and that she was discharged for misconduct in connection with the work, because the claimant failed to follow routing procedures, and failed to review and edit a document before it was submitted to the director.
   Weinstein v. Dir., 2013 Ark. App. 374, 428 S.W.3d 560 (2013).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Discharge in violation of a labor contract was not an issue in a court review and the court's judgment denying unemployment benefits was not res judicata of that issue. Andrews v. Victor Metal Prods. Corp., 237 Ark. 540, 374 S.W.2d 816 (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the issues of failure of the claimant to register for employment or his availability for employment were neither raised nor adjudicated prior to appeal to the circuit court from denial of benefits, the issues could not be raised on an appeal from the circuit court's reversal of the denial of benefits. Stover v. Deere, 249 Ark. 334, 461 S.W.2d 393 (1970).
      </p>

      <p>
       The director of labor must file a certified copy of the record of the case, including all documents, papers, and a transcript of the testimony, within a reasonable period of time; and a period of 90 days after the filing of the notice of appeal is a reasonable time within which to file the record on appeal. Wortham v. Director of Labor, 31 Ark. App. 175, 790 S.W.2d 909 (1990).

      <p>
       When administrative board fails to make finding upon pertinent issue of fact case will be remanded. Reddick v. Scott, 217 Ark. 38, 228 S.W.2d 1008 (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where testimony indicated that a claimant was receiving periodic payments from some source, but there was no documentary evidence of the source of such payments, it was proper to remand to the Board of Review to take additional evidence on that issue, since the nature and source of the payments must be known in order to make a proper determination in the case. Morris v. Everett, 3 Ark. App. 280A, 625 S.W.2d 551 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an administrative agency fails to make a finding upon a pertinent issue of fact, the courts do not decide the question in the first instance; the cause is remanded to the agency so a finding can be made on that issue. Thus, where the Board of Review, in holding that the defendant was liable for overpayments he had received, failed to consider whether the principles of equity and good conscience would be violated by requiring him to repay the benefits, the board's decision would be remanded. Lawrence v. Everett, 9 Ark. App. 138, 653 S.W.2d 140 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand ordering the Board of Review enter an award requiring that unemployment benefits be paid to the employee was proper where he was an inmate who was transferred so as to render it impossible for him to continue in the company's employment; further, although subdivision (c)(2)(A) of this section authorized the appellate court to order that additional evidence be taken before the board, it did not issue such a directive. Rankin v. Dir,. Empl. Sec. Dep't, 82 Ark. App. 575, 120 S.W.3d 169 (2003).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A reviewing court is required to view the testimony in the light most favorable to the successful party, if there is any rational basis for the board's findings based upon substantial evidence. Rose v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 679, 599 S.W.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1980); Everett v. Jones, 277 Ark. 162, 639 S.W.2d 739 (1982); Farmer v. Everett, 8 Ark. App. 23, 648 S.W.2d 513 (1983); Haig v. Everett, 8 Ark. App. 255, 650 S.W.2d 593 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decisions of the Board of Review are reversible on appeal to the courts only if they are found to be arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and without substantial evidence to support them or in cases of fraud or corruption. Willis Johnson Co. v. Daniels, 269 Ark. 795, 601 S.W.2d 890 (Ct. App. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though there was evidence in the record upon which the Board of Review might have reached a different result, the scope of judicial review was limited by this section, and the reviewing court was not privileged to substitute its findings for those of the Board of Review even though the court might have reached a different conclusion had it made the original determination upon the same evidence considered by the board. Stagecoach Motel v. Krause, 267 Ark. 1093, 593 S.W.2d 495 (Ct. App. 1980); Feagin v. Everett, 9 Ark. App. 59, 652 S.W.2d 839 (1983); Shipley Baking Co. v. Stiles, 17 Ark. App. 72, 703 S.W.2d 465 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding held not supported by substantial evidence. Victor Indus. Corp. v. Daniels, 1 Ark. App. 6, 611 S.W.2d 794 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In unemployment compensation cases, the scope of review by the court is governed by the substantial evidence rule. Substantial evidence is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable person might accept as adequately supporting the conclusion. Haig v. Everett, 8 Ark. App. 255, 650 S.W.2d 593 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the appeal tribunal nor the Board of Review is bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence. Haynes v. Director of Labor, 19 Ark. App. 71, 719 S.W.2d 437 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal, the findings of fact of the Board of Review are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, i.e., by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; appellate review is limited to determining whether the Board could reasonably reach its decision upon the evidence before it, and in making that determination, the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom are reviewed in the light most favorable to the Board's findings. White v. Director, Ark. Emp. Sec. Dep't, 54 Ark. App. 197, 924 S.W.2d 823 (1996).

       The Court of Appeals has no authority to extend the deadline for filing a petition for review. Wooten v. Daniels, 271 Ark. 131, 607 S.W.2d 96 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employer never received written notice of determination, employer's appeal was timely under this section despite fact that it was filed after the permitted time for filing, since the fact that notice is not received is a circumstance beyond the employer's control. Sprindale Farms v. Daniels, 1 Ark. App. 89, 613 S.W.2d 117 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's argument that her appeal was untimely because of concentrated effort to secure employment was not an acceptable defense. Nichols v. Stiles, 11 Ark. App. 212, 668 S.W.2d 554 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenges to an application for unemployment benefits must be made in the first instance in a prompt manner or be lost, unless unmistakably reserved in the original determination. Davis v. Stiles, 287 Ark. 261, 698 S.W.2d 287 (1985), rehearing denied, 287 Ark. 261, 700 S.W.2d 369 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's motions for rule on the clerk were denied because the petitions for review were filed outside the twenty-day period provided in subsection (a); the court had no authority to extend the deadline for filing a petition for review, because the time for appeal from administrative agency determinations is a legislative matter. Green v. Director, 50 Ark. App. 208, 901 S.W.2d 860 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although subdivision (b)(1) of this section provides that the Director shall file a certified copy of the record, this section does not specify a time period in which this must be done; although sanctions were not applied because there has not been precedent for applying sanctions for simply failing to file the record on appeal within 90 days after the notice of appeal has been filed by a claimant, the appellate court might in the future consider this opinion sufficient advance warning. Brown v. Director, Emp. Sec. Div., 54 Ark. App. 205, 924 S.W.2d 492 (1996).

       Before a claimant who has been paid benefits to which she was not entitled can be required to repay the amount so received, due process requires that she has been afforded the opportunity of a hearing, after proper notice, upon all the issues set out in this section. Prichett v. Director of Labor, 5 Ark. App. 194, 634 S.W.2d 397 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       If an unemployment compensation claimant has been paid benefits to which he was not entitled, due process requires that his liability to repay the amount so received must be determined after he has been afforded the opportunity of a hearing, after proper notice, upon all the issues set out in this section. Farmer v. Everett, 8 Ark. App. 23, 648 S.W.2d 513 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported a determination that the appellant was liable to repay $1,155 based upon a finding that he received benefits to which he was not entitled and that it would not violate equity and good conscience to require repayment where (1) after receiving benefits, the appellant was later disqualified by a decision of the Appeal Tribunal, which decision was not appealed and became final, and (2) at the time of the hearing on the repayment question, the appellant was unemployed, his wife was earning $ 30 per week, their monthly expenses for necessities were approximately $ 1,000, they owned their own home, they also owned a 1993 Buick Regal and a 1992 Nissan pickup, both paid-in-full, and they had about $ 14,000 in savings. Trigg v. Director Ark. Empl. Sec. Dep't, 72 Ark. App. 266, 34 S.W.3d 783 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to subdivision (b)(1)(B) of this section, requiring a worker to repay the overpayment of benefits would violate principles of equity and good conscience where there was substantial evidence that his wife's sources of funds were extremely limited, due to the fact that she was attending school, and the household expenses exceeded the household income. Peterson v. Dir., Empl. Sec. Dep't, 90 Ark. App. 19, 203 S.W.3d 655 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the appellate court was unable to reconcile the Arkansas Board of Review's findings of claimant's expenditures with the facts in the record, and where claimant had no savings, the board's decision to hold her liable to repay the overpaid unemployment benefits under subdivision (b)(1) of this section was not supported by substantial evidence. Tilson v. Dir., Ark. Empl. Sec. Dep't., 91 Ark. App. 111, 208 S.W.3d 819 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case concerning the repayment of unemployment benefits under subsection (b) of this section, a claimant was at fault in causing an overpayment for the time period after she filed a disability claim. However, a remand was necessary as to whether the claimant was at fault for overpayment during the time period before she filed for disability; although the claimant was subsequently determined by the Social Security Administration to be totally disabled for this time period, the claimant thought she was physically capable of working according to her testimony.
   Johnson v. Director, Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2013 Ark. App. 74 (2013).

      <p>
       Unemployment insurance benefits claimant was required to repay benefit amounts he was overpaid because given that he had a fixed income, a small household with no mortgage on his home, and significant monthly income remaining after paying expenses, recovery was not against equity and good conscience.
   Worden v. Director, Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2013 Ark. App. 579 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal Tribunal's decision finding an employee liable to repay unemployment benefits was remanded because it was not found that he made a “knowing” misrepresentation or omission to the Department of Workforce Services, or, if such findings were made regarding a related overpayment proceeding, the findings were not in the record on appeal, so the Appeal Tribunal rendered no findings on the issue presented of whether the employee's failure to correctly report his earnings during certain weeks was knowingly fraudulent, under subsection (a) of this section.
   Patterson v. Dir., 2014 Ark. App. 113 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the debtor sought to characterize two certificates of overpayment of unemployment benefits as judicial liens amenable to avoidance and not statutory liens that would not be avoidable, analysis of facts and appropriate law compelled the conclusion that the certificates represented avoidable judicial liens as they did not arise solely by force of a statute on specified circumstances or conditions, but rather as a result of other legal or equitable process or proceeding, as defined in the Bankruptcy Code.

      Acts 2013, No. 956, § 10: Emergency clause failed to pass. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the Department of Workforce Services must ensure the prompt determination of claims for unemployment insurance benefits; that the state's unemployment insurance program must remain in conformity with federal law requirements; and that this act is immediately necessary because a delay would interfere with continued provision of benefits and services to eligible persons. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2013.”

     </p>
     <p>
      “(a)
   
   It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that federal law requires the implementation of state-level workforce development acts to authorize federal funding for workforce development programs; that the Arkansas Workforce Development Board must begin work immediately to prepare for the inauguration of local workforce development boards; that the first phase of work by the Arkansas Workforce Development Board must be completed to coincide with the beginning of the 2015-2016 fiscal year on July 1, 2015. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c04s15-4-37" target="_blank">15-4-37</a></cite>-3704 being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b)
   
   It is found and determined by the General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the effectiveness of this act on July 1, 2015, is essential to the inauguration of the programs for which this act is provided, and that in the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the effective date of this act beyond July 1, 2015, could work irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential programs created in the act. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and, except for § <cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c04s15-4-3704" target="_blank">15-4-3704</a></cite>, this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2015.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the Department of Workforce Services must ensure the prompt determination of claims for unemployment insurance benefits and the current stabilization tax set aside for the Department of Workforce Services Unemployment Insurance Administration Fund is set to expire on June 30, 2019; that the state's unemployment insurance program must maintain proper authority to process claims for unemployment insurance benefits; and that this act is immediately necessary because a delay would cause a potential service disruption for programs served by the Department of Workforce Services Training Trust Fund and Department of Workforce Services Unemployment Insurance Administration Fund. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

       Circuit court properly concluded that a predecessor employer had not received the requisite notice of the Arkansas Employment Security Department's original determination until November 2003 because the annual notices of the rate of contribution that were sent to the successor employer under § <cite class="ocar"><a href="#t11c10s11-10-707ol1c" target="_self">11-10-707(c)</a></cite> were not notices of a determination under subdivision (d)(1) of this section.

       <ol>
        <li id="t11c10s11-10-723ol1a1">
         If an employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion thereof, to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is any common ownership, management, or control of the two (2) employers, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business, or portion thereof, shall be combined with the employer to whom the business is transferred. The combining of experience and recalculation of applicable employer tax rates shall be made effective the first day of the calendar quarter following the date of transfer of the trade or business, or portion thereof. The transfer of some or all of an employer's workforce to another employer shall be considered a transfer of trade or business, or portion thereof; and
        </li>
        <li id="t11c10s11-10-723ol1a2">
         If following a transfer of experience under subdivision (a)(1) of this section or transfer of experience as otherwise provided in this chapter involving only a portion of a trade or business, the Director of the Division of Workforce Services determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, then the experience rating accounts of the employers involved shall be combined into a single account and a single rate assigned to such an account effective the first day of the calendar quarter following the date of transfer.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t11c10s11-10-723ol1b">
       Whenever a person is not an employer under this chapter at the time it acquires the trade or business of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired business shall not be transferred to that person if the director finds that that person acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. Instead, that person shall be assigned the new employer rate under this chapter. In determining whether the business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the director shall use objective factors that may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long that business enterprise was continued, or whether substantial numbers of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to acquisition.

         Knowing violations or attempted violations of subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section or any other provision of this subchapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate shall result in an additional two-percent rate increase for the rate year during which the violation or attempted violation occurred and a two-percent additional rate increase in each of the following three (3) rate years. In addition to the rate increases, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of total taxes due shall also be assessed in each of these rate years. All penalty amounts shall be deposited and credited to the Division of Workforce Services Special Fund as set out in § 11-10-716. The additional tax and penalty required by this subsection shall not be credited to the separate account of any employer, nor shall any employer whose contribution rate has been affected by this subsection be eligible to make a voluntary payment pursuant to § 11-10-705(c).

         If a person knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a violation of subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section, the person shall be subject to a penalty of five thousand dollars ($5,000) plus ten percent (10%) of the total taxes due from the person violating subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section for any rate year in which a violation occurred. All penalty amounts shall be deposited and credited to the fund as set out in § 11-10-716.
        </li>
        <li id="t11c10s11-10-723ol1c3">
         The rate increases and penalties set forth in this subchapter along with any interest that may accrue as a result of these rate increases and penalties shall be in addition to any other rate increases, penalties, and interest provided in this chapter and shall be subject to collection as provided for in §§ 11-10-716 — 11-10-722.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act should go into effect as soon as possible in order to assure the prompt determination of claims for unemployment benefits and the continued provision of benefits and services to eligible persons. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
