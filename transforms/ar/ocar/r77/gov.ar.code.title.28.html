An emergency is therefore declared to exist, and this Act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, welfare and safety, shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval.”

        Child.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The General Assembly did not intend for a grandchild to be defined as a child under subdivision (a)(1) of this section. McCoy v. Walker, 317 Ark. 86, 876 S.W.2d 252 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there is no comma separating “illegitimate child” and the modifier “except such as would inherit under the law of descent and distribution” in subdivision (a)(1) of this section, the General Assembly intended for “except such as would inherit…” to modify only “illegitimate children.” McCoy v. Walker, 317 Ark. 86, 876 S.W.2d 252 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “except such as would inherit under the law of descent and distribution” in subdivision (a)(1) of this section does not modify the word “grandchild.” McCoy v. Walker, 317 Ark. 86, 876 S.W.2d 252 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The minor grandchildren of a decedent who would inherit from the decedent under the laws of descent and distribution do not have homestead rights under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-201" target="_self">28-39-201</a></cite>, because they do not fall within the definition of “child” in subdivision (a)(1) of this section. McCoy v. Walker, 317 Ark. 86, 876 S.W.2d 252 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Decedent's illegitimate, pretermitted child was not entitled to inherit from decedent as he was required to meet requirements of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-407ol1b" target="_self">28-39-407(b)</a></cite>, subdivision (a)(1) of this section, and the six requirements of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c09s28-9-209ol1d" target="_self">28-9-209(d)</a></cite>, but he failed to show that he had been recognized by the decedent or by a court and he failed to file his action within 180 days of decedent's death.

        Claims.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Definition of word “claims” used in Probate Code to include estate taxes applies to “claims” only as it is used in Probate Code and has nothing to do with the apportionment of estate taxes. Williamson v. Williamson, 224 Ark. 141, 272 S.W.2d 72 (Ark. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a lawsuit pending in a circuit court was not a claim against the estate, but was a suit against the executor individually, the court did not err in closing the estate since there was no pending claim against the estate as defined by subdivision (2) of this section. Bostic v. Bostic Estate, 281 Ark. 167, 662 S.W.2d 815 (1984).

   Both the widow and heirs at law are distributees of a solvent intestate estate under this section and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c53s28-53-113" target="_self">28-53-113</a></cite> and therefore secured debts are to be discharged out of the general estate, unpledged personal property, where the creditor does not pursue the security which gives the widow a dower right in the entire security free from the debt.

       Where administrator is removed for failure to qualify and physical incapacity, it is unnecessary for the court to determine whether person bringing matter to court's attention was an interested party. Davis v. Adams, 231 Ark. 197, 328 S.W.2d 851 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Since, under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c25s28-25-102" target="_self">28-25-102</a></cite>, an attesting witness to be “interested” must receive a beneficial interest by way of devise, an attorney signing will as attesting witness was not “interested,” although the firm with which he was associated was named to represent the estate. Rosenbaum v. Cahn, 234 Ark. 290, 351 S.W.2d 857 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       One claiming damages for the alleged negligence of the decedent is not an interested person within the definition of this section. Doepke v. Smith, 248 Ark. 511, 452 S.W.2d 627 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where plaintiffs filed an action against the administrator prior to his resignation as administrator, plaintiffs were “interested parties” within the meaning of this section and “aggrieved parties” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-116" target="_self">28-1-116</a></cite> for purposes of appealing from probate orders that affected those proceedings. However, as such a resignation is ordinarily a matter of discretion for the probate judge and in this case had no effect on venue and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c48s28-48-107" target="_self">28-48-107</a></cite> gives plaintiffs a remedy for the appointment of another administrator, there was no abuse of discretion in allowing the resignation to stand. Barkley v. Cullum, 252 Ark. 474, 479 S.W.2d 535 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a trial judge rejects the report on the public sale of estate land, the status of the parties who had bid for the land can no longer be described as interested parties; at best, their position is that of potential bidders at any future sale, and hence they have no standing to contest a petition on behalf of the heirs of an estate. Estate of Hodges v. Wilkie, 14 Ark. App. 297, 688 S.W.2d 307 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where the decedent died testate and left them nothing under the will, the decedent's surviving children were not heirs and were not creditors, and were thus not “interested persons” as that term is used in subdivision (a)(11) of this section, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c48s28-48-105ol1a2" target="_self">28-48-105(a)(2)</a></cite>, or §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c48s28-48-107ol1a" target="_self">28-48-107(a)</a></cite>. Pickens v. Black, 316 Ark. 499, 872 S.W.2d 405 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       On petition to probate court to set aside order authorizing sale of decedent's land, where petitioners were not heirs or creditors, where their petition did not assert any claim against the estate or declare any interest in the estate's property, and where they did not indicate any entitlement to proceeds which might be distributed by the estate, but in fact were persons against whom the estate had sought relief, the petitioners were not interested persons as defined by subdivision (a)(11) and had no standing to question the issuance of the court's order. White v. Welsh, 323 Ark. 479, 915 S.W.2d 274 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellant was an “interested person” as defined in subdivision (a)(11) where appellant was specifically named in the will as a beneficiary of a trust; the fact that appellant was a beneficiary of the trust meant that appellant had “an interest in the estate.” Spicer v. Estate of Spicer, 55 Ark. App. 267, 935 S.W.2d 576 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellants were interested persons entitled to seek removal of an estate's personal representative where they were potential heirs of the intestate estate. Snowden v. Riggins, 70 Ark. App. 1, 13 S.W.3d 598 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although appellant argued that there was no evidence that anyone received notice of the hearing set on the final accounting, which appellant claimed violated §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-112" target="_self">28-1-112</a></cite>, the argument was without merit, given the notices that the trial court sent out after excluding appellant from distribution of the estate, and appellant conceded to having received actual notice in any event and possibly not having been entitled to notice in the first place; because appellant had been excluded, she was not an interested person under subdivision (11) of this section and so there was no legal requirement that she be served notice, and she lacked standing to complain about the failure to send notice to others who had not appealed.
   Seymour v. Biehslich, 371 Ark. 359, 266 S.W.3d 722 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellee was not an “interested person” as defined in subdivision (a)(11) of this section with standing to petition the probate court. Appellee failed to offer any testimony that there was a service contract between the decedent and herself, and there was no evidence that the services she provided for the decedent were of any extraordinary character.
   Lucas v. Wilson, 2011 Ark. App. 584, 385 S.W.3d 891 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because appellant, an heir of the decedent and devisee under the will, was made a party to the probate action when the circuit court granted his motion to intervene under Ark. R. Civ. P. 24, the circuit court erred by determining that he was not entitled to notice of a hearing on a motion to remove the estate executrix. The Court of Appeals of Arkansas held that appellant was an “interested person” as defined in subdivision (11) of this section.
   Maxwell v. Estate of Maxwell, 2012 Ark. App. 174 (2012).

       Probate court erred in finding that the limited liability company lacked standing to bring a petition for the determination of heirship, because the limited liability company alleged in the petition that it was a legal entity, so it was a person and could bring the petition; “person” was defined under subdivision (18) of this section to include a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity.

       Proceeding in 1950 to probate will of person who died in 1935 was not barred by five-year limitation period contained in 1949 Code, since Probate Code is not retroactive. Hudson v. Hudson, 219 Ark. 211, 242 S.W.2d 154 (1951).

       This section is not retroactive, and therefore a probate court was not authorized to hear a petition to set aside prior order of probate court disposing of estate in 1943 on grounds that petitioner was actual heir since only the circuit or chancery courts could determine questions of heirship at that time.

        Adoption.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The probate court is vested with both inherent and statutory authority to close adoption records; a writ of prohibition will not lie to prevent a probate court from sealing adoption records. Dougan v. Gray, 318 Ark. 6, 884 S.W.2d 239 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   For purposes of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.09.html#t09c09s9-9-212" target="_blank">9-9-212</a></cite>, appellants claimed that the failure to file a home study for the adoption of the child was jurisdictional and required reversal; however, under subdivision (5) of this section, the trial court had jurisdiction to determine the child's adoption and any error in relying on appellees’ home study had to be raised in the trial court to be preserved for review.
   Wilson v. Golen, 2013 Ark. App. 267, 427 S.W.3d 723 (2013).

        Authority of Court.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A probate court has authority, on a proper showing, to set aside any order that it makes at the same term of court. Knight v. Worthen Bank & Trust Co., 233 Ark. 465, 345 S.W.2d 361 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to establish lost will, probate court must follow dictates of this section. Conkle v. Walker, 294 Ark. 222, 742 S.W.2d 892 (1988).

       <b>
        Chancery Courts.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Chancery courts could interfere in guardians' settlements to correct fraud, or relieve against accident, or upon some other acknowledged ground of equity jurisdiction. Nelson v. Cowling, 77 Ark. 351, 91 S.W. 773 (1906) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancery court has no jurisdiction to probate wills or settle and distribute a decedent's estate even though a will has not been probated nor letters of administration issued. Gaylor v. Gaylor, 224 Ark. 644, 275 S.W.2d 644 (1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The distribution of assets contained in a deceased husband's testamentary marital trust need not pass through the wife's estate; the probate court acted properly by deferring the trust and distribution issues to the chancery court. Clement v. Larkey, 314 Ark. 488A, 314 Ark. 498, 863 S.W.2d 578 (1993).

        Claims Against Estate.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>
   It was not error for the probate court to grant the petition of administrator to grant a lien upon decedent's real estate and to revive a judgment allowing claims, as §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c50s28-50-105" target="_self">28-50-105</a></cite> specifically permits an order allowing claims against an estate the effect of a judgment, and this section gives the probate court the same powers to carry out its judgments as exist in courts of general equity. Price v. Price, 253 Ark. 1124, 491 S.W.2d 793 (1973).

       <b>
        Closing of Estate.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       While a probate court is not the proper forum to enforce contractual rights, where a contract provided for completion after close of administration and no action was being taken to close estate, it was proper to bring proceedings in the probate court to obtain a closing of the estate. Davis v. Adams, 231 Ark. 197, 328 S.W.2d 851 (1959).

       <b>
        Collateral Attack.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>
   In collateral proceeding attacking judgment of a probate court, every fact necessary to give the court jurisdiction will be conclusively presumed in favor of jurisdiction where the record is silent. Redditt v. Hale, 199 F.2d 386 (8th Cir. 1952), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">345 U.S. 908</cite>, <cite class="s_court">73 S. Ct. 647</cite> (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The judgment of a probate court approving accounts of resident guardian of nonresident incompetents could not be attacked in collateral proceeding in federal district court where no fraud was charged, but only that resident guardian had not realized as much as should have been realized. Redditt v. Hale, 199 F.2d 386 (8th Cir. 1952), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">345 U.S. 908</cite>, <cite class="s_court">73 S. Ct. 647</cite> (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a probate court has acted within its jurisdiction, its judgments are not open to collateral attack. When a probate court acts without its jurisdiction, however, its judgments are void and subject to collateral attack. Filk v. Beatty, 298 Ark. 40, 764 S.W.2d 454 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment cannot be collaterally attacked unless it is void on the face of the record or the probate court is shown to have lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Rowland v. Farm Credit Bank, 41 Ark. App. 79, 848 S.W.2d 433 (1993).
      </p>

        Dower.

       A probate court had jurisdiction in matters of dower. Carter v. Younger, 112 Ark. 483, 166 S.W. 547 (1914) (decision under prior law).

       A probate court had no jurisdiction to enforce a compromise of a ward's claim against an insurance company, such jurisdiction being in the circuit court. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co. v. Boggs, 188 Ark. 604, 66 S.W.2d 1077 (1934) (decision under prior law).

      <p>
       Probate courts were held to be without jurisdiction to confer equitable relief; however in probate matters properly brought before them they could apply equitable doctrines. Jones v. Graham, 36 Ark. 383 (1880) (decision under prior law).

      <p>
       <p>
   Although not specifically enumerated in this section, an appellate court had jurisdiction over a request to exhume a body because the decedent's personal representative petitioned the probate division of the circuit court, during administration of the decedent's estate, to enforce a provision in the decedent's will by ordering exhumation and reburial and probate orders were appealable pursuant to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-116ol1a" target="_self">28-1-116(a)</a></cite> and Ark.

       A probate court had no jurisdiction of a claim by an attorney for services in prosecution of claim in behalf of an estate. Pike v. Thomas, 62 Ark. 223, 35 S.W. 212 (1896); Parker & Parker v. Mayo, 72 Ark. 513, 83 S.W. 324 (1904) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A probate court had no jurisdiction to audit claim against administrator for heirs' attorney's fee. Paget v. Brogan, 67 Ark. 522, 55 S.W. 938 (1900) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate courts could authorize the employment of counsel by the administrator and could allow fees for such services rendered as necessary expenses of administration. Paget v. Brogan, 67 Ark. 522, 55 S.W. 938 (1900) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the term at which fees of an attorney and a guardian had been ordered was allowed to lapse, the executor could not have an order allowing the fees set aside except by filing a petition which complied with the requirements of former Arkansas Statutes Annotated §§ 29-506 and 29-508.

       A probate court had only such jurisdiction as was conferred by statute and the Arkansas Constitution. Lewis v. Rutherford, 71 Ark. 218, 72 S.W. 373 (1903) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of probate courts was limited in its general scope as to the subject matter to the undisputed property of decedents and of wards, and, as to persons, to those interested in such property as equitably or legally entitled to some distributive share therein, or in the residue, and as to creditors who voluntarily, upon general notice and without special citation, present their claims. Huff v. Hot Springs Savs., Trust & Guar. Co., 185 Ark. 20, 45 S.W.2d 508 (1932) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The probate court is a court of special and limited jurisdiction, having only such jurisdiction and powers as are conferred by the constitution or by statute, or necessarily incidental to the exercise of the jurisdiction and powers specifically granted. Carpenter v. Logan, 281 Ark. 184, 662 S.W.2d 808 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lost or destroyed wills are generally established by an action in chancery, but probate court has additional jurisdiction in matters of heirship, adoption, and, concurrent with jurisdiction of other courts, jurisdiction to restore lost wills and for the construction of wills when incident to the administration of an estate. Conkle v. Walker, 294 Ark. 222, 742 S.W.2d 892 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the Arkansas Constitution nor this section confers on probate courts jurisdiction to administer a trust created by a will. Clement v. Larkey, 314 Ark. 488A, 314 Ark. 498, 863 S.W.2d 578 (1993).

       The construction, interpretation, and operation of trusts are matters within the jurisdiction of the courts of equity; neither the Arkansas Constitution nor this section confers on probate courts jurisdiction to administer a trust created by a will. Long Trust v. Holk, 315 Ark. 112, 864 S.W.2d 869 (1993).

       The probate court had subject matter jurisdiction to determine title to the real property where the appellant was a beneficiary of the testator's will, even though appellant was not acting in that capacity by asserting her claim to this property. Williams ex rel. Tucker v. Titterington, 46 Ark. App. 322, 881 S.W.2d 226 (1994).

   Generally speaking, lost or destroyed wills are established by an action in chancery under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c40s28-40-301" target="_self">28-40-301</a></cite>; however, subdivision (a)(6) of this section grants probate court jurisdiction (concurrent with the jurisdiction other courts) over the restoration of lost wills and for the construction of wills when incident to the administration of an estate. Gilbert v. Gilbert, 47 Ark. App. 37, 883 S.W.2d 859 (1994).

       Trial court erred in awarding a law firm an attorney's fee of $11,902.47 as the claim was barred by res judicata as: (1) in a first suit, the firm was denied relief for breach of contract and quantum meruit; (2) Ark. Const. Amend. 80 granted the trial court jurisdiction to rule on all claims of relief, legal and equitable; (3) jurisdiction was proper in the first suit under this section, and the first suit fully and finally settled all issues between the firm and the clients; and (4) both suits involved the same parties, and the same claims.

       The jurisdiction of the probate court over the estates of deceased persons was held to be confined to the administration of assets which came under its control and, incidentally, to compel the discovery of assets. Shane v. Dickson, 111 Ark. 353, 163 S.W. 1140 (1914) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A probate court had jurisdiction to require an executor to disclose assets of the estate, including what, if anything, he owed the estate on notes or otherwise and to require him to charge himself with any amount he may have wrongfully paid to himself or to others without presenting the claim to the court for allowance. Gocio v. Seamster, 203 Ark. 937, 160 S.W.2d 194 (1942) (decision under prior law).

       Where a probate judge dismissed a petition for an accounting filed by an executor and a third party complaint filed by the widow and the dismissals were without prejudice to have the matters heard in the chancery court, the dismissals were not clearly erroneous, since the chancery court had the power to give an accounting even though it could have been had in the probate court where the matter was pending.

   Although appellant argued that there was no evidence that anyone received notice of the hearing set on the final accounting, which appellant claimed violated this section, the argument was without merit, given the notices that the trial court sent out after excluding appellant from distribution of the estate, and appellant conceded to having received actual notice in any event and possibly not having been entitled to notice in the first place; because appellant had been excluded, she was not an interested person under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-102ol111" target="_self">28-1-102(11)</a></cite> and so there was no legal requirement that she be served notice, and she lacked standing to complain about the failure to send notice to others who had not appealed.

       On the question of whether service on a court-appointed attorney for an absent military mother was sufficient service of process in a case of continuing jurisdiction on the issues of custody and guardianship, it was undisputed that service was made on the mother's attorney of record, and thus, the service of notice was in compliance with subsection (e) of this section. Finney v. Cook, 351 Ark. 367, 94 S.W.3d 333 (2002).

       Issue raised by an attorney regarding violation of his due-process rights allegedly resulting from a circuit court's appointment of an attorney-ad-litem without notice, without a hearing, and without adequate time to respond would have had no practical effect on the controversy, would have been purely advisory, and was moot because the attorney-ad-litem had performed the services requested by the circuit court and the circuit court had already rendered a ruling in the case.

       Where a contest of will had already been filed at time will was admitted to probate, there was no time period in which contest had to be filed, and court could vacate or modify its order admitting will to probate, for good cause, at any time within period allowed for appeal after final termination of administration of estate. Even if court had felt admitting will to probate was res judicata on validity of will, it could have vacated its order because probate case was still open. Carpenter v. Horace Mann Life Ins.

       Notwithstanding the provisions of ARCP 60, subsection (a) allows a probate court to vacate or modify its orders at any time before the time for appeal has elapsed after the final termination of the estate. White v. Toney, 37 Ark. App. 36, 823 S.W.2d 921 (1992).

       A probate order may be vacated or modified at any time before a final order is entered, notwithstanding the dictates of Ark. R. Civ. P. Rule 60(b). Snowden v. Riggins, 70 Ark. App. 1, 13 S.W.3d 598 (2000).

       <p>
   In accordance with Ark. R. Civ. P. 81, it is precisely because the probate code and the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure set forth different time limits on the court's authority to modify or vacate prior orders that this section applies in probate proceedings; thus, an appeal under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-116" target="_self">28-1-116</a></cite> was timely since Ark.

      When an appeal is taken from the order of final distribution in the administration of a decedent's estate, all prior appealable orders and judgments to which the appellant has filed objections in writing within sixty (60) days after the order of judgment was rendered and from which an appeal has not been taken, except orders admitting or denying the probate of a will or appointing a personal representative, shall be reviewed at the election of the appellant. The appellant shall indicate the election by clearly stating in the appeal the orders which he or she desires to have reviewed.

      Acts 2003, No. 1885, § 273, purported to amend this section in its entirety, but did not set out subsections (f) and (g) as expressly repealed. The Arkansas Code Revision Commission does not construe the omission of subsections (f) and (g) by Acts 2003, No 1885, § 273, as an implied repeal of those subsections. Accordingly, subsections (f) and (g) have been included in this section as set out above.

       This section provides for appeals from probate causes involving wills, estates, and fiduciary relationships; it was enacted in 1949 and was in effect at the time ARAP 2 was adopted and, therefore, determines whether there is a right of appeal in a case involving orders of the probate court. Pickens v. Black, 316 Ark. 499, 872 S.W.2d 405 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Law and rules applicable to appeals from equity courts apply equally to appeals from probate court, except as otherwise provided in the probate code. In re Vesa, 319 Ark. 574, 892 S.W.2d 491 (1995).

       Right to review by the Supreme Court lies from all probate court orders other than an order removing a fiduciary for failure to give a new bond or render an accounting required by the court, or an order appointing a special administrator. In re Vesa, 319 Ark. 574, 892 S.W.2d 491 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a right to review lies from all probate orders other than an order removing a fiduciary for failure to give bond or to render a required accounting or an order appointing a special administrator under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, claimant's appeal from the order denying the motion to enter an order was properly before the court.

      </p>
      <p>
       Decedent’s son’s appeal was dismissed because prior to a hearing on the admission of the will to probate, he executed a waiver and entry of appearance and a disclaimer of his interest in the decedent’s estate, did not file a notice of appeal of an order staying the matter until a final distribution was made, and despite the denial of his motion to supplement the record, he included in his addendum materials found only in the supplemental volume and did not include certain necessary documents.

       Circuit court did not err in appointing a sister as guardian over her sibling, an incapacitated adult, because the circuit court acted with its authority when it continued to enter orders while a brother's appeal was pending; the circuit court faced changed circumstances that called for immediate action because it was grappling with a situation in which the terms of its orders had not been fulfilled, and subdivision (e)(1) of this section did not preclude the circuit court from exercising that kind of judicial authority.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because a guardianship case, like a child-custody or child-support case, involves ongoing events in the life of a person who is dependent on the court for protection, the court must continually exercise its powers, where changed conditions warrant, to safeguard those persons whose needs cannot wait a year or more while an appeal makes its way through the courts.

   Although not specifically enumerated in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-104" target="_self">28-1-104</a></cite>, an appellate court had jurisdiction over a request to exhume a body because the decedent's personal representative petitioned the probate division of the circuit court, during administration of the decedent's estate, to enforce a provision in the decedent's will by ordering exhumation and reburial and probate orders were appealable pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and Ark.

       Once a person's incompetency is established, that incompetency is presumed to continue until a change has been established by proof.

       Probate court had jurisdiction to set aside its previous order determining heirship, because there was an extended period during which courts had jurisdiction to modify or vacate orders in probate proceedings, there had not been a final termination of the proceedings, and it was not entirely clear that the order determining heirship would have ended the proceedings.

      </p>
      <p>
       In an appeal from an order appointing a permanent guardian of the person and estate of appellant's husband, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to appoint special administrators to act on appellant's behalf following her death after the record was lodged on appeal. Because the appeal did not have an appellant to prosecute the appeal, it was dismissed.
   Guenther v. Guenther, 2018 Ark. App. 538, 566 S.W.3d 132 (2018) (petition for special administrators was filed before the January 1, 2018 effective date of Ark. R. App. P. Civil 12).

       Appeal from a motion to increase distribution was not an appeal from the final order of distribution, and had nothing to do with the manner of administration; rather, it was an attempt to appeal for the second time an earlier order denying probate of the codicil and denying that the church disclaimed its interest, and was barred by subsection (d) of this section and the doctrine of res judicata.

       Where heirs at law attacked probate of will and filed petitions asking for removal of executor on the ground that he failed to include certain assets in the inventory and, while matters were pending, the probate court granted a petition for appointment of a special administrator for purpose of filing proceedings against executors and others, the appointment of a special administrator was proper since probate court had original and exclusive jurisdiction to appoint a special administrator.

      </p>
      <p>
       By declining to determine the appellants' heirship claims, the probate court did not impliedly stay any appeal of its order until final distribution; the court's order gave no indication of any intent to curtail the appellants' right to appeal, but only to clarify and restrict the scope of the order and, additionally, the order appealed from was largely concerned with the appointment of a personal representative and thus was not encompassed by subsection (c) of this section. Snowden v. Riggins, 70 Ark. App. 1, 13 S.W.3d 598 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       In response to a jurisdictional argument under subdivision (e)(1) of this section, an appellate court considered a recusal argument in a probate matter out of an abundance of caution, even though there were no specific findings of no prejudice or a specific order permitting further proceedings in the order of a companion case.

   In accordance with Ark. R. Civ.

      </p>
      <p>
       Appeals from a circuit court's order construing a decedent's will in the widow's favor were timely, under subsections (a) and (g) of this section, because (1) any attempt to appeal from the partial summary judgment would have been a nullity because the partial summary judgment lacked finality because it was obviously partial and other issues remained, and the partial summary judgment did not contain an Ark. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification allowing for an immediate appeal; (2) the partial summary judgment became final on July 31, 2006, when judgment was entered disposing of the remaining claims; (3) motions for new trial were filed and, under Ark. R. App. P. Civ. 4(b), such motions extended the time for all parties to file their notice of appeal; and (4) the older children filed their notice of appeal on September 18, 2006.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because the notice of appeal by the trustee of the residuary beneficiary was timely filed within 30 days from entry of the circuit court's interlocutory order on Oct. 19, 2017, the appellate court had jurisdiction over the appeal and could review the circuit court's failure to enforce a family-settlement agreement. However, the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to hear a cross-appeal advancing a challenge to the family-settlement agreement because the contingent beneficiary did not file a notice of appeal within 30 days from the entry of the court's June 2, 2017, interlocutory order approving the family-settlement agreement.

   Where an order of the probate court on May 18, 1978, assigned dower and homestead rights to the widow and directed that certain other payments be made to her, the order was final as to dower and homestead rights and was an appealable order, so that, whether the 30-day (§<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c67s16-67-310" target="_blank">16-67-310</a></cite> [superseded]) or 60-day (§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-116" target="_self">28-1-116</a></cite>) time limit for appeals was applicable, the executor's appeal was not timely when he appealed from an order of May 15, 1979, wherein the court directed compliance with its former order of May 18, 1978.

      </p>
      <p>
       Court lacked jurisdiction to address the claimant's argument that the circuit court erred in approving the settlement, where the claimant neither filed an objection pursuant to subsection (d) of this section to preserve the issue as part of the appeal from the order of final distribution, nor did he file a timely notice of appeal to appeal the order separately.

      <p>
       <p>
   Former attorney's appeal from a probate court's order striking the former attorney's response to a motion for modification and declaratory judgment and discovery requests was dismissed with prejudice because (1) the order striking the response was the only issue raised on appeal, (2) the order striking the response was an appealable order, under Ark. R. App. P. Civ. 2(a)(4), (3) the order striking the response was not reviewable under subsection (d) of this section as being an appealable order entered prior to a final order of distribution, as no final order of distribution meeting the requirements of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c53s28-53-104" target="_self">28-53-104</a></cite> was entered, (4) even if the contested order were viewed as an order of a probate court, rather than an order striking a response, the appeal was still untimely, as the order was appealable at the interlocutory stage, under Ark. R. App. P. Civ. 2(a)(12) and this section, and (5) the appeal was not timely filed under Ark. R. App. P. Civ. 4(a).

   District court concluded that the Arkansas Supreme Court would extend its decision in Aka, which held that wrongful death suits could be brought on behalf of unborn, viable fetuses, to allow a negligence suit to be filed on a child's behalf, seeking to recover for alleged negligently-inflicted injuries that the child sustained in utero, before she was born. The district court noted that the state supreme court had found persuasive the state legislature's decision to expand the definition of “person” in the homicide and probate laws, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c01s5-1-102ol113Bib" target="_blank">5-1-102(13)(B)(i)(b)</a></cite> and subsection (a) of this section, to include viable fetuses, thereby giving statutory protection to unborn children, and that it would be absurd to think that less protection would be provided under Arkansas law to children who suffered in utero injury, but nevertheless managed to be born.

      As originally codified, chapter 2 was not divided into subchapters. However, subsequent to the enactment of Acts 2003, No. 610, the Arkansas Code Revision Commission determined that, for codification purposes, it would be necessary to reorganize chapter 2. Accordingly, Acts 2003, No. 610, §§ 1-19, were codified as new subchapter 2. Newly designated subchapter 1 was listed as a repealed subchapter.

      Except to the extent a fiduciary's right to disclaim is expressly restricted or limited by another statute of this State or by the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, a fiduciary may disclaim, in whole or part, any interest in or power over property, including a power of appointment, whether acting in a personal or representative capacity. A fiduciary may disclaim the interest or power even if its creator imposed a spendthrift provision or similar restriction on transfer or a restriction or limitation on the right to disclaim, or an instrument other than the instrument that created the fiduciary relationship imposed a restriction or limitation on the right to disclaim.

   Except for a disclaimer governed by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-207" target="_self">28-2-207</a></cite> or §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-208" target="_self">28-2-208</a></cite>, the following rules apply to a disclaimer of an interest in property:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The disclaimer takes effect as of the time the instrument creating the interest becomes irrevocable, or, if the interest arose under the law of intestate succession, as of the time of the intestate's death.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The disclaimed interest passes according to any provision in the instrument creating the interest providing for the disposition of the interest, should it be disclaimed, or of disclaimed interests in general.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If the instrument does not contain a provision described in subdivision (b)(2), the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      If the disclaimant is not an individual, the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant did not exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      If the disclaimant is an individual, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (b)(3)(C) and (D), the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant had died immediately before the time of distribution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      If by law or under the instrument, the descendants of the disclaimant would share in the disclaimed interest by any method of representation had the disclaimant died before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes only to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive the time of distribution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (D)
      </b>
      If the disclaimed interest would pass to the disclaimant's estate had the disclaimant died before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest instead passes by representation to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive the time of distribution. If no descendant of the disclaimant survives the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes to those persons, including the state but excluding the disclaimant, and in such shares as would succeed to the transferor's intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the transferor's domicile had the transferor died at the time of distribution. However, if the transferor's surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time of distribution, the transferor is deemed to have died unmarried at the time of distribution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      Upon the disclaimer of a preceding interest, a future interest held by a person other than the disclaimant takes effect as if the disclaimant had died or ceased to exist immediately before the time of distribution, but a future interest held by the disclaimant is not accelerated in possession or enjoyment.

   Where the four children of the intestate who were alive at his death and the five children of the decedent's son who had predeceased him had executed disclaimers of interest in the estate with the purpose of having certain property pass to his widow as the surviving spouse, but the other 12 grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren did not execute disclaimers, the property in question did not pass to the widow because under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c09s28-9-214" target="_self">28-9-214</a></cite> the estate would have passed to the widow only if there were no surviving descendants.

       The right of survivorship, where real property is held by the entirety, has not been abolished by this section, nor is the character of such estate changed by a divorce of the parties. Ward v. Ward, 186 Ark. 196, 53 S.W.2d 8 (1932).

      <p>
       Personal property acquired with the proceeds of land held by the entirety also constituted an estate by the entirety, and it was, therefore, appropriate for the farm equipment and livestock to pass to the surviving spouse by operation of law.

       Where father merely procured birth certificate for his illegitimate daughter at her request and signed it before a notary public but in no way indicated that he wished to make the daughter his heir, this was not sufficient to constitute a declaration in writing that he wished to make the daughter his heir.

Gordon, <cite class="us_code">430 U.S. 762</cite> (1977) found that a state's statutory prohibition of illegitimate children inheriting by intestate succession from their fathers while allowing legitimate children to inherit by intestate succession from both their fathers and mothers was constitutionally flawed under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause as discriminating against illegitimates where it excludes unnecessarily those categories of illegitimate children of intestate men for which inheritance rights can be recognized without jeopardizing the orderly settlement of estates or the dependability of titles to property passing under intestacy laws; that the Trimble decision, in effect, held that Arkansas Statute 61-141 (d) [see now §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c09s28-9-209" target="_self">28-9-209</a></cite>] as presently written is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause as discriminating against illegitimates in that it prohibits absolutely any inheritance from the father; that this Act is designed to bring the Arkansas law relating to the rights of an illegitimate child to inherit from the father into conformity with the decision of the Court in the Trimble case and should be given effect immediately. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

      Heirs will take per capita in the following circumstances:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)(A)
      </b>
      If all members of the class who inherit real or personal property from an intestate are related to the intestate in equal degree, they will inherit the intestate's estate in equal shares and will be said to take per capita.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      For illustration:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (i)
      </b>
      If the intestate leaves no heirs except children, the children will take per capita and in equal shares;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (ii)
      </b>
      If the intestate leaves no heirs except grandchildren, all the grandchildren will take per capita and in equal shares; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (iii)
      </b>
      If the inheriting class consists solely of great-grandchildren, or any more remote descendants of the intestate who are all related to the intestate in the same degree, they will take per capita.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      The same rule applies to the inheritance by collateral heirs of the intestate as when, for illustration, the inheriting class consists entirely of brothers and sisters, or consists solely of nieces and nephews who are descendants of deceased brothers and sisters, or consists of any other collateral relatives of the intestate who are related to the intestate in equal degree.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (D)
   
   Likewise, when the inheriting class consists of uncles, aunts, and grandparents or great-uncles, great-aunts, and great-grandparents who, under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c09s28-9-214" target="_self">28-9-214</a></cite>, may constitute an inheriting class even though they represent different generations, all members of such a class who survive the intestate will take per capita and share equally; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (2)
   
   If the members of the inheriting class are related to the intestate in unequal degree, those in the nearer degree will take per capita or in their own right, and those in the more remote degree will take per stirpes or through representation as provided in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c09s28-9-205" target="_self">28-9-205</a></cite>.

      An illegitimate child or his or her descendants may inherit real or personal property in the same manner as a legitimate child from the child's mother or her blood kindred. The child may inherit real or personal property from his or her father or from his or her father's blood kindred, provided that at least one (1) of the following conditions is satisfied and an action is commenced or claim asserted against the estate of the father in a court of competent jurisdiction within one hundred eighty (180) days of the death of the father:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      A court of competent jurisdiction has established the paternity of the child or has determined the legitimacy of the child pursuant to subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section;

       (3)
      </b>
      The man's name appears with his written consent on the birth certificate as the father of the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      The mother and father intermarry prior to the birth of the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      The mother and putative father attempted to marry each other prior to the birth of the child by a marriage solemnized in apparent compliance with law, although the attempted marriage is or could be declared invalid; or

       This section does not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. Amend. 14. Statutory differentiation based solely on illegitimacy can be justified by a state's interests in preventing spurious claims against intestate estates, and in the maintenance of a prompt and accurate method of distributing an intestate's property.

       Where a serviceman's life insurance policy named no beneficiary but stated that proceeds were to go first to a widow, second to a child, and third to his parents, the proceeds would go to his illegitimate child whose paternity he had acknowledged by affidavit filed in court. Cantrell v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 252 Ark. 70, 477 S.W.2d 484 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section giving an illegitimate child 180 days to file a claim creates a new right, and the right is created for only 180 days. State interests may justify the imposition of special requirements upon an illegitimate child who asserts a right to inherit from her father, and, of course, it justifies the enforcement of generally applicable limitations on the time and the manner in which claims may be asserted. Boatman v. Dawkins, 294 Ark. 421, 743 S.W.2d 800 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because there is no comma separating “illegitimate child” and the modifier “except such as would inherit under the law of descent and distribution” in the definition of child in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-102ol1a1" target="_self">28-1-102(a)(1)</a></cite>, the General Assembly intended for “except such as would inherit…” to modify only “illegitimate children.” McCoy v. Walker, 317 Ark. 86, 876 S.W.2d 252 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The heirs of the decedent were not estopped from invoking the requirement of subsection (d) of this section that the illegitimate son of the decedent commence an action against the decedent's estate within 180 days of the decedent's death, notwithstanding that the illegitimate son had been acknowledged by the decedent, that he was named as the decedent's son in his obituary, and that he was described as an heir in a deed. Rasberry v. Ivory, 67 Ark. App. 227, 998 S.W.2d 431 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Illegitimate child was awarded a share of his father's estate as a pretermitted heir under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-407ol1b" target="_self">28-39-407(b)</a></cite> where the wife waived an issue regarding competent jurisdiction by failing to object to a failure to join the estate in a paternity action; moreover, collateral estoppel applied because the wife appeared at the paternity proceeding, it was fully litigated, the necessary party issue was not raised, and no appeal was filed. Taylor v. Hamilton, 90 Ark. App. 235, 205 S.W.3d 149 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Time limitations in the nonclaim statute, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c50s28-50-101ol1a" target="_self">28-50-101(a)</a></cite>, do not apply to claims by illegitimate children under subsection (d) of this section; therefore, the trial court did not err by finding that an illegitimate son was a pretermitted heir. Taylor v. Hamilton, 90 Ark. App. 235, 205 S.W.3d 149 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in finding that one of the six conditions set out in subdivisions (d)(1)-(6) was required to be satisfied within 180 days from the death of the decedent; the alleged heir failed to commence an action or assert a claim pursuant to the statute. Burns v. Estate of Cole, 364 Ark. 280, 219 S.W.3d 134 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Decedent's illegitimate, pretermitted child was not entitled to inherit from decedent as he was required to meet requirements of §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-407ol1b" target="_self">28-39-407(b)</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-102ol1a1" target="_self">28-1-102(a)(1)</a></cite>, and the six requirements of subsection (d) of this section, but he failed to show that he had been recognized by the decedent or by a court and he failed to file his action within 180 days of decedent's death.
   Shelton v. Keathley, 367 Ark. 568, 242 S.W.3d 223 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under a plain reading of the language in this section, one of the six conditions must have been satisfied and an action commenced or a claim asserted against the estate prior to the expiration of the 180-day time period. Therefore, where a paternity case was not completed within the time period, a purported beneficiary failed to state a claim to recover from an estate as a pretermitted heir.
   Bell v. McDonald, 2014 Ark. 75, 432 S.W.3d 18 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in recognizing a son born out of wedlock as the decedent's sole heir because the son satisfied the written-acknowledgment condition in subsection (d) of this section; a beneficiary-designation form depicted that the decedent clearly wrote “son” and provided the son's proper name, Social Security number, date of birth, address, phone number, and gender on the form, and the 180-day limit was satisfied because the form was completed before decedent's death.
   Noble v. Neal, 2019 Ark. App. 86, 572 S.W.3d 40 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court's establishment of paternity is the particular statutory condition that must be met within 180 days following decedent's death; a decedent's acknowledgment must have been accomplished before the decedent's death, allowing a child born out of wedlock 180 days following a putative father's death to make a claim based on the decedent's written acknowledgment.

      <p>
       A parent's testimony is incompetent when it is employed to bastardize a child, which is presumed legitimate by one of the strongest presumptions found in the law. Bankston v. Prime W. Corp., 271 Ark. 727, 610 S.W.2d 586 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a statutory presumption that a child born during a marriage is the legitimate child of both spouses. The longstanding common law rule is that the declarations of a father or mother, cannot be admitted to bastardize the issue born after marriage. Lakey v. Lakey, 18 Ark. App. 182, 712 S.W.2d 663 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of legitimacy of a child conceived, but not born, during marriage, is rebuttable. Willmon v. Hunter, 297 Ark. 358, 761 S.W.2d 924 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A child is considered legitimate if the parents were married at the time of its conception and before its birth, even though they were not married to each other at the time the child was born. Willmon v. Hunter, 297 Ark. 358, 761 S.W.2d 924 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not against the public policy of this state to allow a third party to attempt to illegitimize a child which was conceived, but not born, during marriage. Willmon v. Hunter, 297 Ark. 358, 761 S.W.2d 924 (1988).

      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit to determine the distribution of proceeds of an insurance policy, it was not error to introduce an affidavit made by the deceased in a bastardy suit after being advised by an attorney, acknowledging that he was the father of the illegitimate child. Cantrell v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 252 Ark. 70, 477 S.W.2d 484 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the proof as a whole indicated that the decedent, upon a number of occasions, had acknowledged the petitioner as being his son, the trial court's finding to the contrary was reversible error. Christman v. Jones, 254 Ark. 936, 497 S.W.2d 14 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where in an action partitioning a decedent's estate, some putative heirs of the decedent sought a share of the proceeds when the land was partitioned, the evidence presented did not support their claim through their mother who allegedly was a daughter of the decedent, since the putative heirs did not prove that the decedent even knew their mother's mother some 26 years before he married her or that he fathered her child, the putative heirs' mother, when he was 15 and she was only 13 years of age. Ford v. King, 268 Ark. 128, 594 S.W.2d 227 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       In probate proceeding which occurred after subsection (d) of this section was declared unconstitutional, but prior to 1979 amendment of the subsection, determination that woman was illegitimate daughter of decedent was properly made from clear, cogent, and convincing proof rather than written acknowledgment of the putative father or a judicial determination during the lifetime of the parties. Lewis v. Petty, 272 Ark. 250, 613 S.W.2d 585 (1981).

       (a)(1)
      </b>
      In computing the degrees of relationship between any two (2) kinsmen who are not related in a direct line of ascent or descent, it is proper to start with the common ancestor of the kinsmen and count downwards. In whatever degree the kinsmen or the more remote of them is distant from the common ancestor, that is the degree in which they are related to each other.

     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Thus two (2) or more children of a common parent are related to each other in the first degree, because from the common parent to each of the children is counted only one (1) degree.

     <p>
      <b>
       (3)

     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      A person and his or her second cousin are related in the third degree, for they are both three (3) degrees removed from the great-grandparent who is their common ancestor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      In computing the degrees of relationship between any two (2) kinsmen related in a direct line of ascent or descent, the degree of relationship shall be determined by starting with one (1) of the persons and counting up or down to the other. Thus, a person and his or her:

   Seventh, if the intestate is survived by no descendant, then in respect to the portion of his or her estate as does not pass under subdivisions (2)-(6) of this section, the inheriting class will be the surviving great-grandparents and great-uncles and great-aunts of the intestate. In this situation, each surviving great-grandparent shall take the same share as each surviving great-uncle and great-aunt, and no distinction shall be made between the paternal and maternal sides. In other words, a maternal great-grandparent, great-uncle, or great-aunt shall take the same share as a paternal great-grandparent, great-uncle, or great-aunt and vice versa.

       In a suit to contest a will, where no evidence was shown and no contention was made that the divorce and remarriage intervened between the time of marriage and the death of husband, the court was right in refusing to hear that the widow had abandoned her marriage with the decedent and thus was not “continuously married.” Mabry v.

       The distinction between ancestral estates and new acquisitions in the devolution of property by intestacy was abolished in Arkansas by Acts 1969, No. 303 and has not been reinstated. Accordingly, where a decedent died intestate and without descendants in 1982, the decedent's property, which consisted principally of lands that were formerly owned by her late father, all went to her surviving husband, to whom she had been married for 53 years.

       The distinction between ancestral estates and new acquisitions in the devolution of property by intestacy was abolished in Arkansas by Acts 1969, No. 303 and has not been reinstated. Accordingly, where a decedent died intestate and without descendants in 1982, the decedent's property, which consisted principally of lands that were formerly owned by her late father, all went to her surviving husband. Heath v. Clear, 280 Ark. 482, 659 S.W.2d 504 (1983).

      This subchapter was repealed by Acts 2005, No. 74, § 3, effective January 1, 2006. The subchapter was derived from the following sources:
     </p>
     <p>
      28-10-101. Acts 1941, No. 15, § 1; A.S.A. 1947, § 61-124.

     <p>
      28-10-102. Acts 1941, No. 15, § 2; 1959, No. 203, § 1; A.S.A. 1947, § 61-125.

     </p>
     <p>
      28-10-104. This was originally a reserved section, because Section 4 of the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act (U.L.A.), which provides for the distribution of community property, was not enacted by Acts 1941, No. 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      28-10-105. Acts 1941, No. 15, § 4; A.S.A. 1947, § 61-127.
     </p>
     <p>
      28-10-106. Acts 1941, No. 15, § 5; A.S.A. 1947, § 61-127n.
     </p>
     <p>
      28-10-107. Acts 1941, No. 15, § 6; 1959, No. 203, § 3; A.S.A. 1947, § 61-128.
     </p>
     <p>
      28-10-108. Acts 1941, No. 15, § 7; A.S.A. 1947, § 61-129.

     </p>
     <p>
      28-10-112. This was originally a reserved section, because Section 11 of the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act (U.L.A.), which is an effective date provision, was not enacted by Acts 1941, No. 15.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the rules of evidence in courts of general jurisdiction, the following rules relating to a determination of death and status apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      Death occurs when an individual has sustained either: (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem. A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      A certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate purporting to be issued by an official or agency of the place where the death purportedly occurred is prima facie evidence of the fact, place, date, and time of death and the identity of the decedent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      A certified or authenticated copy of any record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that an individual is missing, detained, dead, or alive is prima facie evidence of the status and of the dates, circumstances, and places disclosed by the record or report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      In the absence of prima facie evidence of death under paragraph (2) or (3), the fact of death may be established by clear and convincing evidence, including circumstantial evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      An individual whose death is not established under the preceding paragraphs who is absent for a continuous period of five years, during which he or she has not been heard from, and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search or inquiry, is presumed to be dead. His or her death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      In the absence of evidence disputing the time of death stipulated on a document described in paragraph (2) or (3), a document described in paragraph (2) or (3) that stipulates a time of death 120 hours or more after the time of death of another individual, however the time of death of the other individual is determined, establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the other individual by 120 hours.

       (a)(1)
      </b>
      A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a person designated in a governing instrument who, under this subchapter, is not entitled to the payment or item of property, or for having taken any other action in good faith reliance on the person's apparent entitlement under the terms of the governing instrument, before the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this subchapter. A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this subchapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under paragraph 1 must be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Upon receipt of written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this subchapter, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents' estates located in the county of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the funds or item of property and, upon its determination under this subchapter, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)(1)
      </b>
      A person who purchases property for value and without notice, or who receives a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation, is neither obligated under this subchapter to return the payment, item of property, or benefit nor liable under this subchapter for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. But a person who, not for value, receives a payment, item of property, or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this subchapter is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this subchapter.

        Applicability.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section was intended to apply only to dower and curtesy and does not apply to a widow's claim for statutory allowance where she is convicted of the murder of her husband. However, apart from this section, the principle that one who wrongfully kills another will not be permitted to share in the other's estate or otherwise profit from the crime will apply to such a situation. Smith v. Dean, 226 Ark. 438, 290 S.W.2d 439 (1956), overruled, Zinger v. Terrell, 336 Ark. 423, 985 S.W.2d 737 (Ark. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was not applicable where the insured and his beneficiary wife were found together dead of gunshot wounds without evidence as to who died first or that the insured had killed his wife and then committed suicide. Belt v. Baser, 238 Ark. 644, 383 S.W.2d 657 (1964).

      <p>
       Where the husband was living with his wife at the time of her death and there is no evidence either that he had anything to do with the death of his wife or that he had abandoned her, a court commits error in holding that the husband forfeited his right of curtesy in his wife's estate. Phipps v. Wilson, 251 Ark. 377, 472 S.W.2d 929 (1971).

       Where a wife committed suicide shortly after killing her husband and consequently was not tried or convicted, this section did not exclude her heirs from asserting dower in her husband's property. Barnes v. Cooper, 204 Ark. 118, 161 S.W.2d 8 (1942).

      </h4>
      <p>
       One who wrongfully kills another is not permitted to profit by the crime; the purpose underlying this general rule is to deter such conduct. However, the rule is inapplicable where the wrongdoer stands to gain nothing by his actions, as where he kills himself too. Luecke v. Mercantile Bank, 286 Ark. 304, 691 S.W.2d 843 (1985).

   The operation of the dower provisions under subsection (b) of this section, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-201" target="_self">28-11-201</a></cite>, and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-307" target="_self">28-11-307</a></cite> which gave the wife the right of dower which could not be defeated by a husband's conveyance and the comparable curtesy statutes under former §§ 61-228 (repealed) and 61-229 (repealed) which allowed the wife to defeat curtesy by conveyance provided for dissimilar treatment for men and women similarly situated and there was no justification for the discrimination. Hess v. Wims, 272 Ark. 43, 613 S.W.2d 85 (1981) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) of this section which was gender based and did not serve an important governmental function was held unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981), overruled in part, Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983); Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) of this section, which gave a wife a dower interest in property which her husband may have disposed of during the marriage without her consent, but did not give the husband equal rights to her property, was a gender based statute which did not serve an important governmental function and thus was unconstitutional since it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981), overruled in part, Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decedent died intestate, widow's claim of dower to a part of his real property under subsection (a) of this section was the exact equivalent of the rights of curtesy under former § 61-228 (repealed), which he could have enjoyed had he survived his wife; hence, there was no impingement of the equal protection clause, as there was no discrimination in favor of either sex where the deceased spouse died intestate. Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statement, in Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372, 18 A.L.R.4th 903 (1981), that subsection (a) of this section was unconstitutional was too broad and extended beyond the holding reached in Stokes, supra, which was that where a husband died testate the wife could not take dower against the will, there being no concomitant benefit given to husbands under the law the statement should have been qualified by the provisional wording that the statute was unconstitutional “as applied in this case.” Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dower and curtesy statutes, as they existed prior to 1981 amendments, were valid in cases of intestacy because there was no difference between the dower of a surviving wife and the curtesy of a surviving husband. Dent v. Rose, 281 Ark. 42, 661 S.W.2d 361 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).

      </p>
      <p>
       Inchoate dower interest held by defendant's wife in non-homestead property did not preclude a finding that defendant could have obtained enough funds from sale of the property to pay legal fees in a criminal case; defendant was therefore required to reimburse the government for legal services provided under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C.S. § 3006A.

       Ruling in favor of a corporation that the decedent's wife did not hold title to the land or mineral rights at issue was proper because she possessed only a dower interest at the time of the 1986 deed under subsection (a) of this section and the after-acquired title doctrine barred her from asserting a claim to the property. At most, she had only a dower interest in the oil, gas, and mineral rights reserved by her husband in the 1986 deed and even if the deed had specifically limited her conveyance to her actual interest at the time, that interest was inchoate when the deed was executed.

        Nature of Dower.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A widow has dower for life of one-third of the real estate owned by her husband at any time during coverture, whether unsold at his death or sold or alienated by him without her consent in legal form, and one-third of all personal estate owned by him at his death, including money or cash on hand and choses in action, absolutely, unless he leaves no children, in which case her interest is one-half of each part instead of one-third. And this dower in each part she takes by way of a lien, created by and at the time of marriage, and paramount to creditors and purchasers, and without any regard to his debts. Her dower in each part is carved out of the specific estate of which he was possessed; and, if she has been deprived of it, she can follow it wherever it may be found, and subject it to her lien, unless by her own laches, she has abandoned or waived the right. Hill's Adm'rs v. Mitchell, 5 Ark. (5 Pike) 608 (1844).
      </p>
      <p>
       While dower remains unascertained, and until there has been an actual admeasurement by metes and bounds, it is a mere potential interest, amounting to nothing more than a chose in action, and is not subject to seizure and sale by execution at law. Pennington v. Yell, 11 Ark. 212 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       A widow takes dower under law existing at husband's death. Hatcher v. Buford, 60 Ark. 169, 29 S.W. 641 (1895); Sanders v. Taylor, 193 Ark. 1095, 104 S.W.2d 797 (1937).

       A widow does not hold as heir of her husband her dower interest in his lands. Barton v. Wilson, 116 Ark. 400, 172 S.W. 1032 (Ark. 1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature may change or abolish the inchoate right of dower, it being not a vested right. Skelly Oil Co. v. Murphy, 180 Ark. 1023, 24 S.W.2d 314 (1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Until her husband's death a wife's right of dower is inchoate, that is, it is contingent upon his death during her lifetime. It is not an interest in her husband's property as may be conveyed by her and may only be relinquished by her to her husband's grantee in the manner and form as provided by statute. Le Croy v. Cook, 211 Ark. 966, 204 S.W.2d 173 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       A widow's dower is not an estate in itself but, when assigned, it becomes a life estate in the lands assigned, prior to which it has attached to nothing, although it is a right vested in the widow. Bradham v. United States, 287 F. Supp. 10 (W.D. Ark. 1968).

       This section, which gave a widow a dower interest in property which was mortgaged by her husband before the mortgage, but did not give this right to the husband, was gender based and served no important governmental function; thus, it was held unconstitutional since it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981), overruled in part, Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).

       This section, which allowed a widow to take dower in bonds, bills, notes, books, accounts, and evidence of debt which her husband owned at the time of his death, but did not contain a similar provision for the husband, was a gender based statute which had no important governmental function and thus violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981), overruled in part, Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment). But see Beck v.

   The statement, in Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372, 18 A.L.R.4th 903 (1981), that §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-301" target="_self">28-11-301</a></cite> was unconstitutional was too broad and extended beyond the holding reached in Stokes, supra, which was that where a husband died testate the wife could not take dower against the will, there being no concomitant benefit given to husbands under the law; the statement should have been qualified by the provisional wording that the statute was unconstitutional “as applied in this case.” Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).

   Prior to enactment of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-306" target="_self">28-11-306</a></cite>, it was held that a widow was not entitled to dower in the choses in action of her deceased husband.

      </p>
      <p>
       Rejection of the husband's claim that he had a curtesy interest in a settlement award involving his deceased wife was appropriate because the wife never possessed a chose in action since there was no cause of action for wrongful death created in any individual beneficiary under the wrongful-death statute. The circuit court found that she was possessed of a chose in action, which was incorrect as a matter of law; nevertheless, the circuit court reached the right result in denying the husband's claim under the dower and curtesy statute.

       Bankruptcy debtor husband had no curtesy interest to exempt in stock owned by the co-debtor wife on the bankruptcy petition date since the wife, as the sole legal owner, was still living, and the husband's curtesy right had not yet accrued and did not become property of the husband's estate on the filing of the bankruptcy petition.

       Where a husband died leaving a policy of war risk insurance, one-fourth of which was payable to his mother in instalments as long as she lived and at her death the balance, if any, was to go to his estate, it was held that, on the mother's death, the value of the unpaid instalment which would have been paid to her if she had lived and which reverted to his estate was such an estate as entitled the widow of the insured to a dower interest therein.

       This section, which allowed a widow to take dower in bonds, bills, notes, books, accounts, and evidence of debt which her husband owned at the time of his death, but did not contain a similar provision for the husband, was a gender based statute which had no important governmental function and thus violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981), overruled in part, Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision under prior law).

     <p>
      Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple owners of a security registered in beneficiary form hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entireties, or as owners of community property held in survivorship form, and not as tenants in common.

     <p>
      A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity's principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the owner's address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or similar legislation is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

     <p>
      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

Const. Amend. 80, § 6, and the fact that, under the Uniform Transfer on Death Security Registration Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c14s28-14-101" target="_self">28-14-101</a></cite> et seq., the money transferred from the TOD account did not become part of the estate, the circuit court clearly had jurisdiction.

       Administratrix, wife of the decedent, who sought to divorce the decedent but reconciled shortly before the decedent's death, convinced the trial court the monies in a transfer-on-death account (TOD account) naming children from the decedent's former marriage as the beneficiaries was a fraudulent transfer; if the TOD account was owned by both the decedent and the administratrix, the administratrix could claim dower rights in the property, but decedent's children presented compelling facts that the account was separate property owned by the decedent, and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the administratrix.

      A registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form. If a registration in beneficiary form is offered by a registering entity, the owner requesting registration in beneficiary form assents to the protections given to the registering entity by this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      By accepting a request for registration of a security in beneficiary form, the registering entity agrees that the registration will be implemented on death of the deceased owner as provided in this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (c)
   
   A registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs, or devisees of a deceased owner if it registers a transfer of the security in accordance with §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c14s28-14-107" target="_self">28-14-107</a></cite> and does so in good faith reliance (i) on the registration, (ii) on this chapter, and (iii) on information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiary's representatives, or other information available to the registering entity. The protections of this chapter do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a registering entity has received written notice from any claimant to any interest in the security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form. No other notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      The protection provided by this chapter to the registering entity of a security does not affect the rights of beneficiaries in disputes between themselves and other claimants to ownership of the security transferred or its value or proceeds.

       (a)
      </b>
      A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests (i) for registrations in beneficiary form, and (ii) for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for “lineal descendants per stirpes.” This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.

       Contract to make a will not shown where the 1976 wills permitted discretionary disposition of personal property, did not contain words like “agreement to make mutual wills” or “agreeing that the survivor leaves his property to the heirs listed,” and the other evidence presented was not clear, cogent, and convincing of the existence of such a contract.

       The chancellor's decision that there was no valid contract to make the appellant a beneficiary of the decedent's will was not clearly erroneous, notwithstanding testimony that after the decedent made the appellant the beneficiary of his will in October 1996, she agreed to keep house for him, cook his meals and take care of him, since neither that 1996 will nor the 1997 will at issue contained a statement of the material provisions of a contract between the decedent and the appellant and neither will contained an express reference to a contract between them.

       Circuit court did not clearly err in finding that there was no contractual agreement between a husband and wife to make their trusts irrevocable where there was no writing to that effect, both husband and wife reserved the right to amend, modify, or revoke the trusts in whole or in part at any time, and the only evidence supporting the contention that the husband executed an irrevocable trust came from witnesses related to the wife.

       Although at the time of the execution of a will a statute provided that a woman under age 21 had no power to execute a will conveying real property, will executed by executor when she was only 18 years old was valid and properly probated where, prior to her death, the statute was changed to provide validity for wills of persons of 18 years of age who were in their right mind.

       The capacity to make a will is of such a degree of reason and judgment as to enable the party to comprehend the subject. Kelly's Heirs v. McGuire, 15 Ark. 555 (1855); Abraham v. Wilkins, 17 Ark. 292 (1856) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The capacity to make a will is such as requires sufficient mind to contract, free from such undue influences as constrain the party to act against his will or subdue the will until it ceases to act for itself and acts under the dictates of the will of another. Tobin v. Jenkins, 29 Ark. 151 (1874) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The test of testamentary capacity is that the testator shall have the capacity to retain in memory, without prompting, the extent and condition of his property, to comprehend to whom he is giving it, and to appreciate the desserts and relation to him of others whom he excludes from participation in his estate. Taylor v. McClintock, 87 Ark. 243, 112 S.W. 405 (1908) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error, in a will contest, to instruct the jury that a testator in order to be capable of making a will must have “a full knowledge of the property he possesses”; rather, the true test with respect to his property was not whether he knew, but whether he was mentally capable of knowing, what property he possessed. Huffaker v. Beers, 95 Ark. 158, 128 S.W. 1040 (1910) (decision under prior law).

       The purpose of the law relating to the execution of wills is to protect testamentary conveyances against fraud and deception and not to impede them by technicalities. Hanel v. Springle, 237 Ark. 356, 372 S.W.2d 822 (1963).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The requirements for establishing an attested will must be read together and construed to permit establishment of the will by any legally admissible evidence or requisite facts in order that the testatrix's wishes may not be thwarted by straightlaced construction of statutory language where there is no indication of fraud, deception, imposition, or undue influence. Green v. Holland, 9 Ark. App. 233, 657 S.W.2d 572 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is no indication of fraud, deception, undue influence, or imposition, a court may avoid a strict technical construction of the statutory requirements in order to give effect to the testator's wishes. Faith v. Singleton, 286 Ark. 403, 692 S.W.2d 239 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is mandatory in order to validate a nonholographic will. Shamoon v. Tombridge, 291 Ark. 222, 723 S.W.2d 827 (1987).

        Acknowledgment by Testator.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Testator's statement to attesting witness that the instrument was his will raises presumption, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that testator's signature was on the will and it was an acknowledgment to testator's subscription to the will in compliance with statutory requirements. Anthony v. College of Ozarks, 207 Ark. 212, 180 S.W.2d 321 (1944), superseded by statute as stated in, In re Estate of Sharp, 306 Ark. 268, 810 S.W.2d 952 (Ark. 1991) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       If, without referring to instrument as his will, testator produces it with his signature visible, and requests witness to sign it, this is a sufficient acknowledgment. Anthony v. College of Ozarks, 207 Ark. 212, 180 S.W.2d 321 (1944), superseded by statute as stated in, In re Estate of Sharp, 306 Ark. 268, 810 S.W.2d 952 (Ark. 1991) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Testator may acknowledge his signature by his acts and gestures, without making any express acknowledgment of the signature in words. Anthony v. College of Ozarks, 207 Ark. 212, 180 S.W.2d 321 (1944), superseded by statute as stated in, In re Estate of Sharp, 306 Ark. 268, 810 S.W.2d 952 (Ark. 1991) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of publication can be inferred from all of the circumstances attending the execution of the will; a testator may acknowledge his signature by acts and gestures without expressing it in words. Green v. Holland, 9 Ark. App. 233, 657 S.W.2d 572 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the signing of a will is proven by two attesting witnesses, and there is no suggestion of fraud or undue influence, there is a presumption that the testator declared to the attesting witnesses that the instrument was his will; and that he either signed in front of them or acknowledged to them his signature on the instrument; and that the attesting witnesses signed at the request of and in the presence of the testator. In re Estate of Sharp, 306 Ark. 268, 810 S.W.2d 952 (Ark. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in finding substantial compliance with the requirement of declaring one's will to the witnesses where, even had the decedent not declared to one of the witnesses that it was her last will and testament, nor had she specifically asked either witness to sign it, the witness was standing by as the handwritten document was read back to the decedent, and the witness understood the document to have been the decedent's last will and testament. Fischer v. Kinzalow, 88 Ark. App. 307, 198 S.W.3d 555 (2004).

        Attestation by Witnesses.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Previously it was held that it was not necessary that witnesses to a will subscribe in the presence, actual or constructive, of the testator. Abraham v. Wilkins, 17 Ark. 292 (1856) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       An attesting witness to a will may subscribe by mark, although the person who writes the name fails to sign his name as a witness in fact. Davis v. Semmes, 51 Ark. 48, 9 S.W. 434 (1888) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will was duly executed where it was subscribed in the presence of one attesting witness and then taken by the testator to a justice of the peace to whom he pointed out his signature, declared the writing to be his will, and procured the justice to sign and certify the will in his official capacity. The certificate, though superfluous, did not vitiate the attestation by the justice. Payne v. Payne, 54 Ark. 415, 16 S.W. 1 (1891) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will cannot be admitted to probate where the signature of the testator is attested by only one witness. Johnson v. Hinton, 130 Ark. 394, 197 S.W. 706 (1917) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will signed by a mark in the presence of justice of peace who did not write his own name as witness and by two witnesses out of the presence of the testator and not at her request was held invalid. Graves v. Bowles, 193 Ark. 546, 101 S.W.2d 176 (1937) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will signed by one witness who was a total stranger to testator and to other witness several days after it was executed by testator and signed by the other witness was rejected as not having been properly attested. Hendry v. Wilson, 202 Ark. 580, 151 S.W.2d 683 (1941) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an attestation is dated one month earlier than a will, the will is still valid if there is no dispute that the will was signed by the testator and attested by the witnesses on the same date. Miller v. Mitchell, 224 Ark. 585, 275 S.W.2d 3 (1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       There has never been any requirement in Arkansas that the two witnesses to a will sign in the presence of each other, and this section has not changed the law in that respect. Coleman v. Walls, 241 Ark. 842, 410 S.W.2d 749 (1967); Upton v. Upton, 26 Ark. App. 78, 759 S.W.2d 811 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the will probably qualified as a holographic will, since it was signed at the end by the testator, in the presence of two attesting witnesses as required by this section, the evidence was sufficient to establish the will as an attested will. Walpole v. Lewis, 254 Ark. 89, 492 S.W.2d 410 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the testator signs his will with an “X”, this section requires a minimum of three subscribing witnesses to make the will in question valid. Shamoon v. Tombridge, 291 Ark. 222, 723 S.W.2d 827 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory formalities specifically required the testatrix, who signed by a mark, to have a witness who signed the document attesting to her mark and two attesting witnesses to sign at end of the instrument to constitute a validly executed will; although three witnesses attested to the execution of the will, the will did not refer to any witness as being a special witness to the mark, and therefore, the will was invalid because the writing of the testatrix's name by the witness to the mark was not done in the presence of two attesting witnesses. Smith v. Wharton, 349 Ark. 351, 78 S.W.3d 79 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Witness was within the range of the testator's senses while in an adjacent room with the door open to the testatrix's bedroom; thus, he was in the presence of the testator at the time he subscribed his name to the testatrix's will. Conner v. Donahoo, 85 Ark. App. 43, 145 S.W.3d 395 (2004).

Coleman v. Walls, 241 Ark. 842, 410 S.W.2d 749 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will signed by blind person by mark with assistance from the sole beneficiary and witnessed by two other people is valid. Patrick v. Rankin, 256 Ark. 310, 506 S.W.2d 853 (1974).

       Production of a written paper purporting to be the will of a deceased person which is rational on its face, and which is proved to have been executed and witnessed in accordance with statutory requirements makes a prima facie case and devolves upon the contestants the onus of showing the testator's incompetency. Gray v. Fulton, 205 Ark. 675, 170 S.W.2d 384 (1943) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       When surviving son offered the will for probate, he had the burden of proving the genuineness of the signatures. Where he made such proof and the will was admitted to probate, the appellants who sought to contest the will within the six-month period had the burden of sustaining the contest on the alleged ground that the signatures to the will were a forgery. Ross v. Edwards, 231 Ark. 902, 333 S.W.2d 487 (1960).

       Where a written instrument was executed as a will but only one witness signed it and the instrument, along with two letters written by the deceased to his wife, was offered for probate on the ground that purported typewritten will became part of a valid will when coupled with the letters written by the deceased in his own handwriting to his wife, court erred in overruling demurrer to petition to probate where there was no evidence whatever to the effect that he intended that either the letter should constitute a will or that it be used in connection with any other document or instrument so as to constitute a will. Smith v. Nelson, 227 Ark. 512, 299 S.W.2d 645 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that deceased specifically request the witnesses to sign his will. Thus where a deceased's actions showed that he knew he was making a will, that he was asked if he wanted any of his property to go to a certain person and he explained why he did not, and that he signed the instrument in front of the witnesses and permitted them to sign as witnesses, the statutory provisions were substantially complied with. Hanel v. Springle, 237 Ark. 356, 372 S.W.2d 822 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a document sets forth no words of a dispositive nature, it is defective on its face because it lacks the required intent to make a will, and extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove the necessary intent. Dunn v. Means, 304 Ark. 473, 803 S.W.2d 542 (1991).

       Where a testator's name is signed to a will by his direction and he does nothing more thereby adopting such signature as his subscription, the person so signing for the testator must also write his own name as a witness and state that he signed the testator's name at his request. Statutory provisions did not apply, however, where the testator signed himself by making his mark. In re Will of Cornelius, 14 Ark. 675 (1854); Guthrie v.

       Although no presumption of due execution of a will arises from the mere production of an instrument purporting to be a will, if it appears to have been duly executed and the attestation is established by the witnesses to its execution, although they do not remember the transaction, it will be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the will was executed in compliance with the requirements of law including those as to attestation in the presence of the testator and affixing the testator's signature prior to those of the witnesses. Green v. Holland, 9 Ark. App. 233, 657 S.W.2d 572 (1983); Upton v. Upton, 26 Ark. App. 78, 759 S.W.2d 811 (1988).

       Execution of a will may be sufficiently proved where one witness testifies positively to the requisites of execution, though another does not recall some of the requisites, especially where testimony is given several years after execution of the will.

       No presumption of due execution arises from mere production of an instrument purporting to be a last will and testament, but where the instrument appears to have been duly executed as a will, and the attestation is established by proof of the handwriting of the witnesses or otherwise, although their testimony is not available, or they do not remember the transaction, it will be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the will was executed in compliance with all the requirements of law. Anthony v. College of Ozarks, 207 Ark. 212, 180 S.W.2d 321 (1944), superseded by statute as stated in, In re Estate of Sharp, 306 Ark. 268, 810 S.W.2d 952 (Ark. 1991) (decision under prior law).

       Each of the attesting witnesses must sign his name as a witness at the request of the testator; however, such a request may be inferred from the attendant circumstances, by signs, or by gestures, as well as words, as by the testator desiring the witness to be sent for to attest the execution of the will or from a request made to such witnesses by another person in the presence of the testator.

       Will was signed by testator and duly witnessed according to law where testimony by witnesses showed that testator requested witnesses for her will and duly signed the will in their presence and that witnesses then signed the will as witnesses in presence of testator.

       Where the testator and both attesting witnesses were dead, all the contestants had to do was to prove that any one of the three signatures was a forgery in order to defeat probate since a valid will, other than a holographic one, must have two witnesses. Ross v. Edwards, 231 Ark. 902, 333 S.W.2d 487 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is essential to due execution of a will that it be signed or subscribed by the number of witnesses required by law governing the particular will being made, and subscription by fewer renders the transaction a nullity. Ash v. Morgan, 232 Ark. 602, 339 S.W.2d 309 (1960).

      <p>
       While substantial compliance with the procedure in subdivision (b)(5) of this section has been held sufficient in some situations, it has never been extended to allow a witness to attest a will before the testator signs it and who in fact never sees the testator sign.

      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the requirement that subscription be at end of a will is to prevent fraud. Weems v. Smith, 218 Ark. 554, 237 S.W.2d 880 (1951) (decision under prior law).

       The signature of the testator at the end of a holographic will is not requisite to its validity. Smith v. MacDonald, 252 Ark. 931, 481 S.W.2d 741 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the testator places his signature in the attestation clause because he believes that it belongs there and with the requisite testamentary intent, it constitutes a sufficient compliance with this section requiring the signature to be at the end.

       When a testator presents a will to a witness, the presumption is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the testator's signature is on the will; where there is clear evidence to the contrary, no presumption is permissible. Burns v. Adamson, 313 Ark. 281, 854 S.W.2d 723 (1993).

       Where a will is signed by testator's mark, it is mandatory that a minimum of three signatures be attached, one to witness the testator's mark and two to attest the will. Green v. Smith, 236 Ark. 829, 368 S.W.2d 280 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will is signed by testator's mark, the mark must be witnessed by the signature of the party who wrote the testator's name and the signatures of two attending witnesses. Green v. Smith, 236 Ark. 829, 368 S.W.2d 280 (1963).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where testator made an “X” on his will and the drafting attorney then wrote testator's name next to the mark, after which two other witnesses signed the will as witnesses, the will was properly executed, since this section does not require that the person who writes the name of the testator near his mark must also sign as a witness to the signature or as a witness to the will itself.

       Where a testator signed a will by his mark and the party who signed his name failed to attest the signature by writing his own name as witness, an ex parte affidavit by the witness that he wrote the deceased's name for him and witnessed the making of his mark by the deceased is inadmissible; there then being no proof of the deceased's signature, the will is not entitled to probate.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the record shows that the witnesses understood the paper signed was the will of testator and that he expected and desired them to sign as witnesses, and testator signed will in their presence and they signed as witnesses in the presence of the testator, there was substantial compliance with this section, although the witnesses could not say positively that testator actually said it was his will or that he literally requested them to sign it as witnesses. Hollingsworth v. Hollingsworth, 240 Ark. 582, 401 S.W.2d 555 (1966).

      <p>
       Where both witnesses to the execution of a will were unable to definitely testify that they saw the testator sign the will, but one witness testified that he did not believe that he would have signed the attestation clause unless decedent had signed the will in his presence and the other witness testified that he was “pretty sure” that he had seen decedent sign his name, the will was validly executed under this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where testator went to attorney's office for the specific purpose of making a will and did so and no one questioned the genuineness of her signature and where attorney's secretary and a client witnessed the will, trial court's determination that will was validly executed was not clearly erroneous even though witnesses could not specifically recall seeing testator sign the will. Green v. Holland, 9 Ark. App. 233, 657 S.W.2d 572 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Will which disinherited a party was valid because all of the elements of proper execution were met under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Also, testamentary capacity was present because when the will was executed the testatrix comprehended the nature and extent of her property and to whom she was giving it.

       When evidence supported finding that a holographic will was executed within a fairly short time prior to death of decedent who knew he had a serious coronary condition, it was sufficient to establish that will was testamentary in character and executed with testamentary intent. Chambers v. Younes, 240 Ark. 428, 399 S.W.2d 655 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       An alleged holographic will consisting of a sketch on the back of a used envelope and setting forth no words of a dispositive nature was defective on its face because it lacked the required animus testandi, and thus extrinsic evidence was not admissible to prove the necessary intent. McDonald v. Petty, 262 Ark. 517, 559 S.W.2d 1 (1977).

       Written and signed instrument addressed to specified church and containing language that “being of sound mind I give to this church for the purpose of educating youth to Christ all my possessions to be disposed or used as the Board of Stewards and the Minister sees fit” was testamentary in character and entitled to be admitted to probate as a holographic will.

       Probate court erred when it refused to admit a holographic will into probate; although the will did not contain specific testamentary language, the decedent's testamentary intent in the document was shown by the fact that it was captioned “Last Will,” the witnesses who signed the document believed it was a will, and the decedent had told her sister that she had a will. Edmondston v. Estate of Fountain, 84 Ark. App. 231, 137 S.W.3d 415 (2003), rev'd, Edmundson v. Estate of Fountain, 358 Ark. 302, 189 S.W.3d 427 (2004).

       Judge's handwritten will, which was undated and contained blanks in the attestation clause, met the requirements of this section, which requires only that the entire body of the will be written in the testator's handwriting and signed; this section does not require a date or witnesses to attest execution. The four corners of the document demonstrated that the judge intended to make a testamentary disposition, as it was titled as a last will, it disposed of the judge's property, and was written entirely in the judge's own handwriting and signed at the bottom.

       Where testator's name is written in or upon some part of the will other than at the end thereof, in order to be a valid signature, it must be shown that the testator wrote his name where he did with the intention of authenticating or executing the instrument as his will.

       A witness to the handwriting and signature of an alleged testator is unimpeachable where there is no evidence reflecting on his character or testimony. Arendt v. Arendt, 80 Ark. 204, 96 S.W. 982 (1906); Smith v. Boswell, 93 Ark. 66, 124 S.W. 264 (1909) (decision under prior law).

      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to establish a lost holographic will, it is immaterial that the witnesses to the contents and handwriting are interested if there is no question that the document and signature were written by the testator.

       A credible witness to a holographic will is one who is competent and who is worthy of belief. Sanders v. Abernathy, 221 Ark. 407, 253 S.W.2d 351 (1952).
      </p>

       Trial court erred in denying probate of a holographic will on the ground that evidence presented did not meet requirements necessary to establish holographic will where four renters from deceased and two banking officials testified that will was in handwriting of the deceased.

       Trial court did not err in finding that the requirements of this section had been satisfied because two witnesses, in addition to the grandson who was challenging the codicil, professed sufficient knowledge about decedent's printing and testified that the codicil was written in what appeared to be decedent's handwriting.

       In order to effect revocation of a will other than by execution of another, the revocation must be in a manner prescribed by statute. Reiter v. Carroll, 210 Ark. 841, 198 S.W.2d 163 (1946) (decision under prior law).

      <p>

       A testator did not successfully alter her will by retyping all dispositive provisions in her will and destroying the original provisions, since the altered instrument was not reexecuted and reattested to. Tull v. Benton State Bank, 257 Ark. 386, 516 S.W.2d 583 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the testator changed the disposition of her property in her typewritten will by interlineation or obliteration of a devisee's name, her attempt to obliterate the name of the devisee was void since it was not attested, and the devisee's name had to be restored to the will as originally intended.

      <p>
       Prior to enactment of this section, the only methods of revoking a will were those provided by statute, and a divorce and property settlement to former wife were not facts sufficient to revoke a will. Mosely v. Mosely, 217 Ark. 536, 231 S.W.2d 99, 18 A.L.R.2d 695 (1950) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The divorced wife of a testator who took her share of their marital property in the divorce proceeding was estopped from taking advantage of this implied revocation statute after the testator's death to obtain the bulk of her former husband's remaining property on the ground that the marriage was void. Rickner v. Estate of Rickner, 283 Ark. 42, 670 S.W.2d 450 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Will was not revoked by testator's marriage, but divorce did revoke will provisions made in spouse's favor. Davis v. Aringe, 292 Ark. 549, 731 S.W.2d 210 (1987).

       Before a case can be made for equitable intervention, there must be proof that the testator undertook acts which would have resulted in legal revocation of the will had he not been prevented from the fulfillment of such acts by force or fraud.

       The clear meaning of the words used in this section is that any bequest to a former spouse is void but that the remainder of the will remains in effect. McGuire v. McGuire, 275 Ark. 432, 631 S.W.2d 12 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not provide that its provision revoking a former spouse's bequest or devise upon divorce is dependent upon testator having made his will during a marriage. Davis v. Aringe, 292 Ark. 549, 731 S.W.2d 210 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Revocation of a holographic will that provided that the decedent's estate would pass to his former wife was appropriate under subsection (b) of this section because the parties'
   divorce occurred after the execution of the decedent's holographic will and his bequest was revoked by operation of law.
   Langston v. Langston, 371 Ark. 404, 266 S.W.3d 716 (2007), rehearing denied, — Ark. —, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Ark. LEXIS 663 (Dec. 6, 2007).

      <p>
       An unattested holographic will held not to revoke a prior attested will. Parker v. Hill, 85 Ark. 363, 108 S.W. 208 (1908) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a holographic will, when found, had the word “void” written at the top of each page and cross marks through the provisions of each page and the testimony of witnesses disagreed as to whether the word “void” and the cross marks were in the testator's handwriting, finding of the probate court that the will had been intentionally and effectively revoked by the testator was not against the preponderance of the evidence. Starnes v. Andre, 243 Ark. 712, 421 S.W.2d 616 (1967).
      </p>

       Trial court clearly erred in finding that a note an executrix found was an effective change of a decedent's individual retirement account beneficiary because if the note was regarded as a holographic will, it was revoked by the express terms of the decedent's will and by operation of law pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of this section.

       Although this section permits revocation of all or part of a will by cancellation or obliteration by the testator with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the will, since the “strike outs” had the effect of increasing the estate, the attempted revocation was ineffective because it would have resulted in a new testamentary disposition without attestation.

       Where the widow testified she observed the testator tear up his will and set fire to it about a week before his death and where a witness testified that the testator the day before his death stated that he tore up his old will, there was substantial evidence to support the probate court's finding that the testator intentionally destroyed his will.

       Decedent's acts of marking “void” over each paragraph of his will, writing “bastard” and “get nothing” on the will, applying Liquid Paper over the names of the beneficiaries, and then shredding the document in the presence of his insurance agents, were sufficient to revoke the will under subdivision (a)(2) of this section. The proponents of the will failed to show that the decedent suffered from insane delusions at the time of the revocation.

       Where a husband executed a will giving all of his property to his wife with his stepchildren as the residual legatees and subsequently the parties were divorced, but the will was not changed, the bequest to his former spouse was thereby revoked in accordance with this section and the stepchildren were the proper parties to receive the property under the terms of the will.

      </p>
      <p>
       Residuary bequest to the decedent's stepchildren in the decedent's last will and testament was voided because the decedent's spouse, who was removed from the will pursuant to an antenuptial agreement, did not predecease the decedent by 30 days so that the condition precedent in the will that would have allowed the stepchildren to inherit under the terms of the will was not met. Further, the circuit court's determination that the antenuptial agreement did not cancel the entirety of the decedent's will was not clearly erroneous.

This section does not require a holding that §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-401" target="_self">28-39-401</a></cite> was not intended to be applied when the will predates a marriage.

       Where a will provided for a trust under supervision of the chancery court which assumed administration of the trust, the probate court had jurisdiction to determine whether a bequest under the will was payable, since it was concerned with administration of the estate, but it did not have jurisdiction to determine whether a petitioner had the right to rents and possession of trust lands, since that involved administration of the trust under supervision of the chancery court.

       Where testator devised his residuary estate to his widow “in fee simple forever” and in the next sentence of his will attempted to provide for the distribution of any other property that the widow had not disposed of during her lifetime or by her will, the limitation over was void, being inconsistent with the fee simple devise to the widow, but even so the court was not called upon to determine the validity of the latter paragraph, for a decision of that issue was not essential to a distribution of the estate, the distribution order contemplating the conclusive settlement in adversary proceeding, and the only issue that could be determined upon the filing of the final account was a proper physical distribution; even if the latter paragraph had been valid, it could not have been known at that time what property would be left undisposed of or what persons would then prove to be heirs later on. Therefore, the widow correctly interpreted the law in stating that she was the sole beneficiary of the estate. Collie v. Tucker, 229 Ark. 606, 317 S.W.2d 137 (1958).

        Exclusionary Clause.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       An exclusionary clause in a will lacking a residuary clause does not control intestate property held by the testatrix. Cook v. Estate of Seeman, 314 Ark. 1, 858 S.W.2d 114 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because intestate property passes by law rather than by will, the statute and not the testator controls the distribution of intestate property; therefore, although the testator's intent to disinherit is clearly and unambiguously expressed in a will, such exclusionary language will not be given effect as against the distribution of intestate property. Cook v. Estate of Seeman, 314 Ark. 1, 858 S.W.2d 114 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the fact that several beneficiaries were explicitly disinherited by the provisions of a will, the residue of the estate was distributed according to the rules of intestate succession because the residuary clause was ineffective; the presumption against partial intestacy was subordinate to the presumption against disherison.

       Where testator's will consisted of six separate sheets of holographic writings, five of which made specific devises to named relatives, while on the sixth sheet he devised to his nieces and nephews not otherwise named “all the rest of my property” and then without punctuation described thereon specific property and “rest of money after funeral expenses,” the sixth sheet did not constitute a devise of after-acquired properties and testator died intestate as to such after-acquired properties.

       Residuary bequest to the decedent's stepchildren in the decedent's last will and testament was voided because the decedent's spouse, who was removed from the will pursuant to an antenuptial agreement, did not predecease the decedent by 30 days so that the condition precedent in the will that would have allowed the stepchildren to inherit under the terms of the will was not met. Further, the circuit court's determination that the antenuptial agreement did not cancel the entirety of the decedent's will was not clearly erroneous.

       (a)
      </b>
      A will may validly devise or bequeath property to the trustee of a trust established or to be established (i) during the testator's lifetime by the testator, by the testator and some other person, or by some other person including a funded or unfunded life insurance trust, although the trustor has reserved any or all rights of ownership of the insurance contracts, or (ii) at the testator's death by the testator's devise to the trustee, if the trust is identified in the testator's will and its terms are set forth in a written instrument, other than a will, executed before, concurrently with, or after the execution of the testator's will or in another individual's will if that other individual has predeceased the testator, regardless of the existence, size, or character of the corpus of the trust. The devise or bequest is not invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable, or because the trust was amended after the execution of the will or the testator's death.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, property devised or bequeathed to a trust described in subsection (a) is not held under a testamentary trust of the testator, but it becomes a part of the trust to which it is devised or bequeathed, and must be administered and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the governing instrument setting forth the terms of the trust, including any amendments thereto made before or after the testator's death.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, a revocation or termination of the trust before the testator's death causes the devise or bequest to lapse.

      Acts 1981, No. 714, § 75: Mar. 25, 1981. Emergency clause provided: “It has been found and is declared by the General Assembly of Arkansas that existing law relating to such matters as homestead, dower, curtesy, statutory allowances payable from a decedent's estate, and the right of a surviving spouse to take against the will of a decedent, do not in all circumstances provide for equal treatment between the sexes, that the constitutionality of such existing law has been drawn into question by decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that there is an urgent need to insure that the law provides equality in the property rights and interests of married persons. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in force from the date of its approval.”

      <b>
       (a)(1)
      </b>
      In addition to their homestead, dower, and curtesy rights, the surviving spouse and minor children of a decedent, or either in the absence of the other, shall be entitled to have assigned to them out of the property owned by the decedent at the time of his or her death, personal property, tangible or intangible, to be selected prior to the sale thereof by the personal representative or after sale out of the proceeds thereof by the surviving spouse, if there is a surviving spouse or, otherwise, by the guardian of the minor children, when the personal property is of the value of four thousand dollars ($4,000) as against distributees or the value of two thousand dollars ($2,000) as against creditors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The right to such an allowance shall vest in the surviving spouse upon the death of his or her spouse, shall not terminate with his or her subsequent death or remarriage, and shall become his or her absolute property or the property of his or her estate upon death without restriction as to use, encumbrance, or disposition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If any of the minor children are not children of the surviving spouse, the allowance shall vest in the surviving spouse to the extent of one-half (½) thereof, and the remainder shall vest in the decedent's minor children in equal shares.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Such furniture, furnishings, appliances, implements, and equipment as shall be reasonably necessary for the family use and occupancy of his or her dwelling shall be assigned to and vested in the surviving spouse, if any, provided he or she was living with the decedent at the time of his or her death.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      During a period of two (2) months after the death of the decedent, the surviving spouse and minor children, or either in the absence of the other, shall be entitled to receive from the estate such reasonable amount, not exceeding in the aggregate one thousand dollars ($1,000), as in the judgment of the court may be required for their sustenance, in accordance with the usual living standards of the family.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      The provisions of subsections (a)-(c) of this section shall be cumulative, and the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall apply as against creditors and distributees.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The portion of this section which conferred dower rights upon a widow, but did not confer such rights upon a surviving husband was a gender based statute which did not serve an important governmental function and thus was unconstitutional, since it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981), overruled in part, Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where widow of decedent elected to take against the will and petitioned for statutory allowances under this section, which provided allowances of $2,000.00 plus $500.00 sustenance to a widow, but not a widower, there was no way under the facts of the case and the statutory language to extend benefits to the disfavored class, and thus benefits had to be denied to both widowers and widows by declaring this section unconstitutional as applied. Hess v. Wims, 272 Ark. 43, 613 S.W.2d 85 (1981) (decision under prior law).

   A devisee and beneficiary of a decedent's will who was not an heir and who stood to lose financially if the decedent's wife claimed against the will pursuant to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-401" target="_self">28-39-401</a></cite> and received statutory allowances provided for in this section, had standing to challenge the constitutionality of both statutes since the test was whether the party would lose financially unless the issue was raised.

       The allowance to the widow of specific articles of her husband's estate, not exceeding $150 in value, based upon the appraisement made for the administrator, instead of upon an appraisement made at the instance of the widow, was an irregularity merely and not prejudicial to the administrator.

       In a probate case, a circuit court erred in awarding property that was titled solely in the corporate name to the spouse as part of her statutory allowances; this section is applicable to the personal estate of the decedent.

       Although a court did not order an estate vested in a widow, in a proceeding to compel her to account, she could show the value and avail herself of statutory benefits. Hampton v. Physick, 24 Ark. (11 Barber) 561 (1867) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of the probate court allowing administrator to pay to herself, as widow of the decedent, statutory allowances and in addition one-third of all personal property and one-third of the cash in a bank did not assume the force of a judgment which was affected, in any way, by a nunc pro tunc order. Moudy v. Bradley, 200 Ark. 630, 140 S.W.2d 113 (1940) (decision under prior law).

   Where there was evidence to indicate that the estate may have included equity in an automobile, since the decedent had purchased the property, the administrator should have proceeded to pay for it from the assets of the estate, sold it as provided in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c49s28-49-107" target="_self">28-49-107</a></cite>, obtained authority to abandon it as permitted under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c49s28-49-106" target="_self">28-49-106</a></cite>, or applied to the court for assignment of it to her as part of her statutory allowance under this section, as she was accountable for it, either by accounting under the Probate Code or for conversion under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c49s28-49-105" target="_self">28-49-105</a></cite>.

    Publisher's Notes.
   
   In Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981), the Arkansas Supreme Court held that various statutes containing dower provisions were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because they were gender-based and did not serve an important governmental function. The statutes involved (§§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-101" target="_self">28-11-101</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-201" target="_self">28-11-201</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-301" target="_self">28-11-301</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-303" target="_self">28-11-303</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c11s28-11-306" target="_self">28-11-306</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-101" target="_self">28-39-101</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-401" target="_self">28-39-401</a></cite>) have since been amended to delete the gender-based classifications. The court recognized in the Stokes case that Ark. Const., Art. 9, § 6, which determines the homestead rights of a surviving widow and children, is also gender-based but refrained from passing on the validity of the section since homestead rights were not involved in the case. In response to this decision, the Arkansas General Assembly enacted the Homestead Exemption Act of 1981 (§§<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c66s16-66-210" target="_blank">16-66-210</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-201" target="_self">28-39-201</a></cite>), which provides a homestead exemption that is not gender-based.

       A widow is entitled to have dower and homestead allotted and admeasured in time in the land if it can be done without great prejudice to the parties; therefore, a widow was entitled to have the order of a probate court assigning her dower and homestead affirmed, and laches could not be urged by the son against his mother, the widow, inasmuch as he had entered into an agreement with his mother and brother as to farming the land, he also having agreed to the report of the commissioners allotting the dower and homestead lands.

       The domicile of the wife and minor children follows that of the husband, and their actual personal residence at the homestead place is not necessary to perfect the right in him, or to entitle them to the benefit of it after his death. Where the head of a family has, in good faith, selected a place of residence, owns the land, and has entered and resides upon it, the absence of the wife and children might require stronger proof of intention, but nothing more.

      After having been duly summoned and sworn by the clerk for that purpose, the commissioners shall proceed without delay to make a fair appraisal of the value of the lot, with the dwellings and appurtenances thereon. Within ten (10) days thereafter, they shall return the appraisal to the office of the clerk, to be by him or her immediately filed.

      If a majority of the commissioners decides that the lot so claimed as a homestead is within the valuation prescribed by the Arkansas Constitution, then it shall be the duty of the clerk to make an entry upon the records of the court, reciting the proceedings had and the return of the commissioners, and vesting the homestead in the party or parties claimant, and, also, to tax the costs of the proceedings against the party at whose instance the appraisal was made.

      Whenever it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court having probate jurisdiction, by the appraisal of the commissioners provided for in this chapter, that the lot exceeds in value the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), it shall be the duty of the court to order the lot to be sold by the sheriff of the county, at public auction to the highest bidders, for cash in hand, within sixty (60) days after the making of the order, and, upon thirty (30) days' advertisement of the sale and actual written notice served upon the surviving spouse and children, as to the time, place, and terms of the sale.

       (b)(1)

      It shall be the duty of the sheriff, should the lot bring more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), to pay over immediately the excess to the administrator or executor of the estate of the deceased and to hold the two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), subject to the order of the court or the judge, either in term time or in vacation, as the case may be.

      It shall be the duty of the heir at law of any estate of which the surviving spouse is entitled to dower or curtesy to lay off and assign the dower or curtesy as soon as practicable after the death of the deceased spouse. If the heirs to any estate are minors, they shall act, in the assignment of dower or curtesy, by their guardians.

      If the dower or curtesy assigned by the heir at law is accepted by the surviving spouse, the heir at law shall make a statement of the assignment, specifying what lands have been assigned, and the acceptance of the surviving spouse shall be endorsed thereon.

      The statements and specification of dower or curtesy, and acceptance thereof, shall be proved or acknowledged by both parties and filed with and recorded by the probate clerk of the circuit court, which will then be a sufficient assignment of dower or curtesy and shall bar any further demand for dower or curtesy in the property specified in the statement.

       If a widow conveys her unassigned dower interest, the heir may recover possession of the land from the widow's vendee, for the conveyance gives him a right only to have her dower set aside and assigned to him, her right of occupancy being personal and not transferable.

Emergency clause provided: “It appearing that the Legislature, in enacting The Arkansas Inheritance Code of 1969 (Act No. 303, approved March 21, 1969), failed to enact certain essential amendments to Sections 33 and 36 of Act 140 approved February 23, 1949, with the result that where a deceased testator or testatrix leaves no surviving descendant, his or her surviving spouse conceivably has the power to nullify the will of the deceased spouse to an extent to which in some situations might be unconscionable. It was not the intention of the 1969 General Assembly in the enactment of said Act No. 303 to grant a windfall to any person and to create an inequitable result. Therefore, the passage of this Act is for the purpose of clarification and to prevent misconstruction of Act No. 303. Since all property owners and titles to property, real and personal, are affected by said Act No. 303, it is hereby declared that the passage of this Act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety; and an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage and approval.”

      Acts 1981, No. 714, § 75: Mar. 25, 1981. Emergency clause provided: “It has been found and is declared by the General Assembly of Arkansas that existing law relating to such matters as homestead, dower, curtesy, statutory allowances payable from a decedent's estate, and the right of a surviving spouse to take against the will of a decedent, do not in all circumstances provide for equal treatment between the sexes, that the constitutionality of such existing law has been drawn into question by decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that there is an urgent need to insure that the law provides equality in the property rights and interests of married persons. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in force from the date of its approval.”

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      When a married person dies testate as to all or any part of his or her estate, the surviving spouse shall have the right to take against the will if the surviving spouse has been married to the decedent continuously for a period in excess of one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      In the event of such an election, the rights of the surviving spouse in the estate of the deceased spouse shall be limited to the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The surviving spouse, if a woman, shall receive dower in the deceased husband's real estate and personal property as if he had died intestate. The dower shall be additional to her homestead rights and statutory allowances; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The surviving spouse, if a man, shall receive a curtesy interest in the real and personal property of the deceased spouse to the same extent as if she had died intestate. The curtesy interest shall be additional to his homestead rights and statutory allowances; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If, after the assignment of dower or curtesy, as the case may be, and the payment of all statutory allowances, taxes, and debts, and the satisfaction of all testamentary gifts and devises, there shall remain some residue of the deceased spouse's estate which is not disposed of by will, then, if the deceased spouse shall have been survived by no natural or adopted child, or the descendants of any natural or adopted child, and by no parent, brother, sister, grandparent, uncle, aunt, great-grandparent, great-uncle, great-aunt, or the lineal descendants of any of them, then the surviving spouse will take by inheritance the undisposed residue.

      <p>
       This section, which allowed a widow, at her election, to take dower against the will of her husband under any condition, but allowed a husband to take curtesy against the will of his wife only if her will was executed before the marriage, was unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, since no valid compensatory purpose or justifiable governmental function could be found to sustain its gender-based discrimination. Hess v. Wims, 272 Ark. 43, 613 S.W.2d 85 (1981) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution since it was gender-based and served no important governmental function. Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981), overruled in part, Beck v. Merritt, 280 Ark. 331, 657 S.W.2d 549 (1983) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).

   A devisee and beneficiary of a decedent's will who was not an heir and who stood to lose financially if the decedent's wife claimed against the will pursuant to this section and received statutory allowances provided for in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c39s28-39-101" target="_self">28-39-101</a></cite> had standing to challenge the constitutionality of both statutes since the test is whether the party would lose financially unless the issue was raised. Huffman v. Dawkins, 273 Ark. 520, 622 S.W.2d 159 (1981) (decision prior to 1981 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   This section, which classes differently those people who have been married less than one year from those who have been married more than one year, does not violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution; this classification is not invidious because it bears a rational relationship to the permissible state objectives of preventing deathbed marriages and protecting the assets of a decedent in cases in which the assertion of a dower interest would often be contrary to the decedent's intent. In re Estate of Epperson, 284 Ark. 35, 679 S.W.2d 792 (1984), cert. denied, Epperson v. Estate of Epperson, <cite class="us_code">471 U.S. 1017</cite>, <cite class="s_court">105 S.

Huffman v. Dawkins, 273 Ark. 520, 622 S.W.2d 159 (1981); Hall v. Hall, 274 Ark. 266, 623 S.W.2d 833 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">456 U.S. 916</cite>, <cite class="s_court">102 S.

       Since this section as it existed prior to its amendment by Act 714 of 1981, under which a widow claimed her first election against the testator's will, was declared unconstitutional and since Act 714, which was not gender-based and allowed a widow to take the same as she could have taken under the old statute, could not be applied retroactively, a widow was not entitled to dower rights from the testator's estate where her claim arose prior to the enactment of Act 714.

      <p>
       Act 714 of 1981, which cured the constitutional infirmity of this curtesy statute by substituting a neutral-based treatment in place of the gender-based treatment, created substantive rights, not merely procedural rights, and is not subject to a retroactive application in favor of a surviving husband who sought a curtesy interest in the estate of his deceased wife.

      </p>

       Where a widow elects to take a dower interest against the will and consents to the conversion of the realty owned by testator at death into cash, as provided by the will, she may not, as the result of the conversion, thereby maintain a claim to one-third of the gross estate but, with respect to realty, is limited to a life interest in the proceeds from the sale of the realty.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the decedent had previously executed a reciprocal will and a separate contract not to revoke the wills with his first wife, and where the two wills of the couple created testamentary trusts giving the six children of their marriage the estate of the surviving spouse, the rights of the children as trust beneficiaries under the contract and reciprocal wills were paramount, and they prevailed over a second wife electing to take against the will. Gregory v. Estate of Gregory, 315 Ark. 187, 866 S.W.2d 379 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The decedent's surviving spouse was not entitled to take against the decedent's will where their marriage lasted only 13 days before he died, notwithstanding that they had been previously married three separate times for a total of more than 15 years. Shaw v. Shaw, 337 Ark. 530, 989 S.W.2d 919 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Surviving spouse alleging a decedent defrauded the spouse of the spouse's right to an elective share of the decedent's estate did not have to show common-law fraud because “fraud on marital rights” was not akin to common-law fraud.
   Thompson v. Thompson, 2014 Ark. 237, 434 S.W.3d 877 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a decedent's inter vivos trust defeated a surviving spouse's share of the decedent's estate, it was no error to let the spouse take from trust assets because (1) the assets were included in the decedent's estate only to calculate the spouse's elective share, and (2) the trust was otherwise left intact.
   Thompson v. Thompson, 2014 Ark. 237, 434 S.W.3d 877 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was no error to find a decedent intended to defraud a surviving spouse of the spouse's share of the decedent's estate because (1) evidence supported multiple findings that the decedent's $100,000 bequest intended to deprive the spouse of the spouse's share of the decedent's $6 million estate, and (2) the decedent's inter vivos gifts to the spouse were not considered as the gifts were not testamentary when made.

       Provisions of a will designating the particular beneficiaries for certain insurance policies which had been issued payable to testator's estate had same effect of changing the beneficiaries named in the policies as though testator had written to the insurance companies and followed their required procedure for changing beneficiaries; thus the policies did not pass to the executors as assets of the estate and were not subject to the dower interest of the testator's wife.

       Subsection (b) of this section applied only to wills and not to trusts created during the life of the settler, because the pretermitted-heir statute spoke only in terms of wills, and not of trusts; the pretermitted-heir statute, which spoke only in terms of the execution of a will, did not apply in instances in which there was no will.
   Kidwell v. Rhew, 371 Ark. 490, 268 S.W.3d 309 (2007).

        Purpose.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The object of former similar statute was to prevent injustice to a child or descendant from occurring by reason of the forgetfulness of a testator who might, at the time of making his will, overlook the fact that he has a child or descendant. Culp v. Culp, 206 Ark. 875, 178 S.W.2d 52 (1944) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of a former similar statute was not to require a testator to make some devise to each of his children, but to insure that there should be no unintentional disinheritance of a child by the testator. Taylor v. Cammack, 209 Ark. 983, 193 S.W.2d 323 (1946) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the pretermitted child statute is not to compel a testator to make a provision for his children, but to guard against testamentary thoughtlessness. Young v. Young, 288 Ark. 199, 703 S.W.2d 457 (1986).

       Extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to show that a testator was aware of a pretermitted child and intended to disinherit her. Hare v. First Sec. Bank, 261 Ark. 79, 546 S.W.2d 427 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, extrinsic evidence of the testator's intent is not admissible. Armstrong v. Butler, 262 Ark. 31, 553 S.W.2d 453 (1977); Mangum v. Estate of Fuller, 303 Ark. 411, 797 S.W.2d 452 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section operates in favor of a pretermitted child without regard to the real intention of the testator in regard to the omission. Armstrong v. Butler, 262 Ark. 31, 553 S.W.2d 453 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that one paragraph of a will provided that the decedent's estate would, upon nonsurvival of all the named heirs, pass under the laws of descent and distribution of Missouri did not establish that the decedent intended to omit her sons by her first marriage from the will, even though they were not mentioned in the will. Robinson v. Mays, 271 Ark. 818, 610 S.W.2d 885 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a decedent's holographic will, written during his residency in Canada, did not mention his children, under subsection (b) of this section that the omission operated in favor of the pretermitted children; hence, in the letter order issued by the trial court the children were properly awarded the decedent's real property in Arkansas. Craig v. Carrigo, 353 Ark. 761, 121 S.W.3d 154 (2003).

      </h4>
      <p>
       In a suit to recover the share of a child pretermitted by will, evidence that the plaintiff was born two months after her mother's marriage and that she resembled a man who had kept company with her mother was not sufficient to overcome the presumption that she was legitimate. Jacobs v. Jacobs, 146 Ark. 45, 225 S.W. 22 (1920) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption against intestacy is subordinate to the statutory presumption against the disherison of a child or the issue of a deceased child because the presumption against intestacy actually is much more than a presumption. Armstrong v. Butler, 262 Ark. 31, 553 S.W.2d 453 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       An omission in a will is presumed to be unintentional where the testator fails to mention his children or provide for them as a member of a class, if no contrary intent appears in the will itself. Robinson v. Mays, 271 Ark. 818, 610 S.W.2d 885 (1981).

      <p>
       The great grandchild of a testator could not recover upon the ground that she was not mentioned in the will of her ancestress if she was not living at the time the will was made or if her mother was then living and was named by class as a grandchild. King v. Byrne, 92 Ark. 88, 122 S.W. 96 (1909) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grandchildren held to be pretermitted. Gray v. Parks, 94 Ark. 39, 125 S.W. 1023 (1910) (decision under prior law); King v. King, 273 Ark. 55, 616 S.W.2d 483 (1981).

       Adopted children entitled to inherit as pretermitted children. James v. Helmich, 186 Ark. 1053, 57 S.W.2d 829 (1933) (decision under prior law); Graham v. Hill, 226 Ark. 258, 289 S.W.2d 186 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a daughter not mentioned in will was left something by a codicil and the codicil was invalid, she inherited as if there was no will. Noblit v. Noblit, 223 Ark. 220, 265 S.W.2d 520 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       A pretermitted child is entitled to his remedy during the administration of an estate, and the provision for recovering from the devisee is only brought into being after the estate has been closed or after sufficient funds have been paid out of the estate to prevent the pretermitted child from acquiring his full statutory share. Parker v. Bowlan, 242 Ark. 192, 412 S.W.2d 597 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where pretermitted children instituted a suit for a partition of the real estate in the estate within four months following wrongful distribution, their suit was timely and not barred by laches even though decedent had died some seven years before. Negovanov v. Wensko, 248 Ark. 1109, 455 S.W.2d 929 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Children held to be pretermitted. Farmers Coop. Ass'n v. Webb, 249 Ark. 277, 459 S.W.2d 815 (1970); Robinson v. Mays, 271 Ark. 818, 610 S.W.2d 885 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the testator failed to name two of her children who were deceased at the time of the execution of her will and her will also included a provision “If any of my children should die before I do,” the phrase “my children” was referring to only the children living at the time the codicil was executed. Thus, the grandchildren of the deceased children were pretermitted heirs and entitled to share in the estate. Estate of Cisco v. Cisco, 288 Ark. 552, 707 S.W.2d 769 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a general rule, the testator's use of a word which describes a class of persons is considered to be sufficient identification of the claimant to preclude the application of the pretermitted heir statute. Estate of Cisco v. Cisco, 288 Ark. 552, 707 S.W.2d 769 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grandchildren were pretermitted where neither they nor their father, who died before the will was executed, were mentioned or provided for in the will. Holland v. Willis, 293 Ark. 518, 739 S.W.2d 529 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section directs that children shall take as though decedent had died intestate only when testator fails to mention or provide for them, specifically or as a class, and does not permit children to take against will simply because testator failed to make provision for them in will; if testator mentioned children, specifically or as a class, this section does not apply and children are not pretermitted. Dykes v. Dykes, 294 Ark. 158, 741 S.W.2d 256 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the word “heir” or “heirs” is used by the testator in a colloquial sense to refer to children, or descendants, as opposed to a technical, legal sense, then the requirements of subsection (b) are met. Leatherwood v. Meisch, 297 Ark. 91, 759 S.W.2d 559 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Insertion of a rule-against-perpetuities clause and other general references to undesignated persons in a testator's will did not show that testator had his grandson, as issue of the testator's predeceased child, so clearly in mind as to have met the requirements of the pretermitted child statute, subsection (b) of this section. Alexander v. Estate of Alexander, 351 Ark. 359, 93 S.W.3d 688 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Illegitimate child was awarded a share of his father's estate as a pretermitted heir where the wife waived an issue regarding competent jurisdiction by failing to object to a failure to join the estate in a paternity action; moreover, collateral estoppel applied because the wife appeared at the paternity proceeding, it was fully litigated, the necessary party issue was not raised, and no appeal was filed. Taylor v. Hamilton, 90 Ark. App. 235, 205 S.W.3d 149 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Decedent's illegitimate, pretermitted child was not entitled to inherit from decedent as he was required to meet requirements of subsection (b) of this section, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-102ol1a1" target="_self">28-1-102(a)(1)</a></cite>, and the six requirements of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c09s28-9-209ol1d" target="_self">28-9-209(d)</a></cite>, but he failed to show that he had been recognized by the decedent or by a court and he failed to file his action within 180 days of decedent's death.

      </p>
      <p>
       Son's claim pursuant to the After-Born Child Statute, subsection (a) of this section, extinguished a nephew's rights as a named beneficiary of a joint will because the son's rights prevailed where there was a conflict between the rights of the couple to execute a joint will to dispose of their estates and the rights of an after-born child.

       A will in which the testator provides for all of his children as a class without expressly naming them is a sufficient mention of his children. Brown v. Nelms, 86 Ark. 368, 112 S.W. 373 (1908); Duensing v. Duensing, 112 Ark. 362, 165 S.W. 956 (1914) (decision under prior law).

       A bequest to a son of the testator and to son's children sufficiently designated the children. LeFlore v. Handlin, 153 Ark. 421, 240 S.W. 712 (1922) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Former statute was complied with where the testator either mentioned each of his children by name or provided for them as a class without naming them separately. Yeates v. Yeates, 179 Ark. 543, 16 S.W.2d 996, <cite class="alr">65 A.L.R. 466</cite> (1929) (decision under prior law).

      <p>
       Where testator actually wrote the name of his daughter in the body of his will along with a statement of the amount of insurance policy payable to her, he did not omit to mention the name of his daughter in his will and he did not die intestate as to her. Culp v. Culp, 206 Ark. 875, 178 S.W.2d 52 (1944) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was uncertainty or ambiguity in designated beneficiary of a will, extrinsic evidence was admissible for purpose of identifying intended beneficiary who was found not entitled to share in estate as a pretermitted heir under subsection (b).

      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the word “descendants” as a description of the beneficiaries of the trust sufficiently describes a class within the meaning of this section is to be determined by a consideration of the will as a whole. Petty v. Chaney, 281 Ark. 72, 661 S.W.2d 373 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Daughter who was not mentioned or provided for by name in her father's will was sufficiently mentioned or provided for in a paragraph of the will creating a trust for the testator's “descendants” and was not entitled to share in father's estate as a child whom testator failed to provide for. Petty v. Chaney, 281 Ark. 72, 661 S.W.2d 373 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering will as a whole, reference therein to “all of my heirs or other relatives” was sufficient to mention the testator's children as a class and to exclude them from inheritance. Young v. Young, 288 Ark. 199, 703 S.W.2d 457 (1986).

       This section does not require testator to provide for his heirs, only to mention them. Child does not have to be specifically named, but can be included as a member of the class. Holland v. Willis, 293 Ark. 518, 739 S.W.2d 529 (1987).

       This section is not broad enough to cover a child to whom the testator only stood in loco parentis, because birth or adoption, each, creates a permanent relationship whereas the relationship in loco parentis is temporary. Bryant v. Thrower, 239 Ark. 783, 394 S.W.2d 488 (1965).

      <p>
       If the names of all, any, or either of testator's children or their legal representatives were omitted in his will, the will was not void, but he would be deemed as having died intestate as to those omitted. Branton v. Branton, 23 Ark. 569, 1861 Ark. LEXIS 161 (1861); Boyd v. Epperson, 149 Ark. 527, 232 S.W. 939 (1921) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission of the name of a child from a will does not thereby make it void; but those omitted may recover of the devisees and legatees their distributive shares. Trotter v. Trotter, 31 Ark. 145 (1876); Bloom v. Strauss, 73 Ark. 56, 84 S.W. 511 (1904) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will of a citizen of another state seeking to transmit lands situated in this state was without effect as to the lands where he omitted to name his only surviving child therein. Crossett Lumber Co. v. Files, 104 Ark. 600, 149 S.W. 908 (1912) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not preclude persons other than the child from bringing a petition to contest a will. Parker v. Bowlan, 242 Ark. 192, 412 S.W.2d 597 (1967).

       The notice by a probate clerk to a surviving spouse to elect to take against a will is not jurisdictional, and therefore the failure to notify will not give her heirs her personal right to take against the will. Jeffcoat v. Harper, 224 Ark. 778, 276 S.W.2d 429 (1955).

       The adjudication by the probate court of the necessity for administration is conclusive in a collateral issue. Stewart v. Smiley, 46 Ark. 373 (1885); Sharp v. Himes, 129 Ark. 327, 196 S.W. 131 (1917) (decisions under prior law).

       The appointment by the probate court of an administrator is conclusive of the question of necessity for administration, but it is not conclusive of the question whether or not the lands of the estate are needed to pay debts. Turley v. Gorman, 133 Ark. 473, 202 S.W. 822 (1918) (decision under prior law).

       The will of a nonresident of this state may have original probate in this state if the testator owned property in this state which might be the subject of administration in this state, or where there was a debt or demand due the testator which required administration to collect. However, unless a nonresident has land in this state or debt or demand owing him, the will of the nonresident is not subject to probate in this state. McPherson v. McKay, 205 Ark. 1135, 172 S.W.2d 911 (1943) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error for the trial court to determine that it had venue to probate decedent's will because decedent was not a resident of that county at the time of his death and the statute clearly required probate proceedings to go forward in the county where decedent resided before his death; even if decedent was arguably domiciled in the county, venue was still not proper.

       2012 Arkansas probate of the decedent's will was proper because that will had previously been admitted to probate in Florida; even then, however, if the real property involved were purchased after the death of the testator by a third party from a person who, but for the will, would have been the intestate heir of the decedent, interests in the property would not be affected by the probate of the will after the expiration of the five-year period if the instrument of transfer had been recorded in the county where the real property is located.

       But for the will, the decedent's son would have been the intestate heir of the decedent, and the son quitclaimed his interest in the property to a company by an instrument recorded on June 24, 2009, and the will had not been admitted to probate in Arkansas until October 23, 2012; the trial court erred in denying the devisees'
   motion to intervene, given that, as named devisees of the property in question in the decedent's will, the devisees clearly had a recognized interest in the mineral interests in the property that the company's petition sought to settle.

       Former limitations period in effect prior to the 1963 amendment of this section barred probate of decedent's will because she died in 1962, and the five-year period from her death had passed. Delafield v. Lewis, 299 Ark. 50, 770 S.W.2d 659 (1989).

       Probate division of the circuit court was statutorily time-barred from administering an estate under this section because the probate court had no authority to administer an estate past the five-year limit set forth in the statute. Furthermore, the passage of almost 100 years from the death of the title owners of the real property in the estate was not an exception to the statute.

       Where oil, gas, and mineral interests were deeded from grandchild to her aunt several weeks before will was offered to probate in Louisiana, but that will was not offered for probate in Arkansas until 10 years later, the fact that the granddaughter may have had notice of the existence of the will before her conveyance did not cause the conveyance not to be qualified as a “purchase” under subsection (c) of this section and thus foreclose the admission of the will to probate despite the expiration of the five-year period under this section, since the phrase “purchase” as used in subsection (c) of this section does not mean or imply a bona fide purchaser without notice.

       Notice took the form recommended by one statute, and the essence of the notice was that one heir was opening the decedent's estate, but the actual probate proceeding she pursued was for the collection of a small estate, and the notice required for that is found in another statute, and appellants testified that they did not receive personal notice, and this testimony was not actually disputed; the trial court clearly erred when it found that the heir satisfied the statutory procedures for collection of a small estate.

       There is no requirement of notice of estate proceedings to parties who have no direct interest in decedents' estates, and those parties do not have standing to enter to the estate proceeding or to raise the issue whether decedents' offspring, who had been convicted of manslaughter in their death, could inherit from their estate.

       Circuit court applied the correct legal standard in considering the creditor's claims against the estate as untimely and did not improperly determine that written service of notice was unnecessary; the circuit court's statements that the creditor knew of decedent's death merely provided background information.

       Because the creditor failed to obtain a ruling on the issue of the personal representative's reasonable diligence in searching for creditors of the estate, the issue was summarily disposed of on appeal.

       In determining whether the creditor was entitled to notice, the circuit court merely provided background information that it deemed relevant to the issue of whether the creditor was either known or reasonably ascertainable, and it did not impose requirements on the creditor that were more stringent than the law provides.

      </h4>
      <p>
       When surviving son offered a will for probate, he had the burden of proving the genuineness of the signatures; he made such proof, and the will was admitted to probate. When other persons sought to contest the will, they had the burden of sustaining the contest on the alleged ground that the signatures to the will were a forgery. Ross v. Edwards, 231 Ark. 902, 333 S.W.2d 487 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported a probate court finding that testator's first wife, who claimed a dower interest in estate, had not carried the burden of proving invalidity of second marriage merely by showing validity of her marriage to deceased and the absence of any court record of divorce in any one of three counties of her state, as valid divorce could have been granted elsewhere. Miller v. Miller, 237 Ark. 66, 371 S.W.2d 511 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The party contesting the validity of the will has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence that the testator lacked mental capacity at the time the will was executed or that the testator acted under undue influence. Wells v. Estate of Wells, 325 Ark. 16, 922 S.W.2d 715 (1996).

   A party interested in the probate of the will of a nonresident could contest the probate upon the grounds of incapacity or undue influence. Selle v. Rapp, 143 Ark. 192, 220 S.W. 662, <cite class="alr">13 A.L.R. 494</cite> (1920) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to subsection (b), if a will contest was on any ground other than that another will had been discovered, and if the will contestant had been given proper notice, the contestant's grounds for objection had to be filed at or prior to the time of the hearing on the petition for probate; this section does not allow a party to make an oral objection to a will such that, while all the beneficiaries may not have been properly served, they had constructive and actual notice of the probating of the will.

       While, in a will contest, it would have been better practice to determine, as a preliminary question, the interest of any contestant whose right to sue as heir was disputed, the court could, in its discretion, submit to the jury this question, together with the main issue. Flowers v. Flowers, 74 Ark. 212, 85 S.W. 242 (1905) (decision under prior law).

      <p>
       Brothers and sisters of testator, who left surviving him heir in person of adopted son, were not “interested” persons, entitled to sue to set aside testator's will. Hawkins v. Hawkins, 218 Ark. 423, 236 S.W.2d 733 (1951).
      </p>

       Just any collateral heir is not necessarily an “interested person” with a right to contest the probate of a will under this section. Mabry v. Mabry, 259 Ark. 622, 535 S.W.2d 824 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remote heirs, decedent's sister, nieces and nephew, were not “interested persons” entitled to contest a will under subsection (a) because they would not have taken by intestate succession at that time since decedent's two daughters were were still living. Hardie v. Estate of Davis, 312 Ark. 189, 848 S.W.2d 417 (1993).
      </p>

       A daughter of the decedent, who received an equal share under the will at issue, had standing to question the validity of the will, notwithstanding that her interest was not detrimentally affected by the will. Barrera v. Vanpelt, 332 Ark. 482, 965 S.W.2d 780 (1998).

       Trial court had authority to consider a challenge to decedent's will subsequent to a hearing at which it orally announced its decision to admit a purported will to probate because no written order had been entered and filed of record from the prior hearing; subsection (b) of this section was not applicable because the trial court never lost subject-matter jurisdiction and was free to hear additional evidence and to alter its decision upon further consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the will. Judkins v. Hoover, 351 Ark. 552, 95 S.W.3d 768 (2003), overruled in part, West v. Williams, 355 Ark. 148, 133 S.W.3d 388 (2003).

       In a will contest pursuant to this section, admission of a testator's will to probate was proper because preponderance of the evidence supported the circuit court's finding that both sons had confidential relationships with the testator, that the testator had testamentary capacity when he executed his will, and that the will was not the result of undue influence.

      </p>
      <p>
       After a probate court has probated a will, necessarily putting testamentary capacity in issue, equity has no jurisdiction to review this capacity, even though no jurisdictional objection is made, unless there is extrinsic fraud upon the probate court because the Arkansas Constitution places exclusive probate jurisdiction in the probate court.

       Trial court erred in finding that decedent's spouse and brother did not procure the will, and, as such, they were obligated to rebut the presumption of undue influence, however, nothing in the record suggested that their influence operated to override the decedent's discretion or destroy the decedent's free will, and a medical doctor and other disinterested witnesses testified that the decedent was of sound mind when decedent executed his will; thus, the trial court's error was harmless.

       Trial court had authority to consider a challenge to decedent's will subsequent to a hearing at which it orally announced its decision to admit a purported will to probate; subsection (a) of this section was not applicable because no written order was entered after the hearing and, thus, there was no order permitting a will to probate to set aside. Judkins v. Hoover, 351 Ark. 552, 95 S.W.3d 768 (2003), overruled in part, West v. Williams, 355 Ark. 148, 133 S.W.3d 388 (2003).

       Once the signing of a will is proven by two attesting witnesses, and there is no suggestion of fraud or undue influence, there is a presumption that the testator declared to the attesting witnesses that the instrument was his will; and that he either signed in front of them or acknowledged to them his signature on the instrument; and that the attesting witnesses signed at the request of and in the presence of the testator.

       Where 11 witnesses stated that they were familiar with the signature and handwriting of the deceased and expressed their opinion that a proffered will was written entirely in the handwriting of the deceased, but court-appointed expert declared the will a forgery, the court's holding that the will was forged was not against the preponderance of the evidence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a witness to a will testified that she witnessed the will at the request of the testator and in the presence of the other attesting witness who was then deceased, but whose signature was identified by his son and his widow, this testimony met the requirement of this section for the testimony of “credible disinterested witnesses” and thus the will was sustained as an attested will. Walpole v. Lewis, 254 Ark. 89, 492 S.W.2d 410 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in admitting a will to probate because the proponent failed to prove the will by either two attesting witnesses or two credible disinterested witnesses, and there was no showing that any diligence was exercised in procuring the testimony of one of the attesting witnesses. Carter v. Meek, 70 Ark. App. 447, 20 S.W.3d 417 (2000).

       Proper execution of a will to be probated could be proven by all or any one of the subscribing witnesses, or by only one witness who testified positively to the request of its execution and another witness did not recollect or denied some of the requests. Leister v. Chitwood, 216 Ark. 418, 225 S.W.2d 936 (1950) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements outlined in subsection (a)(1) for proving an attested will by the testimony of two attesting witnesses were satisfied where (1) the two attesting witnesses were credible disinterested witnesses, (2) each witness testified that his or her signature was on the will as an attesting witnesses, (3) one witness was able to provide testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the decedent coming into his office and asking him to draft the will and later a codicil, and he also testified that he and his secretary routinely acted as witnesses to wills prepared for his clients and that they would not sign the document until the testator had signed the will and requested that they attest it, and (4) the other witness testified that she would not have acted as a witness to the will or codicil if they had not been properly executed.

      <p>
       Where the testator and both attesting witnesses were dead, all the contestants had to do was to prove that any one of the three signatures was a forgery, in order to defeat probate, since a valid will, other than holographic, must have two witnesses. Ross v. Edwards, 231 Ark. 902, 333 S.W.2d 487 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where only one attesting witness testified that the will contained the signature of the testator and the other witness, the widow of the second attesting witness, only identified her husband's signature as an attesting witness without offering testimony regarding the signature of the testator, the requirements of this section were not met, and the probate judge correctly refused to admit the will to probate. Children's Mercy Hosp. v. Chick, 262 Ark. 520, 559 S.W.2d 3 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not clearly err in finding that a will was witnessed by the appropriate number of witnesses and with the required formalities under this section where the will and the proof of will were signed by three witnesses, even though only two were required, and where the two living witnesses testified, along with the will's notary. Although the testimony was conflicting, the appellate court left to the trial court the weight to be given to the testimony of the witnesses.

   This section completely leaves out any procedure for establishing a will which has been effectively destroyed by the testator; it does provide for the method of proving a will which has been lost or destroyed by accident or design of some person other than the testator. The only logical reason for not making provisions for proof of a will destroyed intentionally by a testator, in accordance with §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c25s28-25-109" target="_self">28-25-109</a></cite>, is obvious; there is no will to prove — it has been legally and physically extinguished.

       A will determines the rights of the parties under it proprio vigora from the death of the testator. Its probate is necessary to fix the right of the executor to execute it, to point out the person authorized to act, and as a basis and prerequisite to letters testamentary, but is not essential to its validity. Rights under it are not lost by failure to probate, and to establish and protect them, the validity of a will may be shown in any court. Arrington v.

      </h4>
      <p>
       To establish lost or destroyed wills, it is not sufficient simply to establish the fact that there was a will; it is essential that the proof show its provisions. Dudgeon v. Dudgeon, 119 Ark. 128, 177 S.W. 402 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will offered for probate was regular in form and met all the statutory requirements, including attestation of witnesses, the contestants had the burden to introduce testimony which clearly, positively, and satisfactorily established the contents of a subsequent will, and it was not sufficient to show that the will had been executed containing a revocation clause of former wills; they should have introduced testimony showing the entire contents of the will or all the material parts of it. Reed v. Johnson, 200 Ark. 1075, 143 S.W.2d 32 (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden is not to overcome the presumption of revocation of a will by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence, since only a preponderance of the evidence is required. Garrett v. Butler, 229 Ark. 653, 317 S.W.2d 283 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proponent of lost will has the burden of proving execution of will and its contents. One seeking to establish lost will must prove its execution and contents by strong, cogent, and convincing evidence, though he is not required to produce evidence sufficient to remove all reasonable doubt. Conkle v. Walker, 294 Ark. 222, 742 S.W.2d 892 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in finding that subdivision (2)(A) of this section did not require a second will to have physically existed at the time of the father's death, given case law stating that subdivision (2)(A) meant legal existence, not physical existence.

       A lost will may be proved at a trial although it has never been reinstated as a lost record. Turley v. Evins, 109 Ark. 115, 158 S.W. 1080 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       Until it is shown that a will has been duly executed, there can be no establishment of a lost will. Porter v. Sheffield, 212 Ark. 1015, 208 S.W.2d 999 (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not necessary for the trial judge to determine what became of decedent's will; it was enough that he found that it was not revoked or cancelled by her. Thomas v. Thomas, 30 Ark. App. 152, 784 S.W.2d 173 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was insufficient to prove a lost will since the decedent's failure to revoke or destroy his will as testified to by the appellant did not constitute evidence that the will was in existence at the time of his death and there was no proof in the record that the will was fraudulently destroyed before the decedent died. Matheny v. Heirs of Oldfield, 72 Ark. App. 46, 32 S.W.3d 491 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Lost will” was improperly admitted to probate; the fact that the decedent retained a copy of the lost will was improperly considered by the trial court in determining whether the presumption of revocation was rebutted and the executor named in the lost will did not otherwise meet his burden of establishing the lost will. Remington v. Roberson, 81 Ark. App. 36, 98 S.W.3d 44 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court properly denied a petition by testator's brother to probate an Israeli will as a lost will where the brother failed to prove by strong, cogent, and convincing evidence that the testator executed the Israeli will; further, the testator's widow and a business associate testified that the signature on the Israeli will was not the testator's. Abdin v. Abdin, 94 Ark. App. 12, 223 S.W.3d 60 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court found that the statutory requirements were met and the estate rebutted the presumption of revocation; the testimony overcame the presumption, as there was ample evidence that decedent was determined her son would not inherit anything, plus she believed her estate planning was complete, and the admission of a copy of the will to probate was not found to be error.
   Whatley v. Estate of McDougal, 2013 Ark. App. 709, 430 S.W.3d 875 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimony supported a conclusion that the will was in existence at the time of the decedent's death, and it was not necessary for the circuit court to determine what happened to the decedent's original will; it was enough that the trial court found that the will was not revoked or cancelled by the decedent.
   Whatley v. Estate of McDougal, 2013 Ark. App. 709, 430 S.W.3d 875 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lost will case, there was no strong, cogent, or convincing evidence about the circumstances under which the purported will was produced—it may have been typewritten, handwritten, or printed from a computer. In the absence of proof of one of the necessary elements to prove a lost will, it could not be said that the circuit court erred in finding that the executrix of the decedent's estate failed to prove both the execution and contents of the will.

      <p>
       In a proceeding to admit photocopied copy of a decedent's executed will as final will of the decedent under theory that the original will was lost or accidently destroyed, the testimony of the drafting attorney that he had caused a copy of the executed will to be made and kept the copy in his possession and the testimony of the attorney and both witnesses to the will as to how, when, and where the will was executed properly proved the will despite the argument that it was possible to transpose a witness' signature by photocopying, since there was no evidence of such transposition.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where there is no direct or positive testimony showing that a will was in existence at time of a decedent's death or that it was fraudulently destroyed before his death, where it is admitted that the will cannot be found, the law presumes the revocation of the will; however, presumption may be overcome by proof. Garrett v. Butler, 229 Ark. 653, 317 S.W.2d 283 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where in a will contest although the evidence was sufficient to prove that a will, a copy of which was introduced, was actually executed by the testator, the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption that a will in the possession of, or accessible to, the testator was revoked by the testator where the will could not be produced at his death, since there was no evidence offered to suggest that the will had been fraudulently destroyed, misplaced, or destroyed by accident. Wharton v. Moss, 267 Ark. 723, 594 S.W.2d 856 (Ct. App. 1979).

Emergency clause provided: “It has been found and is declared by the General Assembly of Arkansas that existing law relating to such matters as homestead, dower, curtesy, statutory allowances payable from a decedent's estate, and the right of a surviving spouse to take against the will of a decedent, do not in all circumstances provide for equal treatment between the sexes, that the constitutionality of such existing law has been drawn into question by decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that there is an urgent need to insure that the law provides equality in the property rights and interests of married persons. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in force from the date of its approval.”

   Circuit court erred in granting the declaratory judgment in favor of the heirs and ordering the decedent's land to be sold and the proceeds divided accordingly, where the circuit court's ruling was based on an erroneous interpretation and application of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c40s28-40-104" target="_self">28-40-104</a></cite>; because the small-estate procedure was excepted from the requirements of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c40s28-40-104" target="_self">28-40-104</a></cite> and this section, the issue of whether the beneficiary commenced a probate proceeding was irrelevant.

       Heir's failure to act in substantial compliance with the Probate Code required the court to hold that her disposition of the property was void; she was never appointed as administrator, the decedent's will was never admitted or declared valid, and appellants never received notice of the collection of the small estate, and the administrator's deed was void.
   Bryant v. Osborn, 2014 Ark. 143 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice took the form recommended by one statute, and the essence of the notice was that one heir was opening the decedent's estate, but the actual probate proceeding she pursued was for the collection of a small estate, and the notice required for that is found in another statute, and appellants testified that they did not receive personal notice, and this testimony was not actually disputed; the trial court clearly erred when it found that the heir satisfied the statutory procedures for collection of a small estate.

In that event, the applicant, in the manner directed or approved by the court, shall give notice of the application to the foreign personal representative, if the foreign personal representative's name and address are known, and to the court which appointed him or her, if the court is known. If, at the time of filing the application, the name and address of the foreign representative or the court which appointed him or her are not known, the notice shall be given as soon thereafter, either before or after the issuance of letters, as the facts pertaining thereto become known.

       The refusal of a court to appoint a Texas domiciliary administrator as ancillary administrator was not an abuse of discretion where all of the assets of the estate, with the exception of an apparent small amount of personal property in Texas, were located in Arkansas, and that property would likely have to be sold for the payment of debts.

       Evidence that the bulk of decedent's property was located in Perry County, Arkansas, which would probably have to be sold to pay decedent's debts, and that the creditors of decedent lived in Perry County was sufficient to sustain a finding by the probate court that it was not in the best interest of the estate to appoint a Texas administrator located two hundred miles away in Texarkana as ancillary administrator.

       A chancery court's refusal to remove testamentary trustee on ground of trustee's absence in the military service, where it appeared he was not neglecting the trust estate, was not an abuse of discretion. Blumenstiel v. Morris, 207 Ark. 244, 180 S.W.2d 107 (1944) (decision under prior law).

       This section does not make it compulsory on a court to make an appointment in the order of priority mentioned, and for sufficient cause and in unusual circumstances, as where the applicant of that class is not qualified or, in the court's opinion, will not best manage and improve the estate, the court may refuse an appointment though the applicant is otherwise qualified. Burnett v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co., 228 Ark. 857, 310 S.W.2d 806 (1958); Knight v. Worthen Bank & Trust Co., 233 Ark. 465, 345 S.W.2d 361 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a court is not bound to appoint from the highest priority nominees if it finds sufficient cause or unusual circumstances, in the absence of unusual circumstances or sufficient cause, it is the duty of the court to follow the statutes such as this section as set out by the General Assembly.

       Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in not removing a coexecutor as one of the coexecutors of a decedent's estate, under this section, because (1) although the circuit court found that the coexecutor had made some errors as one of the coexecutors, it also found that the coexecutor was not intentionally attempting to harm the widow; (2) the circuit court did not find that any of the coexecutor's actions endangered the estate property or that they were intended to harm any party; and (3) the circuit court weighed the coexecutor's actions, both positive and negative, and found that, on balance, the positive benefits to the estate outweighed the negative.

       Decision not to remove the personal representatives was not clearly erroneous, because the appellate court could not say that the circuit courts decision had left a definite and firm conviction that a mistake had been committed, when the circuit court admonished the personal representatives to put the widow's interests above their own since they owed her a fiduciary duty, and the circuit court understood that there was animosity but noted that there would be court supervision of the probate process.

      When the personal representative has performed substantial duties with respect to or on account of real property of the decedent, the court, in addition to other compensation provided by the Probate Code, may allow a reasonable compensation for such services with the amount thereof to be fixed by the court, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the services, the extent and value of the real property, and other relevant circumstances.

       (3)
      </b>
      If the schedule of fees as provided in subdivision (d)(2) of this section is determined by the court to be either excessive or insufficient under the circumstances, then the court shall allow the attorney a fee commensurate with the value of the legal services rendered.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)
      </b>
      When authorized by the will or the court, the personal representative may employ accountants, engineers, appraisers, and other persons whose services are reasonably required in connection with the administration of the estate, and the court shall fix or approve the compensation for such services, which shall be allowed as an item of expense of the administration.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (f)(1)
      </b>
      Upon election, a personal representative may fix his or her or its own fee and the fees of the attorneys for the estate or any accountant, auditor, or investment advisor without prior approval from the court, but the reasonableness of the compensation of any person so employed or the compensation for the services of the personal representative, either on petition of any interested person, on petition by the personal representative, or on the court's own motion, shall be reviewed by the court.

      <b>

      <p>
       The fact that an administrator was authorized by a probate court to institute a suit to recover in proper forum an amount due the estate and employ attorneys, did not give the court in which the suit was instituted jurisdiction to distribute the attorney's fees; rather, the entire fund recovered became the property of the estate to be administered by the probate court. Gilleylen v. Hallman, 141 Ark. 52, 216 S.W. 15 (1919) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the value of the personalty plus real property was $1,484,200, the attorney's fee of $22,500 was not excessive. Sloss v. Farmers Bank & Trust Co., 290 Ark. 304, 719 S.W.2d 273 (1986).
      </p>

       This section authorizes the probate court to increase or decrease legal fees in accordance with the value of legal services rendered. Nabers v. Estate of Setser, 310 Ark. 194, 833 S.W.2d 375 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of attorney fees to siblings' brother for legal work on their mother's estate was appropriate because the trial court's order recited the factors taken into consideration in making the award, which was approximately one-third less than the amount authorized by this section. Rollins v. Rollins, 94 Ark. App. 65, 224 S.W.3d 554 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fees awarded to an estate's attorney from a testator's son were not excessive under subdivision (d)(3) of this section because the attorney's statement set forth, in detail, the work required to address the son's seemingly endless actions that delayed the proceeding and prevented an orderly distribution of the estate; the son filed numerous, unfounded motions and consistently opposed the actions taken by the executor and other heirs.
   Shafer v. Estate of Shafer, 2012 Ark. App. 177, 393 S.W.3d 565 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was within the trial court's discretion to award attorney's fees to a successor trustee for services that were rendered in connection with the administration of an estate where it was apparent that there was a dispute regarding distribution that would require adjudication by a court, and the successor trustee had litigated whether certain items of real property were trust assets and also the efficacy of the trust documents created by the wife after her husband's death.

       In an order to entitle an attorney to retain a commission out of moneys of an estate collected under the employment of the administrator, it was necessary to show that the probate court authorized the employment. Turner v. Tapscott, 30 Ark. 312 (1874), overruled, Pike v. Thomas, 62 Ark. 223, 35 S.W. 212 (1896) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section specifically authorizes the personal representative to employ legal counsel and contemplates that counsel's fee will be paid by the estate, not the personal representative. Alexander v. First Nat'l Bank, 278 Ark. 406, 646 S.W.2d 684 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate courts can authorize the administrator to employ counsel in the necessary protection of the estate in his hands and may allow fees for such services rendered the administrator to protect and preserve the estate; however, the court has no jurisdiction to award fees for services rendered to an individual beneficiary.

       Attorneys were not deprived of a property right without due process of law where their contract of employment with an administrator for the purpose of filing wrongful death action was terminated by probate court without notice to them or opportunity to be heard after appointment of successor administrator, since the order of court was purely prospective in operation and did not involve denial of due process. Gentry v. Richardson, 228 Ark. 677, 309 S.W.2d 721 (1958).

       A party has no right to make a contract for legal services which is binding on a court; however a court has the power and jurisdiction to approve a claim for legal services made by a party where the court feels the claim is justified. Black v. Thompson, 237 Ark. 304, 372 S.W.2d 593 (1963).

       Where there was no order of the probate court authorizing an administrator to employ an attorney, it was in the discretion of the court to allow him credit for fees paid to an attorney, and its order was conclusive where no abuse was shown. Reynolds v. Canal & Banking Co., 30 Ark. 520 (1875) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   An attorneys' fees award which was less than the statutory standard set out in this section was not an abuse of court's discretion where the bulk of the services performed by the attorneys in the probate proceedings were done on behalf of the executor in its individual capacity to obtain credits for tax payments made out of the in-state assets of the estate. Estate of Torian v. Smith, 263 Ark. 304, 564 S.W.2d 521 (1978), cert. denied, First Nat'l Bank v. Smith, <cite class="us_code">439 U.S. 883</cite>, <cite class="s_court">99 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where executor's position was in derogation of the interests of the estate as a whole, the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the attorneys' fees to be paid from the assets of the estate. Croft v. Clark, 24 Ark. App. 16, 748 S.W.2d 149 (1988).
      </p>

       The probate judge has authority to approve legal fees in excess of the statutory legal fees under subsection (d) and to approve accounting fees under subsection (e). Morris v. Cullipher, 306 Ark. 646, 816 S.W.2d 878 (1991).

       Although the statutory fee schedule was not an inflexible maximum where a fee of $2,000 for the preparation of estate tax returns was covered by a separate agreement with an individual as beneficiary of the will rather than as executor and it was not authorized or approved by the probate court, the allowance to attorney of fee for administration work in connection with estate in excess of the fee schedule was not justified and attorney was not entitled to the $2,000 for preparation of estate tax return.

       Where a portion of the heirs and distributees employed an attorney to contest the settlement of the executor, the probate court had no power to direct the payment of the attorney's fee by the executor out of the residuary fund of the estate; if it was a proper case for contribution by all interested in the estate, the remedy was in chancery only.

       Former statute fixed the compensation of an administrator for his entire trouble and risk in attending to the settlement of an estate, and not merely for collecting its debts.

       Where the successor administrator collected rents and made disbursements, and there was no evidence that it made any discretionary or time-consuming judgments with respect to the management of the real estate, there was no evidence of “substantial services” having been performed; therefore, the successor administrator was not entitled to extra fees in excess of the listed percentages. Sloss v. Farmers Bank & Trust Co., 290 Ark. 304, 719 S.W.2d 273 (1986).

      <p>
       Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a coexecutor of a decedent's estate a $5000 executor's fee, under subsection (c) of this section, because the circuit court considered the proper factors because (1) the coexecutor was found not to have acted so as to intentionally harm the widow and to have provided valuable services to the estate; (2) the circuit court found that the undervaluation of the estate property could have harmed the heirs in terms of estate taxes and that the coexecutor's actions (such as the construction of the will) benefitted some of the heirs to the detriment of other heirs; and (3) the circuit court found that a higher fee was warranted.

       Fees awarded to an executor from a testator's son were not excessive under subsection (a) of this section because the executor, who coordinated a judicial sale of the real and personal property while struggling with the behavior of the son, testified about the necessity of the services, the lack of duplication, and the huge role that the son played in delaying the closing of the estate.

However, on rehearing where it was established that the actual operation of the store was under the management of third persons and that the work by the executor was not substantially greater than that usually done by personal representatives the fee was reduced to $2,489.34 as to the personalty and $250 as to the realty.

      <p>
       A cause of action did not accrue upon an administrator's bond until his accounts were settled and an order made by the court directing him to pay the amount found due to the parties entitled to receive it. George v. Elms, 46 Ark. 260 (1885); State ex rel. McCreary v. Roth, 47 Ark. 222, 1 S.W. 98 (1886) (preceding decisions under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a probate court made a settlement of a deceased administrator's accounts before an administrator was appointed on his estate, neither the principal nor his sureties were legally before the court, and such settlement would not be a cause of action on the bond. State v. Drake, 52 Ark. 350, 12 S.W. 706 (1889) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the accounts of an administrator showing nothing due from him were confirmed by the probate court, no liability would rest upon his sureties until the settlement thus made was impeached in a court of equity. Crouch v. Edwards, 52 Ark. 499, 12 S.W. 1070 (1889) (decision under prior law).

       It was within the power of the probate court, on the application of a surety in an administrator's bond, to require the administrator to give a new bond when it was made to appear that the sureties in his bond were insufficient. Renfro v. White, 23 Ark. (10 Barber) 195 (1861) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       On affidavit filed by interested party in an estate that the administrator was insolvent, it was error for the probate court to revoke the letters of administration without requiring the administrator to give additional bond and without showing that his securities were not ample. Collier v. Kilcrease, 27 Ark. 10 (1871) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A probate court had no authority, on application of guardian, to substitute new bonds and sureties for old bonds and sureties theretofore approved and accepted by it for reasons which are not provided by statute.

       Where a surety upon a guardian's bond who had been compelled to pay over money due by the guardian upon termination of the fiduciary relation sued his cosurety for contribution, it was no defense that the plaintiff consented that the guardian might retain and use the ward's money by paying interest therefor and that the probate court thereupon made an order reciting such consent and authorizing the guardian to retain the money “until further order.” Berton v.

       Where a will provided for appointment of widow as executor without giving bond and without making reports and settlements, the remainderman in the estate had no right to require a bond and an accounting from the widow who was a life tenant, without alleging and proving mismanagement, waste, or conversion.

      <p>
       Where letters testamentary were granted by the clerk, in vacation, he had no discretion in any case to dispense with the bond required by statute, even where the will directed otherwise; rather, in such matters the probate court had a large discretion, which would not be controlled by the Supreme Court, unless abused.

       The sureties on an administrator's bond could apply to the probate court to be discharged on any statutory ground; however, such an application could not be made under a former statute relating to the discharge of sureties on official bonds.

       Where guardian and sureties were before the probate court and an order permitting substitution of surety, approving new bond, and releasing the sureties on the original bond was made by the court of its own motion, but not entered on the record, an order nunc pro tunc, directing that it be shown on the judgment record, was proper, but the order did not discharge former sureties from liability that might have accrued prior to the order.

       A probate court had no authority, on the application of a guardian, to substitute new bonds and sureties for old bonds and sureties theretofore approved and accepted by it, for reasons which were not provided by statute. White v. New Amsterdam Cas. Co., 195 Ark. 249, 111 S.W.2d 477 (1937) (decision under prior law).

       Where the guardian and sureties were before the probate court and an order permitting substitution of surety, approving new bond, and releasing the sureties on the original bond was made by the court of its own motion, but not entered on the record, an order nunc pro tunc, directing that it be shown on the judgment record, was proper; but the order did not discharge the former sureties from liability that might have accrued prior to the order.

       An order requiring a personal representative to secure a bond was proper and did not constitute a deprivation of due process where (1) the appellees complied with subsection (c)(2) by filing their written demand (i.e., their administrative claim) and petitioning the probate court for an order directing the estate's assets be returned or, alternatively, requiring the personal representative to secure a bond, (2) the petition was served upon the personal representative, and (3) the probate court held a hearing on the petition and granted the relief sought in the petition.

      <p>
       The statute of limitations did not begin to run in favor of a surety on a deceased guardian's bond until there was a final settlement of the guardian's accounts in the probate court and an order to pay over the balance due the ward. State ex rel. Davis v. Buck, 63 Ark. 218, 37 S.W. 881 (1896); Rhea v. Bagley, 66 Ark. 93, 49 S.W. 492 (1899) (decisions under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon termination of the guardianship relation and an adjustment of the accounts and establishment of the amount due from the guardian, the cause of action accrued at once, if there was some person capable of suing; if there was no such person, then the cause of action was postponed until there was someone capable of suing. Wallace v. Swepston, 74 Ark. 520, 86 S.W. 398 (1905) (decision under prior law).

       An order of a probate court ascertaining amount of funds in hands of administrator and directing him to pay the funds into court for benefit of heirs, without naming them, was not an order of distribution sufficient to authorize heirs to sue on administrator's bond to recover funds for their own use.

       A suit could not be brought on a bond until there was an order of the probate court to pay over. Connelly v. Weatherford, 33 Ark. 658 (1878); Vance v. Beattie, 35 Ark. 93 (1879); State ex rel. Davis v. Buck, 63 Ark. 218, 37 S.W. 881 (1896); Beakley v. Cunningham, 112 Ark. 71, 165 S.W. 259 (1914) (decisions under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The settlement by the probate court of a deceased guardian's account was sufficient to support an action against his surety for the amount found due, though no order of payment was made. Smith v. Smithson, 48 Ark. 261, 3 S.W. 49 (1887) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule that a cause of action against a surety on a guardian's bond did not accrue until the amount of the liability was established by an order of the probate court and an order was made by such court directing the amount to be paid over was limited, so far as the prerequisite of an order to pay over was concerned, to settlements which were not final and where the guardianship was left continuing. Wallace v. Swepston, 74 Ark. 520, 86 S.W. 398 (1905) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       An action on a bond was not maintainable until the probate court had adjusted the accounts of the administrator and ordered him to pay over the amount found to be in his hands. Planters' Mut. Ins. Ass'n v. Harris, 96 Ark. 222, 131 S.W. 949 (1910) (decision under prior law).

       A distributee of an estate was not entitled to bring an action against the administrator for waste or conversion of the assets without showing that the claims of creditors had been satisfied; however, if judgment was obtained, the amount recovered should have been paid to the administrator in succession, to be distributed under direction of the probate court. Brice v. Taylor, 51 Ark. 75, 9 S.W. 854 (1888) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of administrator to comply with an order of distribution was such a breach of his bond as justified action by a distributee. Ferguson v. Carr, 85 Ark. 246, 107 S.W. 1177 (1908) (decision under prior law).

     “Whereas, due to the changed nature of the economy of Arkansas, it is no longer true that real property constitutes the sound core of the assets of most estates; and in many instances the estate of a decedent now includes investments represented by personal property more desirable than certain types of real property to be preserved for distribution to the heirs at law or beneficiaries of the will of the decedent; and by the provisions of the Probate Code it was the intention of the General Assembly of Arkansas of 1949 to give suitable recognition to this change; but it now appears that apparently conflicting provisions in that Code have given rise to ambiguity and uncertainty of interpretation thereof;

       Where defendant also served as a co-executrix of her mother's estate, subdivision (b)(2) of this section permitted her to preserve and maintain real property in the estate, but where the title to the real property vested in defendant immediately on her mother's death, the circuit court erred in approving any expenditures for the property made after the mother's death.

       Where decedent's will devised her real property to her daughter so long as she outlived her brother, the property passed to decedent's daughter and vested in fee simple absolute; the property was not an asset in the hands of the estate representative for purposes of this section. Therefore, a receipt for assets of the estate signed by the family after decedent's death did not constitute a family settlement agreement which altered the terms of decedent's will.

       An administrator was not entitled to possession of lands of which his intestate had only a naked legal title without substantial interest. Chowning v. Stanfield, 49 Ark. 87, 4 S.W. 276 (1886) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       An administrator could not stand for or represent the heirs when the title to land was involved, nor was he entitled to the possession of lands unless they were needed to pay debt of the deceased. Jones v. Jones, 107 Ark. 402, 155 S.W. 117 (1913) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       While lands were assets in the hands of an executor or administrator for purpose of payment of debts of estate, yet the title to the lands passed direct to the heirs upon death of an intestate subject only to right of administrator to have the lands sold if it was necessary for payment of the decedent's debts. Pfaff v. Heizman, 218 Ark. 201, 235 S.W.2d 551, 23 A.L.R.2d 957 (1951) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section were not designed to make an administrator automatically entitled to the real estate of a deceased intestate and did not change the rule that legal title to an intestate's land upon his death vests and descends to his heirs at law, subject to the widow's dower and the payment of debts through his administrator. Cranna v. Long, 225 Ark. 153, 279 S.W.2d 828 (1955).

       An administrator was entitled to the possession of any real estate of which his intestate died seized and could maintain ejectment against the heirs at law, except the widow or her tenant occupying the mansion and farm attached before the assignment of dower. Carnall v. Wilson, 21 Ark. (8 Barber) 62 (1860) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legal title to an intestate's lands, upon his death, descended to and vested in his heirs at law, subject to the widow's dower and the payment of debts through his administrator. Except against the widow's dower, the administrator could, until the debts were all paid, enforce his right to the possession thereof by maintaining or defending an ejectment action. Culberhouse v. Shirey, 42 Ark. 25 (1883) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lands of a decedent were assets in the hands of an executor or administrator and deemed in his possession and subject to his control for the payment of debts of the decedent; the administrator could maintain ejectment to recover possession of lands when necessary for the payment of the debts of the estate without joining the heirs in the suit.

       Before a probate court could acquire jurisdiction to authorize an administrator to mortgage real property, a petition had to show that indebtedness to be paid from proceeds for the loan constituted a lien at the time the intestate died, unless the court order recited that independent evidence was presented showing a jurisdictional fact.

       In an action by an administrator for the possession of lands claimed by his intestate, he could have his right to possession for the purpose of administration determined without the heirs being parties, inasmuch as such actions only affected the mere right to possession between the parties; however, when the title was affected, the heirs were necessary parties.

       Real estate vests in the heirs of a decedent, subject to the widow's dower and to sale for the payment of debts, the preservation or protection of the assets of the estate, the distribution of the estate, or any other purpose in the best interest of the estate; the sale, however, is not necessarily free of the widow's dower, and such a sale is not void for want of jurisdiction, but is simply inoperative as far as the widow's dower is concerned. Keenan v. Peevy, 267 Ark. 218, 590 S.W.2d 259 (1979).

       Intestate's title to realty, irrespective of the extent of her interest, at the moment of her death, vested in her heirs, subject to the payment of her debts; and intestate's administrator, in whom title to the property never did vest, could not maintain suit for partition of land in which intestate held a fractional interest.

       Where an administrator held real estate in her possession as an asset of the estate, collected rents, paid taxes, and kept the property insured, it was error for a chancery court to entertain jurisdiction of a petition for partition filed by one of the heirs.

       Although a probate court had no power to attach property in probate proceedings where the widow appeared in open court and stipulated that she had assigned notes to the estate and agreed to turn them over to the administrator, this action gave the probate court jurisdiction to order that the notes be turned over.

      </p>
      <p>
       A probate court had jurisdiction to determine ownership of money in banks where the administrator voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction and first objected on appeal; if the appellant had not wanted to submit the issue to the probate court, an objection should have been made before a full scale trial was had, and then the appellant could have raised the question on appeal.

       The Supreme Court of Arkansas has recognized certain indicia of fraudulent intent, including insolvency or indebtedness of the transferor, inadequate or fictitious consideration, retention of property by the debtor, the pendency or threat of litigation, secrecy or concealment, and the employment of unusual business practices; transfers to a debtor's family members are particularly suspect.

       A couple's conveyance of substantially all their real and personal property to their children in trust, for nominal consideration, when litigation over substantial tax deficiencies and penalties was pending, exhibited all or virtually all of the indicia of fraud recognized in Arkansas; the claim by the father that he had a heart attack in 1985 and the conveyance was motivated by bona fide estate planning consideration was inadequate to avoid summary judgment in favor of the government under the well established principles of Arkansas fraudulent conveyance law.

       (a)(1)
      </b>
      Unless a testator shall otherwise direct by his or her last will and testament, a personal representative shall have authority to continue any business in which the decedent may have been engaged at the time of death for a period not exceeding one (1) month following the date of the granting of letters of administration without obtaining an order of the court, and, if the business is that of conducting farming operations, he or she may so continue the farming operations for a period of three (3) months or until the end of the calendar year in which the death of the decedent occurred, whichever shall be the longer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Thereafter, upon petition of the personal representative, the court may order the further continuance of the operation of the business, if not a farming operation, by the personal representative for an additional period not to exceed three (3) months, and for an additional period not to exceed one (1) year if it is a farming operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      The petition shall set forth the reasons why the petitioner believes the business should be further continued and a brief financial statement of the operation of the business by the petitioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      The court may from time to time further continue the period during which the business may be so operated. However, no one (1) continuance shall be for a period exceeding three (3) months if a non-farming operation or one (1) year for a farming operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)

      The personal representative shall not have the authority to bind the estate beyond the last period during which the business was authorized to be continued.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      The estate, but not the personal representative personally, shall be liable for damages resulting from torts or other acts committed by agents and employees of the estate in the course of their employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      It is specifically recognized that the operation of any business undertaking involves hazard, chance, and danger of loss. In recognition of this fact, it is declared to be the legislative intent that no personal representative shall be held personally liable for loss resulting from mere lack of familiarity with the business operations, mistake of judgment made in good faith, or like causes.

       The legislative intention of this section is to require assertion of all claims against a decedent's estate, including those sounding in tort, within the period prescribed. Wolfe v. Herndon, 234 Ark. 543, 353 S.W.2d 540 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this section's requirements in filing of claims against estates is to effect and facilitate the payment of just claims against the estate within the specified time and not to defeat a just claim on a technicality that might entrap the claimant. Jones v. Arkansas Farmers Ass'n, 232 Ark. 186, 334 S.W.2d 887 (1960); Parham v. Pelegrin, 468 F.2d 719 (8th Cir. 1972); Moore v. Moore, 21 Ark. App. 165, 731 S.W.2d 215 (1987).

Boehler v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 290 F. Supp. 867 (E.D. Ark. 1968). But see Heiss v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 250 Ark. 474, 465 S.W.2d 699 (1971).

       In an action by an executor for damages sustained by the decedent in an automobile accident between decedent and defendant where defendant filed a cross-complaint for damages against estate, the fact that the guardian ad litem of the defendant was not appointed in strict compliance with the applicable statute was of no consequence since there is no savings clause in favor of infants in the statute of nonclaim; therefore, it was incumbent upon defendant to present his claim in compliance with this section by filing a copy of the cross-complaint with the probate court.

       Under the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, an insurance company which insures a deceased tortfeasor is the only party financially interested in the outcome of the case, since, although the estate is the named defendant, it is not financially liable under the statute; therefore, the peculiar nature of the statute, in effect, confers an unconditional right to intervene on the insurance carrier under ARCP 24(a), and the insurance carrier is entitled to notice of the proceedings.

       Circuit court erred when it held that a father's claim was barred by the statute of nonclaim, subsections (a) and (f) of this section; because the father was a known or reasonably ascertainable creditor within the nonclaim period and did not receive actual notice of the nonclaim deadline, subsection (h) of this section extended the nonclaim period for two years.

       Where for many years a landlord advanced a decedent money and supplies for cultivation of land and in addition to the landlord's lien he also had two mortgages as security, the court held that none of the indebtedness of the decedent to the landlord was barred by the statute of limitation, because no limitation had run before decedent's death, there was nothing to show any holding adverse to landlord's mortgages, and there had been no administration on the estate of decedent; therefore the landlord was entitled to foreclose his mortgages for whatever amount the decedent owed him at the time of his death, less whatever amounts the decedent's children had paid on the indebtedness. Goins v. Sneed, 229 Ark. 550, 317 S.W.2d 269 (1958).

       Claim of a passenger's administrator against a pilot's estate arising out of the wrongful death of the passenger was in substantial compliance with this section because it did provide reasonable notice and relevant information to a pilot's administrator of a wrongful death action and allowed the pilot's administrator to make an informed decision. Attached to the claim was an order approving the retainer agreement between the passenger's estate and an attorney, which provided that it covered the claim against any insurance company of the pilot and the manufacturer or mechanic of the airplane.

      <p>
       A probate court allowance had the force and dignity of a judgment; but no execution could be issued upon it nor demand made upon the personal representatives until payment was ordered by the court; and the court must not order payment until it first ascertained all the debts of its class and those having precedence and the amount of the assets.

      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court was not justified in striking a claim where, due to recitation of the name of the wrong county in caption, the county clerk failed to give notice to an executor as provided by this section, since executor's attorney received a copy of the claim within the statutory period for notice.

       An executor was not entitled to credit for claims against an estate which he paid and which were not verified and approved by the probate court, since statutes with reference to verification and probation of claims were held to be mandatory and a will's direction to pay all just debts did not authorize payment without probate.

       The appearance of an administrator in a probate court on an application for the allowance of a claim against him as administrator and his consent to a continuance were substantive acts dispensing with service of process and making him a party to the cause.

      <p>
       If an administrator appeared and did any substantive act in a cause, before judgment, it would be a waiver of notice. Baskins v. Wylds, 39 Ark. 347 (1882) (decision under prior law).

   Widow's argument that a circuit court erred in allowing a coexecutor of a decedent's estate any fee on his claim against the estate for legal services he provided from 1981 until the decedent's death failed because the widow did not contest the fact that the coexecutor provided the services reflected in his statement and, while the circuit court started with the premise that the coexecutor was to repay the entire amount of his claim, with interest, because the claim was originally paid without court approval, the circuit court then proceeded to consider the claim anew and determined that $10,000 was a reasonable fee for the coexecutor's services to the decedent, under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c50s28-50-105" target="_self">28-50-105</a></cite> and this section.

       As early as Walker v. Byers, 14 Ark. 246 (1853), the Supreme Court held that there was no requirement to file a contingent claim against an estate upon the claim becoming absolute subsequent to the termination of the estate the court held that the creditor could pursue the distributees to the extent of the property received by them. Hall v. Cole, 71 Ark. 601, 76 S.W. 1076 (1903), and Planters' Mut. Ins. Ass'n v. Nelson, 80 Ark. 103, 96 S.W. 123 (1906), also state the rule that equity will enforce contribution out of lands held by the heirs in an action by a contingent creditor whose claim had matured. Numerous decisions of the Supreme Court hold that a contingent creditor may obtain satisfaction out of assets passing to the distributee and remaining in his hands, and several cases specifically hold that the property passing into the hands of an innocent purchaser cannot be reached by the creditor (Wallace v. Swepston, 74 Ark. 520, 86 S.W. 398 (1905)) (decisions under prior law).

      When a claim against the estate has been filed or suit thereon is pending, if it appears to be in the best interest of the estate and subject to the court's authorization or approval, the creditor and personal representative may compromise the claim whether due or not due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated.

       The question in this case is whether, as required by this section, the compromise of claims was in the best interest of the estate. Although certain issues raised by cross-appellant in opposition to the settlement of a claim were issues of first impression that had not been decided in Arkansas (e.g., whether a spouse's election to take against the will triggers a no-contest clause), that uncertainty supported the circuit court's finding that the settlement agreement was in the best interest of the estate. In addition, one of the personal representatives testified that he was carrying out the wishes of his deceased father and that paying the amount in a lump sum was more advantageous than paying it out over 15 years at 6% interest.
   Ashley v. Ashley, 2016 Ark. 161, 489 S.W.3d 660 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent that an agreement settled matters unrelated to the probate of the estate, those claims would not have required the circuit court's approval, and thus settlement of claims beyond the scope of probate would have had no bearing on whether the settlement of probate-related claims was in the best interest of the estate; in addition, cross-appellant did not demonstrate prejudice.
   Ashley v. Ashley, 2016 Ark. 161, 489 S.W.3d 660 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings that cross-appellant challenged as erroneous were not relevant to the question of whether the settlement agreement was in the best interest of the estate, and instead, the findings focused on his knowledge of the agreement; because the findings he complained of were not material to the circuit court's decision on whether the agreement was in the best interest of the estate, he could not demonstrate prejudice.

       The provision of this section abolishing the priority between real and personal property for payment of the debts of the deceased only applies after it has been determined that the lands are necessary for the payment of debts. Cranna v. Long, 225 Ark. 153, 279 S.W.2d 828 (1955); Whitener v. Whitener, 227 Ark. 1038, 304 S.W.2d 260 (1957).

       The charge upon real estate of a decedent for the payment of his debts was held not perpetual, and an application to sell the lands had to be made in a reasonable time, to be determined by the court under the circumstances of the case. A delay of ten years after the grant of administration, without showing any hindrance or proper cause for it, was unreasonable and discharged the lien upon real estate. Mays v. Rogers, 37 Ark. 155 (1881); Stewart v. Smiley, 46 Ark. 373 (1885) (decisions under prior law).
      </p>

      <p>
       The heirs had the right to the real property of an estate unless and until it was necessary to apply it to the payment of debts of the intestate, and it was not within the province of an administrator to construct or complete buildings at the expense of the real estate for which mechanic's liens could be fixed and enforced against it.

       A creditor was entitled to a sale of real estate to pay debt where the administrator testified at a hearing that he had taken charge of no personal property and had never heard that the decedent had any personal property, as the testimony justified a finding of no personal property in the estate.

      In the event the selection of property of the estate to be sold for any of the purposes enumerated in subsection (a) of this section results in a discrimination against the distributees of the property ordered sold, the court, in the distribution of the estate, shall order contribution to be made between the respective distributees in such manner as to equitably distribute the burden of payment of claims and to avoid an infringement of the substantive rights of the distributees of the estate.

       Where an administrator, without compliance with statutes relating to the sale of a decedent's realty for payment of debts, sold realty to an attorney who had prepared the petition for sale and who purchased it for the administrator's wife, and after payment of the widow's share and fee to attorney, the administrator retained the balance as his fee, though no actual fraud appeared to have been contemplated, legal fraud, warranting setting aside the probate court's judgment and the sale resting thereon, was held sufficiently established.

       The right of sale accrued upon the discharge of an administrator and was barred in ten years. Brown v. Hanauer, 48 Ark. 277, 3 S.W. 27 (1886), overruled in part, Price v. Price, 253 Ark. 1124, 491 S.W.2d 793 (1973) (decision under prior law).

       A delay of 20 years after grant of letters of administration before applying for an order of sale to pay probated claims was not unreasonable when the application was made as soon as the widow died. Killough v. Hinton, 54 Ark. 65, 14 S.W. 1092 (1890) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it is an established rule that the right to sell is lost by “gross laches” or “unreasonable delay,” there is no uniform rule for determining what constitutes unreasonable delay or gross negligence. Roth v. Holland, 56 Ark. 633, 20 S.W. 521 (1892) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unnecessary delay for a period of over seven years on the part of a creditor in procuring letters of administration to be issued upon the estate of his debtor was such laches as would defeat an application to sell lands of the estate which had been in the possession of the heirs during that period.

       A delay of more than seven years after the grant of letters of administration before attempting to subject land to payment of debts without other excuse than that the values of real estate were declining was such laches as barred relief even though the administrator, who was one of the heirs, consented to the delay.

       A delay of more than seven years with no other excuse than that the lands were subject to overflow was laches which would bar an application to sell interest of infant heir, but would not bar an action as to interest of an heir who was an administrator during such period and was chiefly responsible for the delay.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A probate court can authorize the mortgage of property held by an estate for the purpose of refinancing a loan to a federal land bank even though this section does not specifically so state, since a court is entitled to authorize the mortgaging of property “for any purpose in the best interest of the estate.” National Bank v. Young, 220 Ark. 498, 248 S.W.2d 375 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the legislature in enacting this section was to extend the power of the probate court to authorize mortgaging of property held by an estate rather than to restrict its authority. National Bank v. Young, 220 Ark. 498, 248 S.W.2d 375 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where an order was entered by the probate court which authorized the executor to borrow funds for purposes which fell within those permissible listed in this section, the mortgaged land became an asset in the hands of the executor and subject to the probate court's jurisdiction under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c49s28-49-101ol1b1" target="_self">28-49-101(b)(1)</a></cite>. Rowland v. Farm Credit Bank, 41 Ark. App. 79, 848 S.W.2d 433 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the court authorized the mortgaging of real estate which was an asset in the hands of the executor, for purposes which were not themselves authorized by statute, it did not serve to oust the court of jurisdiction or to render its order void and subject to collateral attack. Rowland v. Farm Credit Bank, 41 Ark. App. 79, 848 S.W.2d 433 (1993).

      <p>
       When a probate court finds that the real estate of a decedent should be sold for any purpose enumerated in this section, the real estate becomes an asset in the hands of the personal representative and is not subject to the jurisdiction of a court of equity for partition. Doss v. Taylor, 244 Ark. 252, 424 S.W.2d 541 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       A probate court's authority to order a sale does not encompass the power to order a partition, which is preferably accomplished by a division in kind. Gibson v. Gibson, 266 Ark. 622, 589 S.W.2d 1 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court's refusal to hear a real estate agent's testimony was not error where information about the results of a judicial sale versus a private sale was already known to the court, there was other evidence of the client's efforts to sell the property, and thus, the agent's testimony would have added little to the court's deliberations as to whether to order a public sale.

       The fact that creditors petitioning the probate court for the sale of a decedent's land for payment of his debts to them were themselves suing the estate for an undivided half of the lands was no ground for the denial of their petition; however, the court could, in its discretion, suspend the proceedings until the litigation as to the title was ended. Grider v. Apperson & Co., 38 Ark. 388 (1882) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The allowance of a claim by a probate court, the closing of the administration, and the discharge of the administrator without payment laid the foundation for subjecting a decedent's lands in the possession of his heirs to the payment of a claim. Brown v. Hanauer, 48 Ark. 277, 3 S.W. 27 (1886), overruled in part, Price v. Price, 253 Ark. 1124, 491 S.W.2d 793 (1973) (decision under prior law).

       A court properly gave a trustee an opportunity to preserve a trust intact, if reasonably possible, by raising money to pay debts of a decedent's estate. Gaither v. Hobgood, 235 Ark. 777, 362 S.W.2d 18 (1962).

       The death of a decedent fixes a lien upon his lands for the payment of his debts and they pass to his heirs or devisees charged with such debts; and where a creditor's debt has been duly probated and not paid, or has come into existence too late to be probated or after the administration has been closed, he may in equity subject lands in the hands of the heirs or devisees or their alienees to the payment of the debt.

       The claims of creditors of an estate were paramount to those of distributees, and the latter can assert no claims to assets where they are needed to pay creditors. State ex rel. McCreary v. Roth, 47 Ark. 222, 1 S.W. 98 (1886) (decision under prior law).

       Trial court's order to authorize the sale of real estate in probate proceedings was supported by an estate administrator's testimony that the administrator spent the administrator's own funds to keep up the property and that the rental income was not sufficient to pay for all of the necessary repairs and expenses.

But the rule was different where the judgment of the probate court was rendered in a proceeding not in accord with its statutory jurisdiction or according to the course of the common law, but concerning a subject-matter the jurisdiction of which was conferred by special statutes.

       Judgments of the probate court were impervious to collateral attack if they contained the jurisdictional recitals which the general assembly had determined were essential to a valid sale against collateral attack, and private sales made under orders of the court containing jurisdictional recitals of statutory requirements of a valid sale were not void when confirmed and were subject to attack only on direct appeal.

      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      Within ten (10) days after making any sale, mortgage, or lease of real property, the personal representative shall make a verified report to the court of his or her proceeding, with proof of publication or posting in case the sale is made at public auction. The report shall state that the personal representative did not directly or indirectly acquire any beneficial interest in the real property, or the lease thereof, or, if he or she acquired any such interest, specific facts showing that it was acquired in conformity with the provisions of the Probate Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      An interested person may file written objections to the confirmation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)(1)(A)
      </b>
      The court shall examine the report and, if satisfied that the sale, mortgage, or lease has been at a price and on terms advantageous to the estate and in all respects made in conformity with law, shall confirm the sale, mortgage, or lease and order the personal representative to execute and deliver to the person entitled a deed, mortgage, lease, or other appropriate instrument.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      However, no report shall be confirmed within five (5) days after the filing unless all persons interested in the estate, either in person or by attorney or guardian, shall consent in writing to the confirmation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The instrument shall refer to the order of sale, mortgage, or lease by its date and the court by which it was made, shall transfer to the grantee, mortgagee, or lessee all the right, title, and interest of the decedent granted by the instrument, and shall discharge from liability for all debts and obligations incident to the administration of the estate, except encumbrances assumed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      If satisfied that the sale, mortgage, or lease is not advantageous to the estate or has not been made in conformity with law, the court may reject the sale, mortgage, or lease or require a reexecution of the order upon such terms and conditions as it may direct.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)
      </b>
      However, when the order is for private sale, mortgage, or lease, the court may approve the report and confirm the sale immediately, either by endorsement upon the report of sale, mortgage, or lease or by separate order of confirmation. If approval and confirmation is by endorsement upon the report, the report, with endorsement, shall be recorded.

       Under Arkansas' administration system, an executor de son tort was held unknown; it was inconsistent with the policy of the law of administration to hold that any one could make himself the executor of another, and where one intermeddled with the estate of a deceased person, he was responsible to the rightful executor or administrator and not to a creditor.

       Statute speaks in terms of the personal representative's duty to file accountings and possible sanctions for failing to do so, and the trustee was not acting as the personal representative when it filed its first accounting that was deemed improper; because the statute did not apply to this case, there was no authority for the probate court's award of attorney's fees to the heirs.

       In an estate dispute where a sister sued her brother, who had held a power of attorney for the father, this section did not apply to the sister's argument concerning an accounting that the court had directed the brother to file. This section governs accountings filed during the probate of a decedent's estate but this case was not the probate of the father's estate; the probate court handling the estate was the proper forum for the proceeding on the accounting.

       An executor was not entitled to a credit in the annual settlement of his accounts for payments, without an order of the court, to legatees or distributees; such payments were at the peril of the executor and, though valid as between him and the legatee or distributee, were not so as to others having paramount rights in the estate.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The failure of an executor or administrator to present his account annually for settlement, as prescribed by former similar statute, was a breach of the condition of his bond, for which any person interested in the estate could have maintained an action. Scarborough v. State, 24 Ark. (11 Barber) 20 (1862) (decision under prior law).

       When an administrator failed to file an account, he should have been cited and required to file one. Kenyon v. Gregory, 127 Ark. 525, 192 S.W. 887 (1917) (decision under prior law).
      </p>

       Sanction levied against a lawyer, as personal representative of an estate, was proper under subdivision (c)(2) of this section because he failed to timely produce an accounting as ordered by the probate court.

       If an executor or administrator claimed credit in his settlement with the probate court for an illegal expenditure, the court should have rejected it, although it could have previously approved the expenditure and authorized him to take credit for it.

       Where a plaintiff promptly objected to the “first and final report” filed by an administrator, there was no estoppel of the plaintiff because his present pleading was not timely filed, as it was the duty of the administrator to close the estate, and plaintiff, as an interested person, could ask that the personal representative be cited to show cause why the estate could not be closed.

       A bill to open settlements of an executor, charging in general terms that he fraudulently omitted to account for all property mentioned in the inventory, was not sufficiently specific; rather, the facts and circumstances had to be stated with distinctness and precision.

      <p>
       The approval by a probate court of an administrator's settlement was conclusive of the accuracy of every item thereof as against creditors who appeared and contested the settlement, unless they showed facts constituting fraud, which have, with no want of diligence on their part, only come to their knowledge since the approval. Edrington v. Jefferson, 53 Ark. 545, 14 S.W. 99 (1890) (decision under prior law).
      </p>

       An order of a probate court confirming an administrator's settlement was a judgment binding on all persons interested in an estate and conclusive of all matters embraced in such settlement and within the scope of the proceedings. Beckett v. Whittington, 92 Ark. 230, 122 S.W. 633 (1909) (decision under prior law).

       The adjudication of a probate court in confirmation of settlement of executors and administrators had to be regarded as a judgment of a court and was binding and conclusive except for fraud, the only mode of correcting mere errors being by appeal.

       If a probate court should have erroneously determined exceptions to an executor's settlement, an appeal would have been to the Supreme Court for a trial de novo, but prohibition would not lie. Gocio v. Seamster, 203 Ark. 937, 160 S.W.2d 194 (1942) (decision under prior law).

       Chancery courts could correct any fraud in the settlements of executors and administrators, and when that was done, if there was a necessity for further proceedings, they should have been had in the probate court. Reinhardt v. Gartrell, 33 Ark. 727 (1878) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court of equity had the power to vacate allowances to administrators obtained by fraud, accident, or mistake in their settlements in a probate court, but none to correct mere errors in allowances. Jones v. Graham, 36 Ark. 383 (1880); Greely Burnham Grocery Co. v. Graves, 43 Ark. 171 (1884) (decisions under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of a chancery court was limited to the review of items in the settlement specifically charged to be fraudulent, but this jurisdiction could be enlarged by consent to the parties to include any and all frauds without regard to the specific allegations in the complaint. McLeod v. Griffis, 45 Ark. 505 (1885) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A probate court had no power to relieve against the fraud of an administrator in buying in the lands of the estate at the sale, as equity alone could grant relief. Hankins v. Layne, 48 Ark. 544, 3 S.W. 821 (1887) (decision under prior law).

       The discharge of an administrator by a probate court was only for so much of the funds belonging to the estate as was found by his settlement to be in his hands; he would still have been liable for funds received and not accounted for.

       If an administrator charged himself in settlement with the appraised value of an estate, while the sale bill returned by him showed the amount for which the property sold exceeded its appraised value, or if he applied the money of the estate to the purchase of property in his own name, the court of chancery would open the settlement for fraud. Osborne v. Graham, 30 Ark. 66 (1875) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an administrator's credits might have been fraudulent in law, if there was no actual fraud, there was no relief in equity unless there had been injury also. Trimble v. James, 40 Ark. 393 (1883) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was fraud in an administrator to obtain an allowance for himself for the whole of a claim assigned to him when his assignor was indebted to the estate without deducting the debt. Sorrels v. Trantham, 48 Ark. 386, 3 S.W. 198, 4 S.W. 281 (1887) (decision under prior law).

       When an administrator became interested in a sale by her as the administrator of lands to pay debts, after the sale but before confirmation, the sale was voidable at instance of the heirs without showing actual fraud.

       An order of a probate court overruling an executor's motion to quash exceptions to his settlement, indicating that court would not try questions of disputed title to realty but would continue hearing on executor's report until those questions were determined in the proper forum, did not justify assumption that probate court would exceed its jurisdiction in the matter so as to authorize granting of a writ of prohibition.

        Continuing Duty.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The duty of a personal representative to account is a continuing one, not subject to the statute of limitations, until such time as he is finally discharged and final distribution approved. Where the proceeding is still pending in a probate court, the original objections and exceptions of a plaintiff will be considered as continuing as long as the purported account filed has not been approved, and a lapse of time between the filing of the plaintiff's objections and petition to cite him to render an accounting would not be a sufficient basis for estoppel. Price v. Price, 253 Ark. 1124, 491 S.W.2d 793 (1973).

       In a proceeding by a person claiming to be the illegitimate daughter of a decedent, born at time her mother was legally married, it would be necessary to show that her mother's husband was impotent or that he had no access to her mother; however, the testimony of the mother could not be used to show such nonaccess.

       Probate court had jurisdiction to set aside its previous order determining heirship, because there was an extended period during which courts had jurisdiction to modify or vacate orders in probate proceedings, there had not been a final termination of the proceedings, and it was not entirely clear that the order determining heirship would have ended the proceedings.

   Where a petition for determination of heirship under this section was filed in July 1980, and the executor filed his response in September 1980, beyond the 20-day period provided for in ARCP 12, but before the hearing, it was proper for the probate judge to deny petitioner's motion to strike the response, since objections by the defendant are not governed by Rule 12 in probate proceedings and may be made at any time, up to and including the day of the hearing, unless a special order or general rule of the court under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-110" target="_self">28-1-110</a></cite> requires a written objection as a prerequisite to the arguments being heard by the court.

   Probate court erred in finding that the limited liability company lacked standing to bring a petition for the determination of heirship, because the limited liability company alleged in the petition that it was a legal entity, so it was a person and could bring the petition; “person” was defined under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-102ol118" target="_self">28-1-102(18)</a></cite> to include a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity.

       Distribution previously made or to be made was approved and the executor and his sureties were released and discharged from their trust and any and all liability or accountability thereunder; nothing in the court's statement discharging the executor indicated that the discharge was subject to a lawsuit being filed.

       Circuit court did not err in granting a medical center, doctors, and an insurer summary judgment in an executrix's wrongful death/malpractice action because the executrix had no standing to file a lawsuit on behalf of the estate since the probate court had closed the estate and discharged her; there was substantial compliance with this section, and the order closing the estate was effective, because although that order did not expressly discharge the executrix or approve a final distribution, it authorized her to execute an executrix's deed to convey the decedent's property in accordance with her wishes, and since the heirs had waived the final accounting, there was nothing more for the executrix to do as the personal representative of the estate unless a wrongful-death action was filed within the period limited by the circuit court.

   Former attorney's appeal from a probate court's order striking the former attorney's response to a motion for modification and declaratory judgment and discovery requests was dismissed with prejudice because (1) the order striking the response was the only issue raised on appeal, (2) the order striking the response was an appealable order, under Ark.

       The duty of a personal representative to account is a continuing one, not subject to the statute of limitations, until such time as he is finally discharged and final distribution approved. Where the proceeding is still pending in a probate court, the original objections and exceptions of a plaintiff will be considered as continuing as long as the purported account filed has not been approved, and a lapse of time between the filing of the plaintiff's objections and the petition to cite him to render an accounting would not be a sufficient basis for estoppel.

      If, upon the filing of a petition for an order of final distribution, it appears that any distributee of the estate cannot be found, or for any reason the personal representative is unable to deliver to a distributee his or her distributable share of the estate and obtain a receipt therefor, the court may order the personal representative to sell the nonliquid assets distributable to the distributee, in the manner authorized by the provisions of the Probate Code for the sale of the property by a personal representative, and to deposit in the registry of the court, by payment to the clerk of the court, the funds distributable to the distributee.

       Where legatees' petition to reopen administration alleged that the administrator was not legally appointed, that she did not qualify for letters testamentary, although the will was admitted to probate, that they received no notice of the filing of accounting, or hearing thereon, and that the administrator, who claimed all of the proceeds of the estate, had a personal interest which conflicted with her official duties, such facts were sufficient to require the taking of proof.

   Probate court did not err in reopening a decedent's estate in order to reform the probate file and a deed to show that real property was conveyed to purchasers with a reservation of one-half the mineral rights on each tract of land because the president of the bank that administered the estate testified that one-half of the mineral rights were not to be sold to purchasers, and his testimony was supported by the notice of sale, the installment note signed by the purchasers, the certificate of purchase, and two deeds, one reserving one-half the mineral rights in each tract and the other conveying one-half the mineral rights to a church; §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-115" target="_self">28-1-115</a></cite> was inapplicable and did not limit this section because §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-115" target="_self">28-1-115</a></cite> did not speak to reopening the estate, which was authorized by this section.

       Where a son who exercised an option to purchase a decedent's real property paid less than the amount required by the decedent's will, the estate was properly reopened pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for the limited purpose of allowing the personal representative to collect the deficiency from the son, as opposed to permitting rescission of the deed, because the personal representative had an adequate remedy at law and the amount of damages was readily ascertainable.

       Probate division of the circuit court had the authority under this section to appoint a special administrator for the limited purpose of pursuing unliquidated tort claims that were not addressed before the estate of the special administrator's parent was closed. Although the circuit court did not use the word “reopen” in its order, its intent was clear enough because it found that the decedent's estate was opened and closed without resolving wrongful death or survival claims and that a special administrator was necessary to pursue the claims.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby deemed to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1987, No. 643, § 5: Apr. 4, 1987. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Arkansas General Assembly that existing statutes concerning transfers of assets from decedents' estates at values referencing federal estate tax values may not be sufficient to preserve the estate tax marital deduction under potential challenges by the Internal Revenue Service where the nonmarital share of the estate is transferred to a pecuniary credit shelter trust and the marital share for the benefit of the surviving spouse consists of the residue of the estate (or trust) assets. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully adhered to such a position, the resulting loss of the marital deduction would bring about substantial estate tax costs, thereby placing an undue burden upon the families of decedents owning farms and family businesses. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall take effect and be in force from the date of its approval.”

     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      “Apportionable estate” means the value of the gross estate as finally determined for purposes of the estate tax to be apportioned reduced by:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      any claim or expense allowable as a deduction for purposes of the tax;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      the value of any interest in property that, for purposes of the tax, qualifies for a marital or charitable deduction or otherwise is deductible or is exempt; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      any amount added to the decedent's gross estate because of a gift tax on transfers made before death.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      “Estate tax” means a federal, state, or foreign tax imposed because of the death of an individual and interest and penalties associated with the tax. The term does not include an inheritance tax, income tax, or generation-skipping transfer tax other than a generation-skipping transfer tax incurred on a direct skip taking effect at death.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      “Gross estate” means, with respect to an estate tax, all interests in property subject to the tax.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      “Person” means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, public corporation, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, or any other legal or commercial entity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      “Ratable” means apportioned or allocated pro rata according to the relative values of interests to which the term is to be applied. “Ratably” has a corresponding meaning.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      “Time-limited interest” means an interest in property which terminates on a lapse of time or on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or which is subject to the exercise of discretion that could transfer a beneficial interest to another person. The term does not include a cotenancy unless the cotenancy itself is a time-limited interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (7)
      </b>
      “Value” means, with respect to an interest in property, fair market value as finally determined for purposes of the estate tax that is to be apportioned, reduced by any outstanding debt secured by the interest without reduction for taxes paid or required to be paid or for any special valuation adjustment.

      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      To the extent that a provision of a decedent's will expressly and unambiguously directs the apportionment of an estate tax, the tax must be apportioned accordingly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Any portion of an estate tax not apportioned pursuant to paragraph (1) must be apportioned in accordance with any provision of a revocable trust of which the decedent was the settlor which expressly and unambiguously directs the apportionment of an estate tax. If conflicting apportionment provisions appear in two or more revocable trust instruments, the provision in the most recently dated instrument prevails. For purposes of this paragraph:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      a trust is revocable if it was revocable immediately after the trust instrument was executed, even if the trust subsequently becomes irrevocable; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      the date of an amendment to a revocable trust instrument is the date of the amended instrument only if the amendment contains an apportionment provision.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If any portion of an estate tax is not apportioned pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), and a provision in any other dispositive instrument expressly and unambiguously directs that any interest in the property disposed of by the instrument is or is not to be applied to the payment of the estate tax attributable to the interest disposed of by the instrument, the provision controls the apportionment of the tax to that interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Subject to subsection (c), and unless the decedent expressly and unambiguously directs the contrary, the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      If an apportionment provision directs that a person receiving an interest in property under an instrument is to be exonerated from the responsibility to pay an estate tax that would otherwise be apportioned to the interest,
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      the tax attributable to the exonerated interest must be apportioned among the other persons receiving interests passing under the instrument, or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      if the values of the other interests are less than the tax attributable to the exonerated interest, the deficiency must be apportioned ratably among the other persons receiving interests in the apportionable estate that are not exonerated from apportionment of the tax.
     </p>
     <p>

If the estate tax initially apportioned to the holder of an interest in specified property is reduced to zero, any excess amount of reduction reduces ratably the estate tax apportioned to other persons that receive interests in the apportionable estate.

     Acts 1985, No. 940, § 1, provided that Acts 1983, No. 345, impliedly repealed several sections of the Arkansas Guardianship Law and provided that, because Acts 1983, No. 345, went beyond the purposes for which it was presented to the General Assembly, it was determined that it would be in the best interests of the people of this state that Acts 1983, No. 345, be repealed and the provisions of the previous guardianship law be, in essence, reenacted, with amendments.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that considerable doubt and confusion has been cast on various guardianships established during the period from the effective date of Act 345 of 1983 until the effective date of Act 940 of 1985 due to the fact that the provisions of Act 345 of 1983 were unclear with respect to the repeal of various other laws relating to guardianships; that it is urgent that such doubt be removed at the earliest possible date in order that guardians appointed during that period can proceed to carry out their official responsibilities and to thereby accomplish the purposes for which the guardianships were established; that this Act is designed to remove this doubt and specifically validate all such guardianships and should be given effect immediately. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

       Failure to obtain a professional evaluation prior to a hearing on the appointment of a guardian was clearly erroneous; there was no oral testimony or a sworn written statement of a qualified professional. Without the required professional examination, there was insufficient evidence of the need for a guardian.

       Trial court did not err in determining that an original guardianship order was simply voidable rather than void ab initio; while the original petition failed to meet the statutory requirements for obtaining a guardianship, such as those in subdivision (8) of this section, the petition's deficiencies did not strip the court of jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter.

     <p>
      <b>
       (f)(1)(A)
      </b>
      It is found and determined by the General Assembly that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (i)
      </b>
      Act 345 of 1983 [repealed] governing guardianships for incapacitated persons created considerable confusion concerning various other laws relating to the appointment of guardians;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (ii)
      </b>
      Part of that confusion was due to uncertainty as to whether Act 345 of 1983 [repealed], was intended to repeal or supersede various other laws relating to guardianship;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (iii)
      </b>
      As a result of this confusion, guardianships were established by various courts in the state under the provisions of various laws which were in effect concurrently with or immediately prior to Act 345 of 1983 [repealed], and there is now some question concerning the validity of some of those guardianships; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (iv)
      </b>
      This confusion and doubt should be removed in order that guardians appointed during that period can continue to carry out their responsibilities without the doubt and disagreement concerning their official capacity and authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      It is therefore the intent and purpose of this subsection to validate any and all guardianships established from July 4, 1983, until June 28, 1985, under authority of Act 345 of 1983 [repealed] or any law in effect concurrently with or immediately prior to July 4, 1983.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (2)
   
   Any guardianship established during the period from July 4, 1983, to June 28, 1985, whether established under Act 345 of 1983 [repealed], or under any act in effect concurrently with Act 345 of 1983 [repealed], or any act in effect immediately prior to July 4, 1983, is declared to be valid and shall continue in effect for the purposes established. However, the provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to all guardianships so established except as otherwise provided in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-102" target="_self">28-65-102</a></cite>.

       In light of the public policy favoring arbitration and the Legislature's decision to refrain from specifically limiting a guardian's ability to enter into arbitration agreements, a guardian of a patient's person and the patient's estate possessed the authority to enter into an arbitration agreement with a nursing home on behalf of the patient; therefore, the nursing home's motion to compel arbitration should have been granted.

       Failure to obtain a professional evaluation prior to a hearing on the appointment of a guardian was clearly erroneous; there was no oral testimony or a sworn written statement of a qualified professional.

       The jurisdiction of a probate court in guardianship matters was limited to guardians and persons of unsound mind and their estates as vested in courts of probate at the time of the adoption of Ark. Const., Amend. 24, Art. 7, § 34, or as thereafter prescribed by law. Keenan v. Peevy, 267 Ark. 218, 590 S.W.2d 259 (1979) (decision under prior law).

   The circuit court's power to review and conclude, subject to appeal, whether the money is “accessible”, under whatever state or federal regulations may apply, does not mean that the circuit court has the authority to determine how a guardian is to use a ward's funds; that decision lies exclusively within the jurisdiction of the probate court according to subsection (a) of this section. Another section, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-310ol1c3" target="_self">28-65-310(c)(3)</a></cite>, deals with the probate court's authority to invade the principal of a minor ward's estate to provide for support.

      Acts 1987, No. 535, § 3: Apr. 1, 1987. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the Arkansas Supreme Court recently invalidated Arkansas' Temporary Guardianship Law; that this Act is designed to meet the court's objections to the previous law; that until this Act goes into effect, there will be no Temporary Guardianship Law; and that a temporary guardianship law is immediately necessary in order to adequately protect incapacitated persons. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1991, No. 11, § 5: Feb. 1, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that in appointing a guardian for a minor child the court should give due regard to any written instrument executed by the legal custodian of the minor child; and this act is immediately necessary to insure that an appropriate guardian is appointed for a minor child. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1993, No. 1295, § 5: Apr. 22, 1993. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Ninth General Assembly that the existing temporary guardianship statute does not provide for notice to parents of minors for whom temporary guardianships have been appointed; that the constitutionality of such existing law has been drawn into question by decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that there is an urgent need to insure that the law provides due process to parents of minors for whom temporary guardians are appointed. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in full force and effect from the date of its passage and approval.”

       The Supreme Court declined to adopt a proposal granting a probate judge jurisdiction to appoint a trustee for a lawyer who was disabled, deceased, or had disappeared, since this proposal would have clearly conflicted with the statutory scheme for establishing a guardianship for an incompetent attorney as well as the statutory scheme for decedent's estates under former similar statutes and since there were express statutes which conflicted with the proposal for attorneys who had disappeared.

      <p>
       As a general rule, it may be stated that, in order to have that measure of capacity required by law to be of sound mind, a person must have capacity enough to comprehend and understand the nature and effect of the business he is doing; and where it is clearly made to appear that the mental capacity and imbecility is of such a degree as to render the person unable to conduct the ordinary affairs of life and leaves him in a condition to be the victim of his infirmity, then such person is in contemplation of law not of sound mind. Weakness of understanding is not alone sufficient to show mental unsoundness if capacity remains to see things in their true relations and where the individual has a moderate comprehension of his immediate duties and of the value and use of his property.

       Denial of paternal grandmother's petition for guardianship was affirmed because the grandmother did not meet the qualifications under subsection (a) of this section in that she failed to establish that she was not a convicted and unpardoned felon. Bailey v. Maxwell, 94 Ark. App. 358, 230 S.W.3d 282 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court properly appointed an incapacitated person's brother, rather than her daughter, to be her guardian as the two had a loving brother and sister bond, they had a long history of working well in a business enterprise, and the brother had been a constant in the incapacitated person's life and had helped in providing for her care; further, the daughter had a long period of estrangement from her mother precipitated by her absconding to California with $46,000 of her mother's money and, after she reentered her mother's life, she made it difficult for others to see her mother and made unfounded accusations of theft.

      <p>
       <p>
   Circuit court did not err in appointing a sister as guardian over her sibling, an incapacitated adult, without holding a hearing to determine the sister's qualifications or making specific factual findings regarding her suitability because the record did not indicate that the circuit court ever refused any request by the brother to hold an evidentiary hearing or issue findings of fact; nothing in this section mandates a hearing or specific factual findings on the question of a guardian's ability to serve, and no such requirements are set forth in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-210" target="_self">28-65-210</a></cite> .

       The custody of a child was not awarded to gratify the feelings of either parent or with the idea of punishment or reward, but only from considerations for the best interests of the child. Page v. Page, 210 Ark. 430, 196 S.W.2d 580 (1946) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The harmful effect to young children of frequent changes in surroundings and environment could be entitled to controlling weight when, from the evidence, there is doubt as to what order should be made. Page v. Page, 210 Ark. 430, 196 S.W.2d 580 (1946) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former statute did not make an ironclad order of priority where there was a dispute between relatives. It left it to the court to select that person as guardian, the appointment of whom would be for the best interests of the incompetent. McCartney v. Merchants & Planters Bank, 227 Ark. 80, 296 S.W.2d 407 (1956) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since former statute gave no ironclad order of preference, a probate court did not abuse its discretion in the appointment of a bank as guardian of the person and estate of an incompetent, having in mind the best interests of the ward, in view of a sharp dispute between relatives. McCartney v. Merchants & Planters Bank, 227 Ark. 80, 296 S.W.2d 407 (1956) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       A reading of former similar statute indicated that parental preference was only one of many factors to be considered in determining the one most suitable to serve as guardian. The statute did not make an ironclad order of priority; instead, it left to the probate court's sound discretion the appointment of a guardian who would forward the best interests of the ward. Monroe v. Dallas, 6 Ark. App. 10, 636 S.W.2d 881 (1982) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former similar statute was couched in such terms as to allow a court to exercise its sound discretion and only granted a preference to the parents of a minor. Any inclination to appoint a relative as guardian of a minor child had to necessarily become subservient to the principle that the child's interest was of paramount consideration; the court needed only give due regard to those factors listed in the statute. Bennett v. McGough, 281 Ark. 414, 664 S.W.2d 476 (1984) (decision under prior law).

       Circuit court did not err in awarding guardianship in favor of the maternal grandparents over the biological father where the father never had custody and it was in the child's best interests to remain with his grandparents. Freeman v. Rushton, 360 Ark. 445, 202 S.W.3d 485 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where maternal grandparents were appointed guardians of their grandson after the mother's death, the father's petition to terminate the guardianship was properly denied because (1) some of the father's testimony was found to be not credible and the father had a smoking habit and a previous domestic-battery incident, and (2) the statutory natural-parent preference under subsection (a) of this section was subservient to the best interest of the child.
   Smith v. Thomas, 373 Ark. 427, 284 S.W.3d 476 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order appointing appellee guardian of the minor child was affirmed because, in guardianship matters, the natural-parent preference was but one consideration, which was subservient to the principle that the child's best interest was the paramount consideration.

       In guardianship proceedings for a child, a trial court's findings under subsection (a) of this section that an adoptive father was not qualified and suitable and staying in the adoptive father's custody would not be in the child's best interest were not clearly erroneous, as the adoptive father had never been the child's primary caregiver and had a long history of drug abuse.

Even though the mother had ended the relationship and completed classes and counseling, the natural-parent preference was merely one facet of the case, and the mother was unable to provide for the emotional needs of the children.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in finding that a ward's daughter was not a suitable guardian under subsection (b) of this section because, although they might have been close at one time, the ward was no longer close to the daughter and accused her of “playing games;” the ward was angry that the daughter did not attend her husband's funeral and that she was forced to return to Florida against her wishes.
   Johnson v. Mitchell, 2013 Ark. App. 498 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was evidence to support the appointment of a guardian because it was not in the best interest of the child to be returned to a home where she did not feel safe; the mother disbelieved that the child had been sexually abused and chose her relationship with her boyfriend over her relationship with the child.

       A chancellor, in awarding the custody of an infant or in modifying such an award subsequently, must keep in view the welfare of the child and should confide his custody to the parent most suitable therefor, the right of each parent to his custody being of equal dignity.

       The preference found in this section does not automatically attach to a child's natural parent; only a natural parent who is both qualified and, in the opinion of the probate court, suitable must be preferred over all others to be the child's guardian.

      </p>
      <p>
       Paternal grandmother was not appointed the guardian of her grandchild because the mother was preferred under subsection (a) of this section, and a trial court did not find that the mother was unfit; evidence regarding the mother's shortcomings was largely controverted, and the trial court considered allegations that the mother had been deceptive to healthcare providers. Even though the mother's sexual relationships could have had a significant effect on the children in the household, the mother was married at the time of a final hearing.
   Marcellus v. Mays, 2012 Ark. App. 304, 419 S.W.3d 730 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       In awarding permanent guardianship of a child to her paternal grandfather and step-grandmother, a court specifically addressed the suitability of the natural parents to be guardians over the child pursuant to subsection (a) of this section; an impediment to the mother being considered a qualified and suitable guardian was her relationship with the child's father.

      </p>
      <p>
       In appointing a guardian, a trial court did not err by failing to consider a mother's fitness as a parent under the current interpretation of Arkansas guardianship laws. Even assuming that a finding on fitness was required, the evidence would have supported a finding that the mother was unfit based on her disbelief that her child had been sexually abused.

      <p>
       Trial court's decision to appoint the grandparents as guardians was clearly erroneous where the evidence did not support a finding that the mother was an unfit parent; despite the fact that the grandparents may be able to provide certain advantages to the children, the mother should not be deprived of custody. Moore v. Sipes, 85 Ark. App. 15, 146 S.W.3d 903 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court properly appointed an incapacitated person's brother, rather than her daughter, to be her guardian as the two had a loving brother and sister bond, they had a long history of working well in a business enterprise, and the brother had been a constant in the incapacitated person's life and had helped in providing for her care; further, the daughter had a long period of estrangement from her mother precipitated by her absconding to California with $46,000 of her mother's money and, after she reentered her mother's life, she made it difficult for others to see her mother and made unfounded accusations of theft.

   Trial court properly found it was in a child's best interests to appoint a paternal aunt and uncle as guardians, in accordance with §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-210" target="_self">28-65-210</a></cite>, rather than the maternal grandfather, because even though both parties satisfied the preferential status under subdivision (b)(4) of this section, any preferential status was subservient to the best interests analysis performed by the trial court; although the father was not qualified to be the guardian, the father wanted the child placed with the aunt and uncle.

   Order appointing the mother's aunt and uncle guardian of the minor child was proper because the father's parents did not have standing to argue that the trial court erred in denying the father's motion to vacate; a U.S. Const. Amend. VI right to counsel was not cognizable in ordinary civil cases; §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-207ol1a3" target="_self">28-65-207(a)(3)</a></cite> provided that notice need not be given to any person who actually appeared at the hearing; and there was no evidence that the trial court ignored the father's wishes, as required by subsection (b) of this section.
   Light v. Duvall, 2011 Ark. App. 535, 385 S.W.3d 399 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the aunt and uncle's petition for guardianship over the minor children was improper under subsection (a) of this section because the children would be required to primarily reside in the same residence with a man who pled guilty to inflicting severe burns on the younger of them, and with their mother who, at the very least, did nothing to prevent the abuse despite evidence that other instances of abuse had occurred.
   Gammill v. Hoover, 2011 Ark. App. 788 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) of this section, the natural parent preference statute, did not require a grandmother seeking custody of her grandchildren to prove that the children's natural mother was an unfit mother. The best interest of the children was served by placement with their grandmother, given evidence that the children were dirty, flea-bitten, and injured when they returned from their mother's home.
   Furr v. James, 2013 Ark. App. 181, 427 S.W.3d 94 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the statutory preference for a parent, a grandparent was appointed as a guardian since the trial court was not satisfied that the mother was suitable; the trial court noted the mother's “voiced skepticism” with respect to allegations of sexual abuse in clear contradiction of the child's counselor, her continued significant social contact with the alleged perpetrator, and a lack of stability in the mother's life and home.
   Sherland v. Sherland, 2015 Ark. App. 342, 465 S.W.3d 3 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly awarded the grandmother's petition for guardianship because the grandmother was not required to prove that the mother was unfit; there was a mountain of evidence presented in the case to demonstrate that the mother was unsuitable, and the circuit court found that the mother poisoned the minds of the children and and coached them to make untrue statements.

   Order appointing the mother's aunt and uncle guardian of the minor child was proper because the father's parents did not have standing to argue that the trial court erred in denying the father's motion to vacate; a U.S. Const.

       If a trial court exercised its discretion at an insanity hearing and barred an alleged incompetent from courtroom during part of the hearing, any abuse of such discretion was merely an error in exercise of jurisdiction, corrected only by appeal, and was not ground for granting a writ of injunction from further proceeding on a petition by the alleged incompetent.

       Denial of paternal grandmother's petition for guardianship was affirmed as the grandmother was unsuitable because she had been dishonest with the court. Bailey v. Maxwell, 94 Ark. App. 358, 230 S.W.3d 282 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a guardianship case that awarded permanent guardianship to the grandparents, the mother took significant action towards rectifying any issues that would keep her from retaining custody of her son, including (1) maintaining a neat, clean, and appropriately furnished home; (2) taking steps to remedy most of the absence and tardiness issues by applying to an elementary school closer to her home and no longer working nights; (3) immediately and permanently removing wall art that could be deemed inappropriate and were an issue regarding her ability to care for her son; and (4) decreasing her Internet presence by removing most of the pictures of her from the offending websites; those were the very types of improvements that parents were encouraged to make in the best interests of their child, and the mother should not be disparaged for her efforts to improve her home and her parenting skills. Thus, it was not in the child's best interests to take custody from the mother, who had rectified all issues related to her fitness, and grant custody to the child's grandparents; therefore, the circuit court clearly erred in removing the child from the mother's care and granting permanent guardianship to the grandparents.

   Where maternal grandparents were appointed guardians of their grandson after the mother's death, the father's petition to terminate the guardianship was properly denied because (1) some of the father's testimony was found to be not credible and the father had a smoking habit and a previous domestic-battery incident, and (2) the statutory natural-parent preference under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-204ol1a" target="_self">28-65-204(a)</a></cite> was subservient to the best interest of the child.

       Order appointing appellee guardian of the minor child was affirmed because, in guardianship matters, the natural-parent preference was but one consideration, which was subservient to the principle that the child's best interest was the paramount consideration; the circuit court was in a superior position to weigh and assess the credibility of witnesses,

   Trial court properly found it was in a child's best interests to appoint a paternal aunt and uncle as guardians, in accordance with this section, rather than the maternal grandfather, because even though both parties satisfied the preferential status under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-204ol1b4" target="_self">28-65-204(b)(4)</a></cite>, any preferential status was subservient to the best interests analysis performed by the trial court; although the father was not qualified to be the guardian, the father wanted the child placed with the aunt and uncle.

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the aunt and uncle's petition for guardianship over the minor children was improper because the children would be required to primarily reside in the same residence with a man who pled guilty to inflicting severe burns on the younger of them, and with their mother who, at the very least, did nothing to prevent the abuse despite evidence that other instances of abuse had occurred.
   Gammill v. Hoover, 2011 Ark. App. 788 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Aunt was properly appointed as the guardian of two children under this section where it was in the best interest of the children in order to protect them from the effects of their mother's abusive relationship, and the aunt was qualified and suitable to act as the guardian. Even though the mother had ended the relationship and completed classes and counseling, the natural-parent preference was merely one facet of the case, and the mother was unable to provide for the emotional needs of the children.
   Gantt v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 2013 Ark. App. 217 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence showed a long-standing and positive relationship between the child and the couple, who had spent quality time with the child for years, and a strong bond existed between them; the mother took little action to establish her fitness to parent the child, the circuit court's best-interest finding was not clearly erroneous, and the three statutory requirements for guardianship had been met in this case.

      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the contentions of a child's grandparents that appellee failed to establish that she was qualified or suitable to act as the child's guardian, the appellate court concluded there was ample evidence before the circuit court that appellee was qualified and suitable to serve as guardian. The circuit court's finding that appellee would be the better person to parent the child was supported, and the appellate court was not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake had been made.

       Where an incompetent brought a guardianship termination proceeding in which she requested the trial court to adjudicate and restore her competency and the evidence clearly established that the plaintiff was competent to care for herself and her home and had done so for the previous 12 years, the trial court erred in refusing to grant her request because there was no evidence that she suffered from the requisite mental incapacity or unsoundness of mind required to necessitate the appointment of a guardian, notwithstanding the fact that she was unable to properly manage her finances due to her inexperience in such matters.

       The evaluation set forth in this section is not required to be in writing, but in determining a person's incapacity the court must require that the evidence of incapacity include the oral testimony or sworn written statement of one or more qualified professionals. In re Bailey, 299 Ark. 352, 771 S.W.2d 779 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding of incapacity was clearly erroneous because it did not satisfy the requirements of subsection (b). In re Bailey, 299 Ark. 352, 771 S.W.2d 779 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court's finding of incapacity was clearly erroneous because there was no oral testimony or sworn written statement of a qualified professional as required by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-211ol1b1" target="_self">28-65-211(b)(1)</a></cite> of this section, and the medical evaluations did not establish findings with respect to adaptive behavior. Cogburn v. Wolfenbarger, 85 Ark. App. 206, 148 S.W.3d 787 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to obtain a professional evaluation prior to a hearing on the appointment of a guardian was clearly erroneous; there was no oral testimony or a sworn written statement of a qualified professional. Without the required professional examination, there was insufficient evidence of the need for a guardian.

      <p>
       Pursuant to the invited-error doctrine, a guardian was precluded from arguing that a guardianship was void because it was the guardian who requested the guardianship and who failed to obtain the requisite professional evaluation; the guardian defended the validity of the guardianship when trustees attempted to have it set aside.

       In a guardianship case, an appellate court was able to review whether a circuit court erred by failing to obtain a professional evaluation prior to hearing, even though the argument was not raised below; moreover, the sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial could have been raised whether or not an objection was made below.

       Whether petitioner for guardianship over her mother had fully complied with the statutory requirements concerning the professional evaluation was not a jurisdictional issue; therefore, because the mother had failed to raise the issue or obtain a ruling, the appellate court did not address the issue in her interlocutory appeal.

       Award of final guardianship of the adult appellant to his mother and her husband was inappropriate, where a physician's affidavit attached to the emergency petition established, at best, appellant's medical and physical condition, adaptive behavior, and intellectual functioning, but did not contain any recommendation as to the specific areas for which assistance was needed and the least restrictive alternatives available as required by subdivision (b)(4) of this section.

       In a case where no bond was ever set and no letters of guardianship were ever issued, the Probate Code of 1949 did not authorize insurance company to pay guardian the proceeds on the strength of a court order conditionally appointing him guardian, with bond yet to be determined, there was no error in the chancellor's ruling that insurance proceeds were improperly paid. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Frazier, 323 Ark. 311, 914 S.W.2d 296 (1996).

       Because letters of guardianship were issued to the stepmother and had not been revoked or canceled by the circuit court at the time of the insurer's disbursement of the minor daughter's portion of her father's life insurance proceeds to her stepmother as guardian, the insurer was protected by subsection (b) of this section. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of the insurer was proper.

       Hospital challenging a guardianship was not entitled to vacate the original guardianship order because the amended guardianship petition sufficiently addressed the shortcomings of the original petition, and the bank, which had been appointed guardian, relied on the previous guardianship order in prosecuting the underlying medical-negligence claim on the ward's behalf.

       This section violates the due process clause of U.S. Const. Amend. 14 because it fails to provide for a safeguard hearing and meaningful notice of such a hearing. In re Evatt, 291 Ark. 153, 722 S.W.2d 851 (1987) (decision prior to 1987 amendment).

       Since, in emergency situations, advance notice could defeat the purpose of this section because the incapacitated person, when given notice that a hearing was about to be held, might run away, or harm himself or herself or others, or waste his or her property before the hearing could be held, advance notice is not necessary to comply with procedural due process.

   In a guardianship case, the circuit court concluded that it had jurisdiction for the purpose of determining matters of the child's custody, and granted emergency temporary guardianship to the grandparents pursuant to this section; the circuit court reasoned that an emergency existed because (1) the mother's lifestyle created a risk of imminent danger to the child's life or health; and (2) the mother had abandoned care of the child on a number of occasions during her lifetime, and left the child most recently with his grandparents. Thus, pursuant to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.09.html#t09c19s9-19-204" target="_blank">9-19-204</a></cite>, the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that an emergency existed that warranted the circuit court's exercise of jurisdiction over the temporary emergency guardianship petition.
   Devine v. Martens, 371 Ark. 60, 263 S.W.3d 515 (2007), overruled, Fletcher v. Scorza, 2010 Ark. 64, 359 S.W.3d 413 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       In guardianship case, the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that an emergency existed which warranted the grant of temporary emergency guardianship to a child's grandparents based on (1) the mother's lifestyle and the child's health concerns; and (2) the fact that the mother left the child with his grandparents for the last seven and a half months. The circuit court felt it was in the child's best interest to remain with his grandparents until those issues could be further examined.
   Devine v. Martens, 371 Ark. 60, 263 S.W.3d 515 (2007), overruled, Fletcher v. Scorza, 2010 Ark. 64, 359 S.W.3d 413 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the mother had consented to the continuation of a guardianship, she had withdrawn that consent, and since she had not been found to be an unfit parent, the temporary guardianship should have automatically ended.
   Hood v. Hood, 2016 Ark. App. 266, 493 S.W.3d 779 (2016).
      </p>

       Plain reading of subdivision (a)(2) of this section provides that a temporary guardianship may last only up to 90 days, unless it is determined after a hearing that it is necessary to extend it for another period not to exceed 90 days.

       Trial court violated subdivision (a)(2) of this section in continuing a temporary guardianship of two minor children where the guardianship had lasted more than 90 days, and no hearing to determine the propriety of an extension and whether an emergency still existed had been held.

      Acts 1997, No. 331, § 5: Mar. 3, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that in enacting legislation prescribing the various categories of securities and accounts in which guardians may invest funds of wards, credit unions insured by the National Credit Union Administration were inadvertently left out; that failure to include the insured credit unions as authorized depositories of such funds has created and continues to create a serious inequity and an unfair advantage for such credit unions; that this act is designed to eliminate this inequity and should be given effect immediately. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

       (a)(1)
      </b>
      It shall be the duty of the guardian of the person, consistent with and out of the resources of the ward's estate, to care for and maintain the ward and, if he or she is a minor, to see that he or she is protected, properly trained and educated, and that he or she has the opportunity to learn a trade, occupation, or profession.

       Circuit court properly interpreted subdivision (a)(3) of this section to mean that the asserted limitations were placed upon a guardian of a person only, and not the guardian of an estate, where the statute's plain language stated that the guardian of a person did not have the authority to bind the ward or his property.

       Trial court did not clearly err in granting a mother's petition to replace a father as guardian of their 21-year-old son, who had Williams syndrome, because the son needed a guardian who was vigilant in ensuring that his needs were met; there were several occasions where the father delayed or denied the son medical attention.

   Chapter 7 debtors who were guardians of a creditor had a fiduciary responsibility to the creditor created by subdivision (b)(2) of this section and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c73s28-73-303" target="_self">28-73-303</a></cite>, and the debtors committed defalcation as fiduciaries by failing to hold the creditor's estate as directed by a court order and by failing to account for estate funds. Any debt that resulted from the debtors'
   defalcation was therefore nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4).

      <p>
       Contract agreeing to binding arbitration did not violate public policy where the legislature had made clear in enacting this section that a guardian had a duty to invest the estate's funds and the circuit court properly found that the guardian had authority to execute account forms or client agreements necessary to deposit and invest estate funds.

      <p>
       In light of the public policy favoring arbitration and the Legislature's decision to refrain from specifically limiting a guardian's ability to enter into arbitration agreements, a guardian of a patient's person and the patient's estate possessed the authority to enter into an arbitration agreement with a nursing home on behalf of the patient; therefore, the nursing home's motion to compel arbitration should have been granted.

       Circuit court erred as a matter of law when it disallowed expenditures a guardian made during the pendency of a ward's guardianship for the benefit of the guardian because it did not consider whether the expenditures were reasonable, necessary, and proper for the care and maintenance of the ward; the guardian was the ward's spouse, and it was her testimony that the ward was the sole financial provider for almost the entirety of their 40-year marriage.

       A guardian is authorized to employ legal counsel in connection with the discharge of his duties, and the hiring of an attorney is not among those decisions made by a guardian that always requires prior court approval. Johnson v. Guardianship of Ratcliff, 72 Ark. App. 85, 34 S.W.3d 749 (2000).

      <p>
       Subdivision (a)(1)(G) of this section did not apply where the guardian, in signing the investment agreements, did not consent to a settlement or compromise, the claims subject to the arbitration agreement that the guardian had signed had yet to be decided, and thus, no settlement or compromise existed.

       A guardian was held to be the authorized agent appointed by law to take care of and manage his ward's estate; if the estate consisted of land, it was his duty to collect the rents and profits and, to this end, keep the premises in tenantable condition. A guardian could not, without an order of court, make expensive permanent improvements; however, when a guardian made necessary and proper repairs, he should have been allowed credit in his settlement for money so advanced.

      If, at the time of the appointment of a guardian of the estate, the ward owns a business or an interest in a business, the court, by appropriate order, may authorize the guardian to continue the conduct of or participation in such a business in behalf of the ward for such periods of time and subject to such safeguards as the court may find to be for the best interest of the ward.

       In a case involving the management of an estate, a trial court erred by determining that certain expenditures of behalf of a ward were improper; the guardian was allowed to make gifts on behalf of the ward under subsection (b) of this section, he could continue the ward's practice of supporting family members, continuing donations to the ward's church was acceptable, and expenditures for food and clothing fell within the definition of what was required for maintenance. The law of trusts guided the evaluation of the duties and liabilities of the guardian of an estate.

   The circuit court's power to review and conclude, subject to appeal, whether the money is “accessible”, under whatever state or federal regulations may apply, does not mean that the circuit court has the authority to determine how a guardian is to use a ward's funds; that decision lies exclusively within the jurisdiction of the probate court according to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-107ol1a" target="_self">28-65-107(a)</a></cite>. Another provision subdivision (c)(3) of this section, deals with the probate court's authority to invade the principal of a minor ward's estate to provide for support.

The trial court is permitted to take into consideration any failures on the part of the guardian in the allowance of fees. Winters v. Winters, 24 Ark. App. 29, 747 S.W.2d 583 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court abused it's discretion in disallowing all fees and costs incurred during specific dates where the trial court gave no explanation for lowering the attorney's hourly fee, nor did the court explain why it cut off fees incurred prior to a certain date; such decisive but unreasoned action clearly constituted an abuse of discretion. Bailey v. Rahe, 355 Ark. 560, 142 S.W.3d 634 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an estate action, the appellate court was unable to discern whether attorney fees were based on the total market value of the real and personal property reportable to the circuit court or whether they was based on some other measure and certificates of deposit had been inexplicably cashed and placed in a trust and then listed as assets; thus, for purposes of determining attorney fees, which were based in part on the size of the estate, a remand for reconsideration was required to determine which assets were properly estate assets. Monk v. Griffin, 92 Ark. App. 320, 213 S.W.3d 651 (2005).

      A guardianship is terminated:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      If the guardianship was solely because of the ward's incompetency for a cause other than minority, by an adjudication of the competency of the ward;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      By the death of the ward;

     <p>
      <b>
       (3)

      If the guardianship was solely because of the ward's minority, the marriage of the ward shall terminate a guardianship of the person, but not of the estate of the ward except with respect to the ward's earnings for personal services; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      If the guardianship was solely because of the ward's minority, by the ward's reaching the age of majority, unless the guardian receives a guardianship subsidy from the Department of Human Services, then the guardianship is terminated when the ward:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      Reaches twenty-one (21) years of age; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      Who is eighteen (18) years of age or older requests termination of the guardianship.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      A guardianship may be terminated by court order after such notice as the court may require:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)(A)
      </b>
      If the guardianship was solely because of the ward's minority, and either the ward attains his or her majority or the disability of minority of the ward is removed for all purposes by a court of competent jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      However, if the court finds upon a proper showing by substantial competent evidence that it is in the best interest of the ward that the guardianship be continued after the ward reaches majority, the court may order the guardianship to continue until such time as it may be terminated by order of the court;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      If the ward becomes a nonresident of this state; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If, for any other reason, the guardianship is:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      No longer necessary; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>

      </b>
      No longer in the best interest of the ward.

       (c)(1)
      </b>
      When a guardianship terminates otherwise than by the death of the ward, the powers of the guardian cease, except that a guardian of the estate may make disbursements for claims that are or may be allowed by the court, for liabilities already properly incurred for the estate or for the ward, and for expenses of administration.
     </p>

       Subdivision (b)(3) of this section plainly states that the method to terminate a guardianship is disjunctive: a guardianship may be terminated by court order if the guardianship is no longer necessary or for the best interest of the ward.

       Where a guardian in succession had been appointed as a result of the improper use of ward's funds by original guardian and natural mother, and ward, then 22, ratified such use of funds, which the guardian in succession was attempting to recover from the mother and her bonding company, it was not in the best interests of the ward to continue the guardianship and it was ordered terminated subject to the payment by the mother and the bonding company of any other claim against them and the costs of the guardianship. Continental Ins. Co. v. Estate of Rowan, 252 Ark. 980, 482 S.W.2d 102 (1972) (decision under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior holding that this section allows the court to consider the best interest of the ward in deciding whether to terminate a guardianship and that the rights of the natural parents are not proprietary, would not be interpreted as providing the only guidelines a probate court can consider in terminating a guardianship. Hooks v. Pratte, 53 Ark. App. 161, 920 S.W.2d 24 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in applying a child custody change in circumstances analysis in deciding a mother's petition to terminate the guardianship of her child by his paternal grandmother because the appropriate standard to be applied in guardianship termination proceedings was the statutory standard set out in subdivision (b)(3) of this section.
   Graham v. Matheny, 2009 Ark. 481, 346 S.W.3d 273 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the mother's petition to terminate guardianship was improper because this section was not applied to her in the least restrictive available method where there was no weight given to her decision to terminate despite the presumption that she acted in her child's best interest. Therefore, the application of this section violated the mother's constitutional right.
   Troeskyn v. Herrington (In re S.H.), 2012 Ark. 245, 409 S.W.3d 307 (2012), overruled in part, Lineham v. Hyde (In re W.L.), 2015 Ark. 289, 467 S.W.3d 129 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court's finding that it remained in the children's best interest to leave the guardianship with the paternal grandparents intact was clearly erroneous where the mother had stable employment, a suitable home, family support, and a close relationship with the children, and overnight visitation had been consistently exercised with no issues other than minor disciplinary disagreements with the paternal grandparents; thus, the fit-parent presumption that the mother had acted in her children's best interest was not rebutted.

   The fact that an Arkansas guardianship may be terminated if the ward becomes a nonresident of the state constitutes express legislative recognition that guardians may effect a change in residence.

       Where a mother erroneously concluded that a minor's marriage emancipated him and that his signed receipt cleared her of liability as his guardian with respect to the father's estate, although the minor was not bound by the signed receipt, and the guardian, before expending the corpus, failed to obtain prior authorization and to file regular reports of expenditures, as required by law, the probate court could properly apply such charges against the minor's claim against his mother-guardian's estate.

      <p>
       Evidence justified a finding that the natural parents voluntarily consented to an order appointing an aunt as the guardian for their daughter and that they asked her to raise the child, and while they did not thereby forfeit their parental rights, the burden was upon them to show that a termination of the guardianship would be in the child's best interest. In re Guardianship of Markham, 32 Ark. App. 46, 795 S.W.2d 931 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother presented sufficient evidence to show that guardianship was no longer necessary and that it would be in child's best interests to terminate the guardianship and reunite him with his mother; she had entered drug treatment program and remained drug-free since leaving that program, she was happily married, and she voluntarily had been sending guardian support money. Hooks v. Pratte, 53 Ark. App. 161, 920 S.W.2d 24 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fit parent who consented to a guardianship puts forth sufficient evidence to terminate the guardianship, and meets the burden going forward, by revoking consent and informing the court that the conditions necessitating the guardianship no longer exist; the guardians must rebut the presumption, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination of the guardianship is in the child's best interest, and the court must always consider the parent's right to parent his or her child in that decision.
   Troesken v. Herrington (In re S.H.), 2015 Ark. 75, 455 S.W.3d 313 (2015), overruled in part, Lineham v. Hyde (In re W.L.), 2015 Ark. 289, 467 S.W.3d 129 (2015).

       The rights of parents are not proprietary and are subject to their related duty to care for and protect the child, and the law secures their preferential rights only so long as they discharge their obligations. In re Guardianship of Markham, 32 Ark. App. 46, 795 S.W.2d 931 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fit parent is presumed to act in the child's best interest when consenting to the guardianship and, later, when terminating the guardianship; fit, natural parents who consent to a guardianship need additional protection in seeking to terminate the guardianship.
   Troesken v. Herrington (In re S.H.), 2015 Ark. 75, 455 S.W.3d 313 (2015), overruled in part, Lineham v. Hyde (In re W.L.), 2015 Ark. 289, 467 S.W.3d 129 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court erred in applying the two methods set forth in subdivision (b)(3) of this section in a conjunctive manner where the statute plainly stated that the methods were disjunctive. After the termination of the temporary guardianship, when the mother revoked her consent to the guardianship, she was entitled to the fit-parent presumption and the burden shifted to the opposing party to demonstrate that the guardianship was still necessary or in the child's best interest.

       In a guardianship termination proceeding, probate court did not err in dismissing alleged natural father as a party where there had never been any adjudication of paternity and where alleged natural father, contending that under Texas law a man was considered the father if his name appeared on the child's birth certificate, never filed a birth certificate stating that he was the father with the Texas court.

       Under subdivision (b)(3) of this section, the mother was entitled to the fit-parent presumption that the guardianship of her children with the paternal grandparents was no longer necessary. It was clear from the record that the reasons for the guardianship, i.e., exposure to the former husband's family members and one child's feeling safer at the paternal grandparents'
   home, no longer existed at the time of the termination hearing, and the circuit court clearly erred in finding that the reason for originally granting the guardianship still existed (mother's former husband was serving sentence for rape of one of the children).

       Circuit court did not err when it failed to terminate the guardianship of a child by the child's paternal aunt and uncle and to establish the child's maternal grandparent as the guardian of the child because the court considered the testimony of the status of the child's circumstances and made a determination regarding the child's best interest.

       Trial court did not clearly err in denying an individual's petition to terminate a guardianship where he failed to provide persuasive compelling evidence that he was no longer incapacitated or that a guardianship was no longer necessary to protect his best interests, and the trial court was obviously persuaded by a psychologist's professional opinion that the individual was not yet ready to be without the protection afforded by the guardianship.

       Father's petition to terminate guardianship was properly denied where he had been found unfit as a parent in the guardianship proceedings, he remained unfit going into the hearing on his petition to terminate the guardianship, and he had invited the error as to whether he was required to prove that guardianship was no longer necessary and in the child's best interests given his attorney's concession at the outset of the petition hearing that the father had the burden to establish that he was a fit parent.

       Where an incompetent brought a guardianship termination proceeding, in which she requested the trial court to adjudicate and restore her competency, and the evidence clearly established that the plaintiff was competent to care for herself and her home and had done so for the previous 12 years, the trial court erred in refusing to grant her request because there was no evidence that she suffered from the requisite mental incapacity of unsoundness of mind required to necessitate the appointment of a guardian, notwithstanding the fact that she was unable to properly manage her finances due to her inexperience in such matters.

       Child's natural parent who had consented to the guardianship of the child so that she could join the military and who was never found to be unfit as a parent was entitled to have the guardianship terminated because she put forth evidence that the guardianship was no longer necessary, as she had been discharged from the military, and the guardian failed to rebut the presumption that termination was in the child's best interest. The trial court's determination that the guardian did not rebut the presumption that the parent was acting in the child's best interest was not clearly erroneous, particularly because, where the case involved a child, the trial court's evaluation of the witnesses, their testimony, and the best interest of the child was entitled to a high degree of deference.

       Father, who had a full-time job, was in a three-year committed relationship with his wife, had visited Arkansas 18 times to see the child and communicated with her through phone calls multiple times per week, and had the child for two six-week summer vacations, was a fit parent; thus, the trial court should have terminated the guardianship once the father revoked his consent.

       Circuit court erred in denying a a mother's petition to terminate a guardianship because it applied a legal standard that failed to safeguard the mother's fundamental right with respect to the care, custody, and control of her child; when the mother withdrew her consent in her petition to terminate the guardianship and testified that the conditions necessitating the guardianship no longer existed, she met her burden going forward that the guardianship was no longer necessary.

      <p>
       Circuit court erred in denying a a mother's petition to terminate a guardianship because the father's parents failed to rebut the presumption, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination of the guardianship was in the child's best interest; the mother remained a fit parent, which was all that mattered for constitutional purposes, and no evidence was shown that the mother could not also provide the love and affection that the father's parents did.
   Troesken v. Herrington (In re S.H.), 2015 Ark. 75, 455 S.W.3d 313 (2015), overruled in part, Lineham v. Hyde (In re W.L.), 2015 Ark. 289, 467 S.W.3d 129 (2015).

      <p>
       Natural parent who has not been declared unfit is presumed to act in his or her own child's best interest, and this presumption is applicable when such a parent seeks to terminate an existing guardianship over his or her minor child, in which case a parent's petition to terminate the guardianship need only inform the court that the guardianship is no longer necessary, which is an otherwise fit parent's only burden of proof; once that lack of necessity is communicated to a trial court by a fit parent, the court ordinarily terminates the guardianship, and the guardianship should only remain in place due to some circumstance that could overcome the parent's fundamental right to raise his or her child (decided under former version of subdivision (b)(3) before the 2017 amendment).
   Morris v. Clark, 2019 Ark. 130, 572 S.W.3d 366 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's determination that it is in a minor ward's best interests for a guardianship to remain in place, standing alone, is insufficient to defeat a fit parent's substantive due process interest in raising his or her own child because there is a constitutional presumption that a fit parent acts in his or her child's best interests, so where the parent has not previously been found unfit, weighing best interests at the outset of an inquiry into terminating a guardianship is inappropriate, and the mere fact that a child may have more or better opportunities with another family cannot be enough to keep that child away from an otherwise fit parent (decided under former version of subdivision (b)(3) before the 2017 amendment).
   Morris v. Clark, 2019 Ark. 130, 572 S.W.3d 366 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a parent who has not previously been determined to be unfit petitions for termination of an existing guardianship over his or her minor child, trial courts ordinarily should only decline to terminate the guardianship where the guardian contests the parent's fitness and establishes that the parent is presently unfit, and where an otherwise fit natural parent seeks to terminate an existing guardianship and the parent is not found to be presently unfit, a trial court should dispose of the guardianship routinely (decided under former version of subdivision (b)(3) before the 2017 amendment).
   Morris v. Clark, 2019 Ark. 130, 572 S.W.3d 366 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to deny a parent's petition to terminate a guardianship of the parent's child to which the parent had consented because the parent was not found to be unfit, so the parent's preference for what should happen to the child was entitled to special weight (decided under former version of subdivision (b)(3) before the 2017 amendment).

     The mere fact that a man had been adjudged incompetent under the Uniform Veterans' Guardian Act and a guardian was appointed for his estate did not affect his capacity to marry or sue for divorce where he had never needed a personal guardian and the incompetency had been established 11 years before the marriage and almost 20 years prior to the divorce action. Lovett v. Lovett, 254 Ark. 349, 493 S.W.2d 435 (1973).

      A petition for the appointment of a guardian may be filed by any relative or friend of the ward or by any person who is authorized by law to file such a petition. If there is no person so authorized or if the person so authorized refuses or fails to file such a petition within thirty (30) days after the mailing of notice by the Veterans' Administration to the last known address of the person, if any, indicating the necessity for the same, a petition for appointment may be filed by any resident of this state.

     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The petition for appointment shall set forth the name, age, place of residence of the ward, the name and place of residence of the nearest relative, if known, and the fact that the ward is entitled to receive benefits payable by or through the Veterans' Administration and shall set forth the amount of moneys then due and the amount of probable future payments.

     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      The petition shall also set forth the name and address of the person or institution, if any, having actual custody of the ward and the name, age, relationship, if any, occupation, and address of the proposed guardian, and, if the nominee is a natural person, the number of wards for whom the nominee is presently acting as guardian.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any law as to priority of persons entitled to appointment, or the nomination in the petition, the court may appoint some other individual or a bank or trust company as guardian, if the court determines it is for the best interest of the ward.
     </p>
     <p>

       A probate court had the power to authorize the guardian of a mentally incompetent veteran to purchase a home for the ward and his dependent family and pay for the home out of the proceeds of the ward's estate. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Chambers, 204 Ark. 81, 160 S.W.2d 888 (1942) (decision under prior law).

      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The court may authorize the purchase of the entire fee simple title to real estate in this state in which the guardian has no interest, but only as a home for the ward, or to protect his interest, or (if he is not a minor) as a home for his dependent family. Such purchase of real estate shall not be made except upon the entry of an order of the court after hearing upon verified petition. A copy of the petition shall be furnished the proper office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and notice of hearing thereon shall be given said office as provided in the case of hearing on a guardian's account. As used in this subdivision (1), “no interest” means that a guardian should not even have a mortgage lien interest in the real estate purchased as a home for the ward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Before authorizing such investment, the court shall require written evidence of value and of title and of the advisability of acquiring such real estate. Title shall be taken in the ward's name. This section does not limit the right of the guardian on behalf of his ward to bid and to become the purchaser of real estate at a sale thereof pursuant to decree of foreclosure of lien held by or for the ward, or at a trustee's sale, to protect the ward's right in the property so foreclosed or sold; nor does it limit the right of the guardian, if such be necessary to protect the ward's interest and upon prior order of the court in which the guardianship is pending, to agree with cotenants of the ward for a partition in kind, or to purchase from cotenants the entire undivided interest held by them, or to bid and purchase the same at a sale under a partition decree, or to compromise adverse claims of title to the ward's realty.

      Whenever, in any proceeding under the laws of this state for the commitment of a person alleged to be of unsound mind or otherwise in need of confinement in a hospital or other institution for his proper care, it is determined after such adjudication of the status of such person as may be required by law that commitment to a hospital for mental disease or other institution is necessary for safekeeping or treatment and it appears that such person is eligible for care or treatment by the Veterans' Administration or other agency of the United States Government, the court, upon receipt of a certificate from the Veterans' Administration or such other agency showing that facilities are available and that such person is eligible for care or treatment therein, may commit such person to said Veterans' Administration or other agency. The person whose commitment is sought shall be personally served with notice of the pending commitment proceeding in the manner as provided by the law of this state; and nothing in this chapter shall affect his right to appear and be heard in the proceedings. Upon commitment, such person when admitted to any facility operated by any such agency within or without this state shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the Veterans' Administration or other agency. The chief officer of any facility of the Veterans' Administration or institution operated by any other agency of the United States to which the person is so committed shall with respect to such person be vested with the same powers as superintendents of state hospitals for mental diseases within this state with respect to retention of custody, transfer, parole, or discharge. Jurisdiction is retained in the committing or other appropriate court of this state at any time to inquire into the mental condition of the person so committed and to determine the necessity for continuance of his restraint, and all commitments pursuant to this chapter are so conditioned.

      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The judgment or order of commitment by a court of competent jurisdiction of another state or of the District of Columbia, committing a person to the Veterans' Administration, or other agency of the United States Government for care or treatment shall have the same force and effect as to the committed person while in this state as in the jurisdiction in which is situated the court entering the judgment or making the order; and the courts of the committing state, or of the District of Columbia, shall be deemed to have retained jurisdiction of the person so committed for the purpose of inquiring into the mental condition of such person, and of determining the necessity for continuance of his restraint, as is provided in subsection (1) of this section with respect to persons committed by the courts of this state. Consent is hereby given to the application of the law of the committing state or district in respect to the authority of the chief officer of any facility of the Veterans' Administration, or of any institution operated in this state by any other agency of the United States to retain custody, or transfer, parole, or discharge the committed person.

      Upon receipt of a certificate of the Veterans' Administration or such other agency of the United States that facilities are available for the care or treatment of any person heretofore committed to any hospital for the insane or other institution for the care or treatment of persons similarly afflicted and that such person is eligible for care or treatment, the superintendent of the institution may cause the transfer of such person to the Veterans' Administration or other agency of the United States for care or treatment. Upon effecting any such transfer, the committing court or proper officer thereof shall be notified thereof by the transferring agency. No person shall be transferred to the Veterans' Administration or other agency of the United States if he be confined pursuant to conviction of any felony or misdemeanor or if he has been acquitted of the charge solely on the ground of insanity, unless prior to transfer the court or other authority originally committing such person shall enter an order for such transfer after appropriate motion and hearing.

       Lawyers were entitled to summary judgment with respect to claims filed by heirs alleging that the lawyers intentionally interfered with the heirs'
   inheritance because there was no evidence that the only lawyer who was involved with the will had acted by fraud, duress, or other tortious means to intentionally prevent the heirs from receiving an inheritance. To the extent that a conservator had been appointed under this section to manage the decedent's financial affairs prior to the time she executed her will, that appointment did not, as a matter of law, mean that the decedent was incompetent to execute a will.

       Ademption of a devise did not take place as to unexpended, identifiable proceeds of a timber sale because the timber was sold by an attorney-in-fact at a time when the testatrix was incompetent, and the testatrix did not regain testamentary capacity before her death; the statute did not preclude such a holding because while the estate was unquestionably bound by the sale of the timber, the statute was silent on the issue of who was entitled to the proceeds of the sale.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A document substantially in the following form may be used to create a statutory form power of attorney that has the meaning and effect prescribed by this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARKANSAS STATUTORY FORM POWER OF ATTORNEY
     </p>
     <p>
      IMPORTANT INFORMATION
     </p>
     <p>
      This power of attorney authorizes another person (your agent) to make decisions concerning your property for you (the principal). Your agent will be able to make decisions and act with respect to your property (including your money) whether or not you are able to act for yourself. The meaning of authority over subjects listed on this form is explained in the Uniform Power of Attorney Act, Arkansas Code Title 28, Chapter 68.
     </p>
     <p>
      This power of attorney does not authorize the agent to make health-care decisions for you.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should select someone you trust to serve as your agent. Unless you specify otherwise, generally the agent's authority will continue until you die or revoke the power of attorney or the agent resigns or is unable to act for you.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your agent is entitled to reasonable compensation unless you state otherwise in the Special Instructions.
     </p>
     <p>
      This form provides for designation of one agent. If you wish to name more than one agent you may name a coagent in the Special Instructions. Coagents are not required to act together unless you include that requirement in the Special Instructions.
     </p>
     <p>
      If your agent is unable or unwilling to act for you, your power of attorney will end unless you have named a successor agent. You may also name a second successor agent.
     </p>
     <p>
      This power of attorney becomes effective immediately unless you state otherwise in the Special Instructions.
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      act in good faith;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      disclose your identity as an agent whenever you act for the principal by writing or printing the name of the principal and signing your own name as “agent” in the following manner:

     <p>
      (Principal's Name) by (Your Signature) as Agent
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless the Special Instructions in this power of attorney state otherwise, you must also:

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      attempt to preserve the principal's estate plan if you know the plan and preserving the plan is consistent with the principal's best interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Termination of Agent's Authority
     </p>
     <p>
      You must stop acting on behalf of the principal if you learn of any event that terminates this power of attorney or your authority under this power of attorney. Events that terminate a power of attorney or your authority to act under a power of attorney include:
     </p>

    A.C.R.C. Notes.
   
   Although Acts 2011, No. 805, § 1, stated that “Arkansas Code Title 28, Chapter 68, is amended to read as follows:”, indicating that the entire chapter was being amended, one of the sections in that chapter, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c68s28-68-303" target="_self">28-68-303</a></cite>, was omitted from the act. Because the subject matter of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c68s28-68-303" target="_self">28-68-303</a></cite> would not be compatible with Chapter 68 as amended by Acts 2011, No. 805, the omission of § 28-68-303 from the act indicates a repeal of that section.

      If a fiduciary or the nominee of a fiduciary in whose name are registered, or are to be registered, any shares of stocks, bonds, or other securities of any public or private corporation, company, other association, or of any trust, applies for the registration or transfer of the shares, then the corporation, company, other association, or any of the managers of the trust or its or their transfer agent, is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary or nominee is committing a breach of his or her obligation as fiduciary or nominee in making the registration or transfer nor to see to the performance of the fiduciary obligation. The corporation, company, other association, or any of the managers of the trust, or its or their transfer agent, are liable for the registration or transfer only where the registration or transfer is made with actual knowledge that the fiduciary or nominee is committing a breach of trust in requesting the registration or transfer or with knowledge of the facts that its or their participation in the registration or transfer amounts to bad faith.

       Trial court considered case law from other jurisdictions that permitted the modification the trustee requested in this case, in order to qualify a beneficiary for public benefits, but the trial court did not find that the modification was permissible under public policy and Arkansas law; the court was not left with a firm conviction that a mistake was committed.

       Trustee intended to modify the trust in order to qualify a beneficiary for public benefits; because impoverishing the beneficiary in order to qualify her would make the trust provisions void, the modified provisions would have been void on grounds of public policy, and the trial court's denial of the modification motion was that the purpose for modifying the trust would be defeated.

      After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (1)
   
   A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the rules in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-301" target="_self">28-70-301</a></cite> et seq., §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-401" target="_self">28-70-401</a></cite> et seq., and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-501" target="_self">28-70-501</a></cite> et seq. which apply to trustees and the rules in paragraph (5). The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (2)
   
   A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest under the rules in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-301" target="_self">28-70-301</a></cite> et seq., §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-401" target="_self">28-70-401</a></cite> et seq., and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-501" target="_self">28-70-501</a></cite> et seq. which apply to trustees and by:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)

      including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants, and fiduciaries; court costs and other expenses of administration; and interest on death taxes, but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent's estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances, and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under paragraph (2) or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (4)
   
   A fiduciary shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by paragraph (3) in the manner described in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-202" target="_self">28-70-202</a></cite> to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (5)
   
   A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in paragraph (1) because of a payment described in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-501" target="_self">28-70-501</a></cite> or §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-502" target="_self">28-70-502</a></cite> to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

    (a)
   
   Each beneficiary described in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-201ol14" target="_self">28-70-201(4)</a></cite> is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one who does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      In determining a beneficiary's share of net income, the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold to meet principal obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      The distribution date for purposes of this section may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which assets are actually distributed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      If a fiduciary does not distribute all of the collected but undistributed net income to each person as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain appropriate records showing the interest of each beneficiary in that net income.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      A trustee may apply the rules in this section, to the extent that the trustee considers it appropriate, to net gain or loss realized after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date from the disposition of a principal asset if this section applies to the income from the asset.

      A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date. An income receipt or disbursement must be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it has no due date. The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins must be allocated to principal, and the balance must be allocated to income.

   An item of income or an obligation is due on the date the payer is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the purposes of this chapter. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c70s28-70-401" target="_self">28-70-401</a></cite> applies are deemed to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that must be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.

      In this section, “undistributed income” means net income received before the date on which an income interest ends.

In the latter case, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked must be added to principal.

      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      If a trustee who conducts a business or other activity determines that it is in the best interest of all the beneficiaries to account separately for the business or activity instead of accounting for it as part of the trust's general accounting records, the trustee may maintain separate accounting records for its transactions, whether or not its assets are segregated from other trust assets.

      <b>
       (b)

      A trustee who accounts separately for a business or other activity may determine the extent to which its net cash receipts must be retained for working capital, the acquisition or replacement of fixed assets, and other reasonably foreseeable needs of the business or activity, and the extent to which the remaining net cash receipts are accounted for as principal or income in the trust's general accounting records. If a trustee sells assets of the business or other activity, other than in the ordinary course of the business or activity, the trustee shall account for the net amount received as principal in the trust's general accounting records to the extent the trustee determines that the amount received is no longer required in the conduct of the business.

     <p>
      <b>

Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse.

      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      A fiduciary may make adjustments between principal and income to offset the shifting of economic interests or tax benefits between income beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries which arise from:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      elections and decisions, other than those described in subsection (b), that the fiduciary makes from time to time regarding tax matters;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      an income tax or any other tax that is imposed upon the fiduciary or a beneficiary as a result of a transaction involving or a distribution from the estate or trust; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      the ownership by an estate or trust of an interest in an entity whose taxable income, whether or not distributed, is includable in the taxable income of the estate, trust, or a beneficiary.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      If the amount of an estate tax marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes, and as a result estate taxes paid from principal are increased and income taxes paid by an estate, trust, or beneficiary are decreased, each estate, trust, or beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax shall reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid. The total reimbursement must equal the increase in the estate tax to the extent that the principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction but for the payment. The proportionate share of the reimbursement for each estate, trust, or beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced must be the same as its proportionate share of the total decrease in income tax. An estate or trust shall reimburse principal from income.

   Within the limitations of the standard set forth in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c71s28-71-105" target="_self">28-71-105</a></cite>, a fiduciary is authorized to acquire and retain every kind of real, personal, or mixed property and every kind of investment, specifically including, but not by way of limitation, bonds, debentures, and other corporate obligations, preferred or common stocks, shares or interests in common trust funds, and securities of any open-end or closed-end management-type investment company or investment trust registered under the Federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence acquire or retain for their own account.

      Whenever a fiduciary is authorized or required by the instrument, judgment, decree, or order establishing the fiduciary relationship to invest funds in specifically described securities, the fiduciary may, unless expressly prohibited by such an instrument, judgment, decree, or order, invest such funds in any investment company or investment trust described in subsection (a) of this section, the portfolio of which is limited to such specifically described securities and to repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such specifically described securities, provided that the investment company or investment trust takes delivery of the collateral either directly or through an authorized custodian.
     </p>

      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, this subsection shall apply to all funds deposited with or controlled by any bank trustee acting in a fiduciary capacity in connection with the issuance, sale or redemption of bonds, notes, and other certificates of indebtedness.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      Unless expressly prohibited by the instrument, judgment, decree, or order establishing the fiduciary relationship, a fiduciary may invest funds in certificates of deposit and savings accounts of any state bank or national bank whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and whose main office is in this state, including itself, if the fiduciary is a bank.

      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      Unless prohibited by federal law or regulations promulgated thereunder, but notwithstanding any law or rule of this state to the contrary, fiduciaries and financial institutions may invest up to no more than two and one-half percent (2½%) of their funds eligible for investment, but not more than ten percent (10%) of their capital, including common capital stock, certified surplus, capital notes, and undivided profits, in Arkansas private venture capital projects without being in contravention of any prudent investor rule. This limitation is applicable only at the time of investment, and it shall not constitute a contravention of the prudent investor rule if investments in Arkansas private venture capital projects are in excess of this limitation by virtue of a reduction in the amount of funds eligible for investment.

     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      The primary state regulators of the fiduciaries making such investments under this section shall promulgate rules for the implementation of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)(1)
      </b>
      The prudent investor rule is embodied in several laws of this state pertaining to the investment of funds by financial institutions and fiduciaries, and the General Assembly has determined that the people of this state would benefit by the limited relaxation of the prudent investor rule to the extent that fiduciaries and financial institutions should be allowed to invest a small portion of their assets in private venture capital projects within this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      It is the intent of this section to allow fiduciaries and financial institutions to invest up to two and one-half percent (2½%) of their funds eligible for investment, but not more than ten percent (10%) of their capital, including common capital stock, certified surplus, capital notes, and undivided profits, in Arkansas private venture capital projects without incurring liability for violation of the prudent investor rule.

   The Supreme Court declined to adopt a proposal granting a probate judge jurisdiction to appoint a trustee for a lawyer who is disabled, deceased, or has disappeared, since this proposal would clearly conflict with the statutory scheme for establishing a guardianship for an incompetent attorney as well as the statutory scheme for decedent's estates, under chapter 65 of this title, and since there are express statutes, under this section and §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c72s28-72-103" target="_self">28-72-103</a></cite> and<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c72s28-72-104" target="_self">28-72-104</a></cite>, which conflict with the proposal for attorneys who have disappeared.

   descendants were entitled to the beneficiaries'
   shares of the trust distribution under subdivision (a)(3)(iv) of this section, which provides for a deceased beneficiary's interest in a custodial trust to pass to the beneficiary's estate, did not apply to an inter vivos trusts.

      It is found and declared by the General Assembly that the establishment of a long-term intergenerational security trust with tax deferment provisions for an individual under eighteen (18) years of age will enable the individual's family and friends to take advantage of long-term growth opportunities and provide for the accumulation of a sizable sum of money for the individual's retirement and financial security.

   Trustee's appeal of the circuit court's order that he had breached his fiduciary duty and that two trust assets had to be reappraised and the assets of the trust redistributed accordingly was properly dismissed without prejudice due to lack of finality. Although §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-116" target="_self">28-1-116</a></cite> governed probate matters, which Ark. R. App. P. Civ. 2(a)(12) dictated were immediately appealable, trust matters were governed by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c73s28-73-101" target="_self">28-73-101</a></cite> et seq., and those statutes were not designated by Ark. R. App. P. Civ. 2(a)(12); in addition, no parties had been dismissed, the action had not been discharged, and the rights to the subject matter had not been concluded as the value of the two parcels of land was still unknown, and the value of each beneficiaries'
   share was unknown.

   Chapter 7 debtors who were guardians of a creditor had a fiduciary responsibility to the creditor created by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c65s28-65-301ol1b2" target="_self">28-65-301(b)(2)</a></cite> and this section, and the debtors committed defalcation as fiduciaries by failing to hold the creditor's estate as directed by a court order and by failing to account for estate funds. Any debt that resulted from the debtors'
   defalcation was therefore nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4).

       While the regional medical center was not the same entity as the hospital that the decedent left the remainder of his property to if the named beneficiaries predeceased him, the regional medical center was the appropriate cy pres beneficiary because the entity that operated the hospital was the intended object of the decedent's bequest and the decedent had the charitable intent to promote public health when he made the devise to the hospital. Thus, the circuit court did not err in deciding that the decedent's estate should be used to further the patient-care and community programs that a new clinic would provide the community, and it fashioned a use for the funds as near to the decedent's intent as possible under the circumstances.

       Circuit court erred in applying the cy pres doctrine to reform a testamentary trust because the testator created the trust for the administration of four life estates with the remainder to two churches, which vested on the testator's death, there was no provision that the devise was to serve a charitable purpose or that restricted the churches from using the proceeds for noncharitable purposes, and neither the trustee nor the churches was directed to ensure that the use of the property be for a purpose benefiting any charity.

       While the regional medical center was not the same entity as the hospital that the decedent left the remainder of his property to if the named beneficiaries predeceased him, the regional medical center was the appropriate cy pres beneficiary because the entity that operated the hospital was the intended object of the decedent's bequest and the decedent had the charitable intent to promote public health when he made the devise to the hospital. Thus, the circuit court did not err in deciding that the decedent's estate should be used to further the patient-care and community programs that a new clinic would provide the community, and it fashioned a use for the funds as near to the decedent's intent as possible under the circumstances.

       Circuit court erred in applying the cy pres doctrine to reform a testamentary trust because the testator created the trust for the administration of four life estates with the remainder to two churches, which vested on the testator's death, there was no provision that the devise was to serve a charitable purpose or that restricted the churches from using the proceeds for noncharitable purposes, and neither the trustee nor the churches was directed to ensure that the use of the property be for a purpose benefiting any charity.

       In a trust reformation action, as a settlor's hearsay statements regarding who should or would benefit from the trust had no bearing on whether the estate itself would benefit from the trust corpus, they were not against the interest of the declarant's estate and thus were not admissible under Ark. R. Evid. 804(b)(3) as statements against interest.

       Although debtor, acting as executrix, retained control over the assets in the testator's estate, and she may have improperly exercised that control in her capacity as executrix, her conduct in that capacity did not invalidate the spendthrift provision; because the spendthrift provision was enforceable under subsection (a) of this section, debtor's interest in the net income from the trust was subject to a restriction on transfer under applicable nonbankruptcy law, the 11 U.S.C.S. § 541(c)(2) exception applied, and debtor's interest in the distributions of net income from the trust was not a part of her bankruptcy estate.

      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      Whether or not a trust contains a spendthrift provision, a creditor of a beneficiary may not compel a distribution that is subject to the trustee's discretion, even if:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      the discretion is expressed in the form of a standard of distribution; or

       (2)
      </b>
      the trustee has abused the discretion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    (b)
   
   This section does not limit the right of a beneficiary to maintain a judicial proceeding against a trustee for an abuse of discretion or failure to comply with a standard for distribution. Under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c73s28-73-814ol1a" target="_self">28-73-814(a)</a></cite>, a trustee must always exercise a discretionary power in good faith and with regard to the purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      A creditor may not reach the interest of a beneficiary who is also a trustee or cotrustee, or otherwise compel a distribution, if the trustee's discretion to make distributions for the trustee's own benefit is limited by an ascertainable standard.

      <b>
       (1)

If a trust has more than one (1) settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      With respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor's benefit. If a trust has more than one (1) settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.

       (1)
      </b>
      During the period the power may be exercised, the holder of a power of withdrawal is treated in the same manner as the settlor of a revocable trust to the extent of the property subject to the power.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      On the lapse, release, or waiver of a power of withdrawal, the holder of a power of withdrawal is not, by reason of any such power of withdrawal, treated as the settlor of the trust.

       Although property subject to spendthrift provision would not become property of bankruptcy estate, duty of trustee upon beneficiary's death was to make distribution of specific bequests to debtor and not hold them in trust. Thus, under Arkansas law, spendthrift provision did not apply to specific bequests and did not prevent them from coming into bankruptcy estate.

       (a)
      </b>
      To the extent a trust is revocable by a settlor, a trustee may follow a direction of the settlor that is contrary to the terms of the trust. To the extent a trust is revocable by a settlor in conjunction with a person other than a trustee or person holding an adverse interest, the trustee may follow a direction from the settlor and the other person holding the power to revoke even if the direction is contrary to the terms of the trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      While a trust is revocable and the settlor has capacity to revoke the trust, rights of the beneficiaries are subject to the control of, and the duties of the trustee are owed exclusively to, the settlor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      During the period the power may be exercised, the holder of a power of withdrawal has the rights of a settlor of a revocable trust under this section to the extent of the property subject to the power.

     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      A person may commence a judicial proceeding to contest the validity of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death within the earlier of:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      three (3) years after the settlor's death; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      ninety (90) days after the trustee sent the person a notice informing the person of the trust's existence, the settlor's name, the trustee's name and address, the time allowed for commencing a proceeding, and a description of the beneficiary's interest, if any.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Upon the death of the settlor of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death, the trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust. The trustee is not subject to liability for the distribution unless:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      the trustee knows of a pending judicial proceeding contesting the validity of the trust; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      a potential contestant has notified the trustee of a possible judicial proceeding to contest the trust and a judicial proceeding is commenced within sixty (60) days after the contestant sent the notification.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      A beneficiary of a trust that is determined to have been invalid is liable to return any distribution received.

       In a dispute over whether a bank properly declined a trusteeship, the circuit court's order directing the bank to perform an accounting was proper because the bank's actions exceeded the mere preservation of trust property and were instead consistent with exercising powers as trustee; therefore, reliance on the safe harbor provision in this section was unavailing.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)

      there has been a substantial change of circumstances or removal is requested by all of the qualified beneficiaries, the court finds that removal of the trustee best serves the interests of all of the beneficiaries and is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust, and a suitable cotrustee or successor trustee is available.

    (c)
   
   Pending a final decision on a request to remove a trustee, or in lieu of or in addition to removing a trustee, the court may order such appropriate relief under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c73s28-73-1001ol1b" target="_self">28-73-1001(b)</a></cite> as may be necessary to protect the trust property or the interests of the beneficiaries.

      </h4>
      <p>
       In litigation brought by a secondary beneficiary over the administration of several family trusts, the circuit court erred by denying plaintiff a jury trial on his legal claims (breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, fraud and concealment, and conspiracy); the clean-up doctrine has been abolished in Arkansas. Plaintiff was not entitled to a jury trial on his equitable claims (removal of trustee and injunctive relief).

       Under this section, only the court, a settlor, cotrustee, or a beneficiary could initiate an action to remove a trustee; an attorney who was named in the trust as the one to select a new trustee in the event the trust administration was moved from Little Rock had no standing to remove the existing trustee.

   Beneficiary's claims that the trustee converted trust assets, deposited proceeds into her personal accounts, and actively concealed and failed to disclose her dealings with trust assets and investment of proceeds were assertions of breach of trust; therefore, the statute of limitations in the Arkansas Trust Code in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c73s28-73-1005" target="_self">28-73-1005</a></cite> controlled, rather than the more general three-year tort limitations period in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-105" target="_blank">16-56-105</a></cite>.

       Appellant beneficiary, who argued that appellees owed a duty of loyalty to her in their administration of a trust, presented issues of material fact to be tried concerning a conflict between a co-trustee's fiduciary and personal interests and how it may have affected his vote preventing appellant from purchasing a 1.5-acre tract adjoining his land. Therefore, summary judgment in this case was inappropriate.

       Trust beneficiaries contended that they were entitled to the detailed billing records of a law firm that represented the bank during its time as trustee. The appellate court ruled that since the beneficiaries were reasonably informed as to what the bank was paying, the appellate court could not say that the circuit court clearly erred in denying the beneficiaries access to the detailed billing invoices.

   Material question of fact existed concerning the adequacy of a trustee's reports because the beneficiary argued the reports were inadequate and did not meet the disclosure requirements to trigger the statute of limitations in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c73s28-73-1005" target="_self">28-73-1005</a></cite>, and the trustee disagreed; thus, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds, particularly as it recognized that the adequacy of a report is an issue of fact when it denied summary judgment on the question of whether reports supplied by the trustee complied with subdivision (c)(1) of this section.

   Although the beneficiary's claims nominally sounded in tort, they were predominantly assertions of a breach of trust; therefore, the statute of limitations in the Arkansas Trust Code in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c73s28-73-1005" target="_self">28-73-1005</a></cite> controlled, rather than the more general three-year tort limitations period in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-105" target="_blank">16-56-105</a></cite>. The beneficiary's allegations clearly involved claims that the trustee breached her duties as trustee in her administration of the trusts.

      <p>
       Beneficiary's claims that the trustee converted trust assets, deposited proceeds into her personal accounts, and actively concealed and failed to disclose her dealings with trust assets and investment of proceeds were assertions of breach of trust; by alleging a breach of duty to the trust beneficiaries, the beneficiary necessarily alleged a breach of trust.

       (a)
      </b>
      A trustee who commits a breach of trust is liable to the beneficiaries affected for the greater of:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      the profit the trustee made by reason of the breach.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if more than one (1) trustee is liable to the beneficiaries for a breach of trust, a trustee is entitled to contribution from the other trustee or trustees. A trustee is not entitled to contribution if the trustee was substantially more at fault than another trustee or if the trustee committed the breach of trust in bad faith or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries. A trustee who received a benefit from the breach of trust is not entitled to contribution from another trustee to the extent of the benefit received.

       This section gave a circuit court the discretion to award a widow her attorney's fees to be paid by two coexecutors of a decedent's estate because (1) the widow's petition seeking a construction of the will necessarily involved a construction of a trust instrument as well because the will devised to the coexecutors, as trustees, all of the decedent's property not otherwise disposed of in the trusts created for the benefit of the widow and the older children, and (2) an action to determine whether certain property was an asset of a trust was an action involving the administration of a trust within the meaning of this section. The circuit court was not required to grant the widow her fees on each particular issue.

       Award of attorney's fees was proper because a request for an accounting was rejected, the petition for attorney's fees was well supported by invoices and affidavits, and an accounting was an issue that was manifestly an aspect of trust administration.

   Although the beneficiary's claims nominally sounded in tort, they were predominantly assertions of a breach of trust; therefore, the statute of limitations in the Arkansas Trust Code controlled, rather than the more general three-year tort limitations period in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-105" target="_blank">16-56-105</a></cite>. The beneficiary's allegations clearly involved claims that the trustee breached her duties as trustee in her administration of the trusts.

      </p>
      <p>
       Beneficiary's claims that the trustee converted trust assets, deposited proceeds into her personal accounts, and actively concealed and failed to disclose her dealings with trust assets and investment of proceeds were assertions of breach of trust; by alleging a breach of duty to the trust beneficiaries, the beneficiary necessarily alleged a breach of trust.

      <p>
       One-year limitations period in subsection (a) is triggered only when the trustee sends a report to the beneficiaries that meets the statutory-disclosure requirements, and whether a report meets the statutory-disclosure requirements is a question of fact.

      <p>
       <p>
   Material question of fact existed concerning the adequacy of a trustee's reports because the beneficiary argued the reports were inadequate and did not meet the disclosure requirements to trigger the statute of limitations, and the trustee disagreed; thus, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds, particularly as it recognized that the adequacy of a report is an issue of fact when it denied summary judgment on the question of whether reports supplied by the trustee complied with §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c73s28-73-813ol1c1" target="_self">28-73-813(c)(1)</a></cite>.

       28-73-1013. Certification of trust.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      Instead of furnishing a copy of the trust instrument to a person other than a beneficiary, the trustee may furnish to the person a certification of trust containing the following information:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      a statement that the trust exists and the date the trust instrument was executed;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      the identity of the settlor;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      the identity and address of the currently acting trustee;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      the powers of the trustee;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      the revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the identity of any person holding a power to revoke the trust;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      the authority of cotrustees to sign or otherwise authenticate and whether all or less than all are required in order to exercise powers of the trustee; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (7)
      </b>
      the manner of taking title to trust property.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      A certification of trust may be signed or otherwise authenticated by any trustee.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      A certification of trust must state that the trust has not been revoked, modified, or amended in any manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      A certification of trust need not contain the dispositive terms of a trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)
      </b>
      A recipient of a certification of trust may require the trustee to furnish copies of those excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments which designate the trustee and confer upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (f)(1)
      </b>
      A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the certification.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (g)
      </b>
      A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance upon a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification were correct.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (h)
      </b>
      A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition to a certification of trust or excerpts is liable for damages if a court determines that the person did not act in good faith in demanding the trust instrument.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (i)
      </b>
      This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.

       (a)
      </b>
      When disclosing digital assets of a user under this chapter, the custodian may at its sole discretion:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      grant a fiduciary or designated recipient full access to the user's account;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the user's account sufficient to perform the tasks with which the fiduciary or designated recipient is charged; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a record of any digital asset that, on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the user could have accessed if the user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosing digital assets under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      A custodian need not disclose under this chapter a digital asset deleted by a user.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      If a user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose under this chapter some, but not all, of the user's digital assets, the custodian need not disclose the assets if segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek an order from the court to disclose:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      a subset limited by date of the user's digital assets;

       (2)
      </b>
      all of the user's digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;

   I am one of the subscribing witnesses to the attached written instrument, dated the

Then, in the presence of the [testator] [testatrix]
   and the other witnesses, I signed my name as an attesting witness. At the time of execution of the instrument, the [testator] [testatrix] appeared to be eighteen years of age or older, of sound mind, and acting without undue influence, fraud or restraint.

    Reporter's Notes to Form 4:
   
   This form is designed for execution and filing with the court when the original will did not include a “proof of will.” Because it is not always practical to have multiple witnesses appear simultaneously, the form is for a single witness. This form is for an attested will and should not be used for a holographic will. An attested will must be proved by at least two attesting witnesses or as otherwise provided by statute. Ark. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c40s28-40-117ol1a" target="_self">28-40-117(a)</a></cite>. If the instrument is a codicil, the language in parentheses should be included. An affidavit is required by Ark. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t28c40s28-40-118ol1a" target="_self">28-40-118(a)</a></cite>.
