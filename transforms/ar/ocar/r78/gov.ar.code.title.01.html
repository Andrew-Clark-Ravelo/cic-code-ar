      <p>
       The legislature having accepted a grant from Congress of the territory adjacent to Fort Smith known as the “Choctaw Strip,” the courts will not inquire whether the legislature had the authority to do so but will treat such territory as part of the state. State v. Bowman, 89 Ark. 428, 116 S.W. 896 (1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the act of Congress ceding the territory called the “Choctaw Strip” adjoining the city of Fort Smith to the state and the acts accepting such grant described the land ceded by permanent lines so that its location could be understood, a mistake in the particular description of the strip was merely a clerical error and would be disregarded. Bowman v. State, 93 Ark. 168, 129 S.W. 80 (1909).

       1-2-116. Amendments to Code.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      All acts enacted after December 31, 1987, of a general and permanent nature shall be enacted as amendments to this Code. No local, private, or temporary acts or provisions and no provisions appropriating funds shall be enacted as amendments to this Code. If the subject matter of any law is already generally embodied in one of the titles of this Code or can be appropriately classified therein, that new law shall be enacted as an amendment to that title of the Code. If it is not possible to classify the subject matter of a new law in an existing title, a new title shall be enacted containing the new law as a chapter or chapters, each chapter to contain a proper designation and descriptive name or heading, as provided in subsection (c) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      A new title shall be created only as a last resort and only when it would be unreasonable to include the new law in an existing title. If a new title is created, it shall be given a name and a number sequentially following that of the last title number. New titles shall be given names which are broad and comprehensive in scope so that each will accommodate the greatest number of new laws having related subject matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      The reserved sections, subchapters, chapters, and subtitles are for the purpose of accommodating future growth and expansion of the law, thereby permitting the insertion in the Code of new laws in their most logical positions with respect to existing related laws. When a new unit is enacted it shall be given a name, which shall be sufficiently broad and comprehensive to describe generally its subject matter, and a number designating its position within a title. The name is not to be confused with the title of a bill.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      A unit should be repealed, as distinct from amended, when an outright repeal thereof is intended or when the subject matter of the proposed new law is more than a mere amendment or revision of the old unit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)
      </b>
      When sections of this Code are amended, the descriptive headings or catchlines immediately preceding or within them need not be amended. When new sections are enacted, descriptive headings or catchlines need not be enacted to accompany them except that any desired changes in the section numbers contained in the headings or catchlines shall be made by specific statutory amendments of the numbers and new sections shall be assigned proper title section numbers by the law which enacts them.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (f)
      </b>
      In the enactment of new laws, the plan, scheme, style, format, arrangement, and classification of this Code shall be followed as closely as possible with the result that the Code and all amendments to it will compose a harmonious entity containing all the laws of the State of Arkansas of a general and permanent nature.

       A cardinal rule in dealing with a statutory provision is to give it a consistent and uniform interpretation so that it is not taken to mean one thing at one time and something else at another time. Morris v. McLemore, 313 Ark. 53, 852 S.W.2d 135 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a statute has been construed, and that construction has been consistently followed for many years, such construction ought not be changed; as time passes, the interpretation given a statute becomes a part of the statute itself. Morris v. McLemore, 313 Ark. 53, 852 S.W.2d 135 (1993).

       A particular provision in a statute must be construed with reference to the statute as a whole. Boyd v. State, 313 Ark. 171, 853 S.W.2d 263 (1993).

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

       (a)

      The General Assembly finds that there are great disparities in the definition of “minority” in the Arkansas Code, and it would be advantageous to have a consistent definition of minority in the State of Arkansas.

      The General Assembly also recognizes that the number of people settling in Arkansas who are Hispanic immigrants or are of Hispanic background is rapidly increasing, and it would be advantageous to include Hispanics in the definition of “minority” in Arkansas.

The twenty-five (25) white stars on the band of blue show that Arkansas was the twenty-fifth state admitted to the Union. The blue star above the word “ARKANSAS” is to commemorate the Confederate States of America. The diamond signifies that this state is the only diamond-bearing state in the Union.

     <p>
      Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the Historical Society of the State of Arkansas and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history and the early usage of the American immigrants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final “s” silent, the “a” in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of “a” in “man” and the sounding of the terminal “s” is an innovation to be discouraged.

      Hemophilia is the name of several hereditary genetic illnesses that impair the body's ability to control bleeding;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Hemophilia is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable bleeding caused by missing or low-level clotting factor in the blood;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      Hemophiliac bleeding may occur even when a sufferer has sustained no injury;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      Hemophiliac bleeding most often occurs in the joints and in the head;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      Approximately twenty thousand (20,000) citizens nationwide are suffering from hemophilia, and one (1) in each five thousand (5,000) live male births in the United States results in hemophilia;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      Hemophilia affects males almost exclusively, affecting one in five thousand (1 in 5,000) males;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (7)
      </b>
      Hemophilia occurs in all demographic groups;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (8)
      </b>
      There is no cure for hemophilia; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (9)
      </b>
      Hemophilia is a lifelong condition that can be controlled with regular injections of the deficient clotting factor.
     </p>

       (a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The steamboat Sultana was launched from the John Litherbury Shipyard in Cincinnati, Ohio, in February 1863 as one of the largest and best business steamers ever constructed;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Its capacity of three hundred seventy-six (376) passengers and crew members attracted the United States Army to commandeer it for use as a supply and soldier transport vessel during the Civil War;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      The United States Army chartered the Sultana at Vicksburg, Mississippi, to transport over two thousand three hundred (2,300) passengers, including over two thousand (2,000) recently released Union prisoners of war from the Andersonville and Cahaba prisons in the South back home to the North;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      On April 26, 1865, the Sultana stopped at Helena, Arkansas, the location at which photographer Thomas W. Bankes took the only photograph in existence of the grossly overcrowded vessel and its doomed passengers;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)(A)
      </b>
      At 2:00 a.m. on April 27, 1865, the Sultana's boiler system erupted in a massive explosion just seven (7) miles north of Memphis, Tennessee, causing a conflagration of fire and flying shrapnel and the venting of deadly steam that resulted in over two thousand (2,000) casualties, of which more than one thousand two hundred (1,200) died from the explosion itself.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)

      Nearly seven hundred (700) more individuals were dragged to safety over several hours and taken to five (5) Memphis hospitals, with many perishing later from injuries, burns, and exposure to the frigid Mississippi River floodwaters;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      Several Crittenden County, Arkansas, citizens were officially credited with saving dozens of lives that night by wading into the flooded Mississippi River to retrieve victims of the tragedy as they floated downriver;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (7)
      </b>
      The event was made all the more tragic by evidence of greed, corruption, malfeasance in office, and dereliction of officer duty, as noted by a following United States Army investigation into the disaster;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (8)
      </b>
      The event occurred in the Mound City, Arkansas, and Marion, Arkansas, areas of the Mississippi River, places where the remains of the Sultana and its lost souls still rest today and where Arkansas citizens were the saviors of many survivors that night;
