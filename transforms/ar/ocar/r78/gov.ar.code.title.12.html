     Effective Dates. Acts 2015, No. 1265, § 12: Apr. 8, 2015. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that there is an alarming lack of transparency in the corrections system regarding information about inmates who will soon be coming up for parole and released into society; that it is vital to public safety that the public know exactly what potential threats exist from inmates in the Department of Correction who will soon be introduced back into society; and that this act is immediately necessary because the sooner inmate, parolee, and probationer information is made available to the public, the sooner the public is able to evaluate who is and who is not a threat to society. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the publicpeace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

      Acts 2017, No. 531, § 1, provided: “Legislative findings and determinations.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and determines that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      The nature of a profession in law enforcement is inherently dangerous, with law enforcement officers frequently facing life threatening situations;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      During the course of his or her duties, a law enforcement officer routinely relies on audio and video recording devices to record his or her movements and actions;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Due to the inherently dangerous nature of a profession in law enforcement, a law enforcement officer's death that occurs in the line of duty is likely to be captured and depicted on an audio or video recording device;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      Absent a compelling public interest, or the necessity to evaluate a law enforcement officer's conduct, or an official purpose such as a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding or an official investigation into a law enforcement officer's death, the disclosure of an audio or visual depiction of the death of a law enforcement officer would have little value to the public other than to satisfy a morbid curiosity concerning the death of a law enforcement officer;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Presently, there are audio and video recordings that depict the death of a law enforcement officer available in various public forums for viewing and sharing which have the potential to encourage copycat acts of violence against law enforcement officers and to incite other acts of violence against law enforcement officers, and which also subject the surviving family members of the deceased law enforcement officer to viewing the murder or death of their family member on television, internet, social media, and other publically accessible forums — causing the surviving family members to relive the pain associated with the death and allowing the public to view and publically share with others sensitive depictions of the final moments and death of their family member — thereby invading the privacy of the deceased law enforcement officer's family; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      It is the intent of this act to:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(A)
      </b>
      Protect the privacy belonging to family members of a deceased law enforcement officer; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>

      <p>
       Given that the statutory grant of authority to the state police in subsection (b) is equivalent to that possessed by municipal police officers and county sheriffs, a request for assistance by an Arkansas State Police Trooper is sufficient to give rise to extraterritorial arrest authority to a local law enforcement officer.

   City police officer lacked the authority under Arkansas law to make traffic stops and arrests on the Interstate. Nevertheless, because he had probable cause to arrest for the offense of reckless driving committed in his presence, no Fourth Amendment violation occurred, with the result that the arrestee's <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1983</cite> cause of action failed as a matter of law.

      <p>
       Evidence obtained in a stop of defendant's vehicle for speeding on the interstate should have been suppressed because a municipal police department did not have the authority to make a selective-traffic enforcement type of traffic stop on the interstate; Arkansas State Police Director's letter in force at the time of the stop limited the authority to general patrol purposes only.

       Lieutenant did not have a letter from the director of the Arkansas State Police authorizing his activities, but he was working interdiction on the interstate to locate drugs in vehicles as a deputy sheriff commissioned by the county sheriff's department, he produced his identification card showing his commission dates, and he testified that when he discovered defendant appeared to be intoxicated, he notified another lieutenant who was specifically working driving while intoxicated investigations; there was no clear error in the trial court's finding that the lieutenant was acting on behalf of the county when he conducted the traffic stop.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the Governor had issued a directive informing state employees of their right to participate in political activities while off duty and not using state equipment, and this directive was posted in state police troop headquarters, discipline of troopers for off duty activities violated their rights guaranteed under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

       This section is not so vague that people of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning; indeed, whatever problems may exist with this section, it is impractical to suggest that it fails to give adequate warning of the types of prohibited activities or the consequences for engaging in such.

       This section is penal in nature, in that it makes no provision for a trooper to be merely suspended or fined, but states that violation of the statute is sufficient for removal. Wicker v. Goodwin, 813 F. Supp. 676 (E.D. Ark. 1992) (decided under former version of section).

      <p>
       This section serves several valid and important interests, among those being to guarantee troopers' job security, free from the vicissitudes of the election process; to avoid the appearance of political partisanship on the part of the Arkansas State Police; and to promote a harmonious working relationship between the State Police, citizens, and political officials throughout the State.

       (a)

      The General Assembly recognizes that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The state has a responsibility to provide competent and thorough child abuse investigations which are sensitive to the needs of children and families;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      It is difficult for caseworkers with the Department of Human Services, which is currently charged with the responsibilities of investigating child abuse and providing services to children and families, to separate their dual roles as investigators and service providers;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      Many studies show that child abuse investigations are compromised when these very different functions are not separated; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      Child abuse is a crime and suspected child abuse should be investigated with due diligence by trained law enforcement officers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Therefore, it is declared to be the intent of this General Assembly to authorize the Department of Arkansas State Police to:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      Create a Crimes Against Children Division, either through transfer or by contract;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Conduct investigations into severe child abuse as defined by interagency agreement; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)

     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      Maintaining the most efficient and secure methods of transmitting and processing information between officers in the field and headquarters;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      The need to maintain and develop the most efficient means of allocating division personnel and other resources, particularly in emergency circumstances; and

      <b>
       (C)

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      There is a need to continuously improve, upgrade, expand, and maintain the division's headquarters facilities and communication and information technology systems and equipment to support the police force and its mission to protect and serve the citizens of the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      A designated method of financing is necessary to enable the division to obtain and maintain communication and information technology equipment and headquarters facilities;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      The use of tax-exempt revenue bonds to finance communication and information technology equipment and headquarters facilities has proven to be an economical and cost-efficient method for financing equipment and facilities for the division;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      Certain driver's license fees have been pledged and utilized by the Department of Arkansas State Police or the Division of Arkansas State Police since 1997 to finance equipment and facilities for the department or division;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      These driver's license fees should continue to be designated as a source of funding to be utilized and pledged by the division to finance or purchase communication and information technology equipment and headquarters facilities;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (7)
      </b>
      Communication and information technology equipment and headquarters facilities are needed to maintain modern law enforcement and are, therefore, essential to the safety and welfare of the people of the state; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (8)
      </b>
      The most feasible and least expensive way of providing a designated source for financing the acquisition and construction of headquarters facilities and communication and information technology equipment is to authorize the use of revenue bonds and designate certain driver license fees to be utilized and pledged for that purpose.

       The retroactive application of Acts 1989, No. 44, which amended subsection (a) to provide that action taken by non-qualified officers “shall not be held invalid”, does not violate the ex post facto clause because: 1) it does not punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; 2) it does not make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission; 3) it does not alter a legal rule of evidence to receive less or different testimony than was required at the time of the commission of the offense; and 4) it does not deprive a defendant of any defense available according to at the time when the act was committed. Ridenhour v. State, 305 Ark. 90, 805 S.W.2d 639 (1991); Mitchell v. State, 306 Ark. 383, 814 S.W.2d 904 (1991).

   While this section does not itemize the standards required, the standards are not unconstitutionally vague because they are either set out under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c09s12-9-106" target="_self">12-9-106</a></cite> in particular or as part of the commission rules. McEntire v. State, 305 Ark. 470, 808 S.W.2d 762 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The retroactive application of Acts 1989, No. 44 was not prohibited by the ex post facto clauses of our federal and state constitutions where defendant was arrested on February 11, 1989, and his motion to dismiss was denied on August 17, 1989, but the trial was held on October 16, 1990, and judgment was entered on October 22, 1990; therefore, the case was pending when Acts 1989, No. 44 was enacted.

       The goal of this section and the goal of the exclusionary rule are different. The goal of this section is to compel police department administrators to check the backgrounds of those seeking to become officers, and to hire only psychologically qualified persons to serve as policemen, whereas, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter unlawful police conduct and compels respect for the Fourth Amendment by removing the incentive to disregard it. Moore v. State, 303 Ark. 514, 798 S.W.2d 87 (1990); Collins v. State, 304 Ark. 587, 804 S.W.2d 680 (1991).

       Subsection (a) does not invalidate any action taken by a police officer if the officer was not hired in compliance with the minimum standards set by the commission, as such an interpretation would place police departments in the impossible position of never being able to rectify an erroneous hiring practice from previous years.

       While deputy had not met commission standards when he was hired in 1982 because the results of the federal fingerprint search were not placed in his file as required by regulation of the commission, that deficiency was corrected by 1984 and from that point on, deputy was in compliance with the commission's standards.

       Chief of police who was not certified during part of tenure could not validly act as law enforcement officer during that period; however, where he was validly employed by the city, his salary was reasonable, and he acted in good faith, the city was not entitled to a refund of the compensation paid him during the period of noncertification. Allen v. Titsworth, 279 Ark. 138, 649 S.W.2d 185 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exclusionary rule should not be applied in a situation involving both qualified and unqualified officers; thus, where several law enforcement officials participated in defendant's arrest and at least one of them was properly qualified to so participate there was a valid arrest.

       Where the trial court denied the defendant's request to examine the arresting officers' personnel files but then held the officers to be properly qualified, there was no prejudice to defendant, and thus no grounds for reversal, since the officer's compliance or noncompliance with the standards was established through testimony.

      </p>
      <p>
       Since a fingerprint check to disclose any criminal record pursuant to minimum standards for employment or appointment is mandatory rather than directory and the arresting officer's fingerprint check was completed but lost and he was hired “in the dark,” his arrest of defendant was invalid.

      <p>
       Where the charges asserted against the defendant were by prosecutor's information and not an officer's citation, and even though the officer had made an initial arrest of the defendant on another minor traffic offense, the validity of the charging instrument and the exclusionary rule were not involved.

       This section did not impose a duty on a county to train its officers not to sexually assault detainees. First, the statute did not create a duty for the county to train its officers on the laws concerning sexual assault and instead mandated that the subject be included in basic training, and second, even if the statute did imply that the county had a duty to ensure its officers were trained on the laws concerning sexual assault, that obligation did not require that the county train its officers not to violate those laws, nor did it require that officers be trained on which violations constituted felonies.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that heads of law enforcement organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain their expertise in new and innovative management techniques and technologies related to law enforcement management and administrative and operational areas. It is imperative that the leaders and management staff of law enforcement receive continuing education to enhance and improve their level of expertise and maintain professionalism. Funds for this type of education are not available from other sources. Therefore in order to meet this need, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from July 1, 1993.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1997.”

     </p>
     <p>
      Funds appropriated in Section 9 of this Act are to be allocated to support the deployment of a hosted supplemental 9-1-1 database service in Arkansas. This supplemental database should allow for Arkansans to provide information to 9-1-1 to be used in emergency scenarios. This database service should:
     </p>
     <p>
      “a) Collect a variety of formatted data relevant to 9-1-1 and first responder needs. Among other items, this information should include photographs of the citizen, physical descriptions, medical information, household data, and emergency contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      “b) Allow for information to be entered by Arkansans via a secure website where they can elect to provide as little or as much information as they choose.
     </p>
     <p>
      “c) Automatically display data provided by Arkansas to 9-1-1 call takers for all types of phones (Landline, Mobile, VoIP) when a call is placed to 9-1-1 from a registered and confirmed phone number.
     </p>
     <p>
      “d) Support the delivery of citizen information via a secure internet connection to all PSAPs within Arkansas.
     </p>
     <p>
      “e) Service should work across all 9-1-1 call taking equipment in Arkansas and allow for the easy transfer of information into Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) or Records Management Systems (RMS).
     </p>
     <p>
      “f) Data should be made available at a city, county, state, or national level to help protect Arkansans wherever they are.
     </p>
     <p>
      “g) Data should be made available to first responders.
     </p>
     <p>
      “h) Be designed to work in today's environment or future i3-based systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      “i) Demonstrate the ability to assist Arkansans with functional needs such as the deaf and hard of hearing, families with autism, physical and mental disabilities, and special rescue needs.”

       (a)
      </b>
      It has been determined to be in the public interest to shorten the time and simplify the method required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      The provision of a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which fire suppression, rescue, disaster and major emergency, emergency medical, and law enforcement services may be quickly and efficiently obtained will provide a significant contribution to response by simplifying notification of these emergency service responders. A simplified means of procuring these emergency services will result in saving of life, a reduction in the destruction of property, quicker apprehension of criminals, and ultimately the saving of moneys.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)

   Pursuant to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.01.html#t01c02s1-2-207" target="_blank">1-2-207</a></cite>, subdivision (a)(2) of this section is set out as amended by Acts 2007, No. 1049, § 33. Acts 2007, No 582, § 2 amended former subdivision (a)(2)(B)(i) to read as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The special election shall occur on the second Tuesday of any month unless the second Tuesday of the month is a legal holiday in which event the special election shall be held on the third Tuesday of the month.”

      </i>
      of this section reads: “The board shall report to Legislative Council in the event the sum held under this subdivision becomes less than three million five hundred dollars ($3,500,000).” The omission of “thousand” appears to be a typographical error.

      </b>
      The Criminal Justice and Highway Safety Information Center was established under the supervision of a supervisory board and the former Department of Administration by Acts 1971, No. 286, § 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1975, No. 742, §§ 11-14, transferred the center and its functions, equipment, and personnel to the Department of Public Safety (abolished by Acts 1981, No. 45, § 1). Section 12 further provided that all of the center's personnel would be granted tenure rights on or after July 1, 1975, and that all position, grade, step, and anniversary dates, as established under the state's compensation plan, would remain as assigned to the position of each employee on or after that date, or as provided by the new compensation plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1979, No. 375, § 1, provided that the Criminal Justice and Highway Safety Information Center would thereafter be known as, and all its functions, powers, and duties would be performed by, the Arkansas Crime Information Center.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1981, No. 45, § 8, provided, in part, that the Arkansas Crime Information Center and all of its powers, functions, duties, personnel, and funds would be separated from the Department of Public Safety (abolished by Acts 1981, No. 45, § 1) and established as an independent agency of the state government, to function in the same manner as if it had never been located within the Department of Public Safety (abolished by Acts 1981, No. 45, § 1). It further provided that nothing in the act should be construed to reduce any right which an employee of the Arkansas Crime Information Center had under any civil service or merit system.

       State presented substantial evidence through testimony from a forensic chemist from the state crime laboratory, although he did not perform the lab analysis for a substance obtained from a controlled buy involving defendant, and the lab report indicated that the substance contained methamphetamine, to show that the substance sold by defendant was a controlled substance.

       While the procedural rule requiring pretrial notice of demand for the right of cross-examination of a laboratory employee is generally a reasonable one, there can be no reasonable basis for enforcing such a rule where it is not possible for the accused to comply. Hendrix v. State, 40 Ark. App. 52, 842 S.W.2d 443 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       If, because this section does not contain a reasonable procedure for asserting the right of confrontation of laboratory employees, the trial has begun, the assertion of that right when it does arise is all that is required of the accused and casts upon the state the burden of either producing the witness for cross-examination or requesting a continuance in order to produce him. Hendrix v. State, 40 Ark. App. 52, 842 S.W.2d 443 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant the opportunity to question crime lab personnel after he had properly demanded to do so as it was a felony to sell counterfeit drug substances; defendant had committed an offense punishable by incarceration and was subject to a revocation of his probation, whether or not the substances found in the two baggies were narcotics, thus, the crime lab personnel's testimony was not necessary to prove the prosecution's case.

        “Duly Attested.”
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The General Assembly intended for the phrase “duly attested to” to require more than the mere signature of the person or chemist who performed that analysis. Nard v. State, 304 Ark. 159, 801 S.W.2d 634 (1991); Willis v. State, 309 Ark. 328, 829 S.W.2d 417 (1992).

       Where the chemist's report is stamped a certified copy and notarized the duly attested requirement is not fulfilled. Nard v. State, 304 Ark. 159, 801 S.W.2d 634 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attestation contained on the face of chemist's report held sufficient. Dodson v. State, 326 Ark. 637, 934 S.W.2d 198 (1996).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Some indicia of truthfulness must attend a chemist report's admissibility when it is introduced into a criminal proceeding as competent evidence. That assurance of truthfulness can best be given by the one who performed the test and made the analysis as is provided by subdivision (d)(1) of this section. Nard v. State, 304 Ark. 159, 801 S.W.2d 634 (1991).

      </h4>
      <p>
       It was error for the trial court to admit into evidence a chemical analysis report which did not conform to the requirements of subdivision (d)(1) of this section; however, when considering the report and other evidence presented by the state, sufficient evidence existed to support the conviction or count in issue and it was therefore proper to remand on that count for possible retrial rather than dismiss the count. Nard v. State, 304 Ark. 159, 801 S.W.2d 634 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Admission of crime laboratory chemist's report, over defendant's objection and without permitting defendant to cross-examine laboratory employees, contributed to defendant's conviction of delivery of a controlled substance, and since its admission was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant's conviction was reversed and remanded.

        Right of Confrontation.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Because this section does not contain a reasonable procedure for asserting the right of confrontation when that right arises after the trial has begun, the assertion of that right when it does arise is all that is required of the accused and casts upon the state the burden of either producing the witness for cross-examination or requesting a continuance in order to produce him. Lockhart v. State, 314 Ark. 394, 862 S.W.2d 265 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state has the burden of producing the chemist or obtaining a continuance when the state has caused the defendant to be unable to comply with this section's ten-day notice prerequisite; however, defendant is required to inform the state that he desires to have the analyst present at trial so the state will know it has the burden to produce the analyst as a witness. Lockhart v. State, 314 Ark. 394, 862 S.W.2d 265 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to show that he was deprived of his right of confrontation when the physician who actually performed an autopsy on the murder victim could not appear at trial and another physician from the laboratory testified in his place since he failed to show that he was prejudiced by the absence of the former physician. Marta v. State, 336 Ark. 67, 983 S.W.2d 924 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant argued that the introduction of a crime laboratory report without the chemist being available for cross-examination violated his right to confront the witnesses against him, defendant failed to give the required notice requesting the analyst's presence. Defendant cited no authority for his argument that he was excused from the notice requirement because the analyst, who was on maternity leave and was not called as a witness by the prosecution, appeared on the prosecution's witness list.
   Jones v. State, 2011 Ark. App. 683 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the trial court violated defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment by allowing a substitute analyst to testify regarding the results of a DNA test performed by another analyst, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; the victim's vivid description of being raped repeatedly and painfully by defendant constituted sufficient evidence to sustain his convictions of rape and second-degree sexual assault.

       If the defendant does not give the statutory notice prior to the proceedings that he wants the person who performed the analysis to be present for cross-examination, the right of confrontation is waived. Johnson v. State, 303 Ark. 12, 792 S.W.2d 863 (1990).

      Acts 1999, No. 1120, § 1, provided:
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   “Legislative intent. As stated in the comment to section 505 of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, ‘Effective law enforcement demands that there be a means of confiscating the vehicles and instrumentalities used by drug traffickers in committing violations under this act. The reasoning is to prevent their use in the commission of subsequent offenses involving transportation or concealment of controlled substances and to deprive the drug trafficker of needed mobility.’ The General Assembly recognizes the importance of asset forfeiture as a means to confront drug trafficking. However, the General Assembly also recognizes that under the system that existed prior to the enactment of this act, the lack of uniformity and accountability in forfeiture procedures across the state has undermined confidence in the system. As the United States Supreme Court has stated, ‘Forfeiture provisions are powerful weapons in the war on crime; like any such weapons, their impact can be devastating when used unjustly.’ In order to alleviate the problems resulting from the lack of uniformity and accountability, the General Assembly has determined that time limits for initiating forfeiture proceedings and stricter controls over forfeited property will help alleviate such problems while strengthening forfeiture as a vital weapon against drug trafficking. Specifically, it is the intent of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c64s5-64-505ol1a" target="_blank">5-64-505(a)</a></cite> that there be no forfeitures based solely upon a misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. However, if the prosecuting attorney can prove that other evidence exists to establish a basis for forfeiture, the property may be forfeited. It is the intent of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c64s5-64-505ol1d" target="_blank">5-64-505(d)</a></cite> to reduce the conflict between state and federal authorities over seizures executed by state law enforcement officers. It is the intent of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c64s5-64-505ol1h" target="_blank">5-64-505(h)</a></cite> to allow law enforcement agencies and drug task forces to maintain forfeited property for official use, provided that the final order disposing of such property defines the legal entity that is responsible for such property. Section<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c64s5-64-505ol1i1D" target="_blank">5-64-505(i)(1)(D)</a></cite> governs those situations in which a seizure results in the forfeiture of money and or property in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). It is the specific intent of the General Assembly that forfeiture proceedings not be structured in such a way as to defeat the General Assembly's intent that money or property in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) be transferred to the Special State Assets Forfeiture Fund. It is determined that such fund can best be used to combat drug trafficking statewide.”

       Long-standing rule prohibiting the admission of polygraph results properly applied where, had the trial judge allowed polygraph expert to offer his opinion that the defendant's answers were not deceptive, the state would have offered the opinion of detective that the defendant's answers were deceptive, and this would have created the very situation which the legislature and the courts have sought to avoid: the likelihood of credibility determinations being made by reference to the unreliable results of a polygraph examination. Misskelley v. State, 323 Ark. 449, 915 S.W.2d 702 (1996).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Any reference at trial to a polygraph test, in the absence of an agreement or other justifiable circumstances, ordinarily constitutes prejudicial error. Hayes v. State, 298 Ark. 356, 767 S.W.2d 525 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       While neither the results of a lie detector examination nor testimony that indirectly or inferentially apprises a jury of the results of a lie detector examination are admissible, the fact that the jury is apprised that a lie detector test was taken is not necessarily prejudicial if no inference as to the result is raised or if any inferences that might be raised as to the result are not prejudicial. Wingfield v. State, 303 Ark. 291, 796 S.W.2d 574 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A witness's veracity can not be bolstered or discredited by proof of his taking or refusing a lie detector test, and evidence of a witness's willingness or reluctance to be examined is also prejudicial and inadmissible to prove consciousness of innocence or of guilt. Wingfield v. State, 303 Ark. 291, 796 S.W.2d 574 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The district court's finding that there was no agreement between defendant's counsel and the prosecutor that a polygraph test result would be admissible was not clearly erroneous; having failed to obtain an oral agreement from the prosecutor, defendant's counsel cannot be criticized for failing to reduce that agreement to writing, and without an agreement of any kind, the polygraph test results were clearly inadmissible. Houston v. Lockhart, 9 F.3d 62 (8th Cir. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for mistrial after a witness mentioned defendant's having missed an appointment for a polygraph exam; the appellate court held that defendant had not met his burden of showing the jury was prejudiced by the referral to the missed polygraph exam and, even if prejudice could be presumed, any error caused was harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Peters v. State, 357 Ark. 297, 166 S.W.3d 34 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a rape case, although the prohibition on the introduction of polygraph results in this section extended to the willingness or reluctance to be examined as evidence of consciousness of innocence or guilt, the state was not prohibited from introducing a redacted portion of an interview where defendant discussed taking the test; moreover, there was no requirement that the entire statement should have been admitted under Arkansas case law or Ark. R. Evid. 106. Rollins v. State, 362 Ark. 279, 208 S.W.3d 215 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Motion for a mistrial was properly denied based on a reference to a polygraph test as the state did not elicit the comment about the polygraph, and nothing indicated what the results were. Johnson v. State, 366 Ark. 8, 233 S.W.3d 123 (2006).

       The trial court properly excluded evidence of an accomplice's polygraph examination absent a written stipulation between the parties. Foster v. State, 285 Ark. 363, 687 S.W.2d 829 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Polygraph tests are admissible only if both parties agree in writing to the admission. Houston v. Lockhart, 958 F.2d 826 (8th Cir. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The prosecution was under no obligation to make a written stipulation agreeing to the admission of polygraph tests results, regardless of any alleged oral agreement it may have made before the defendant took the tests. Houston v. Lockhart, 958 F.2d 826 (8th Cir. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Arkansas Supreme Court has not interpreted this section literally; rather, test results are admissible if both parties enter into a written stipulation agreeing on their admissibility. Houston v. Lockhart, 982 F.2d 1246 (8th Cir. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       An oral agreement to admit polygraph test results would be unenforceable. Houston v. Lockhart, 982 F.2d 1246 (8th Cir. 1993).

      The General Assembly finds that sex offenders pose a high risk of reoffending after release from custody, that protecting the public from sex offenders is a primary governmental interest, that the privacy interest of persons adjudicated guilty of sex offenses is less important than the government's interest in public safety, and that the release of certain information about sex offenders to criminal justice agencies and the general public will assist in protecting the public safety.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of failure to comply with registration requirements under the Sex Offender Registration Act based on his failure to report a change of address because defendant, who registered as a homeless resident of Marion County, was required to wear an electronic ankle monitor with a GPS tracking system; with the use of the GPS technology, the State introduced documentation that defendant had not been in his usual overnight location in Marion County, or any other location in Marion County, for a period of 13 consecutive days; and, contrary to defendant's argument, the evidence established more than a mere temporary relocation to Boone County to periodically recharge his electronic ankle monitor.

       Where the Sex Offender Screening and Risk Assessment Committee found that appellant was convicted of two separate sexual assaults on two separate women, admitted that he had been involved in forced sex acts, could not stand rejection, thought about raping, and said that raping made him feel better, there was substantial evidence to support the Committee's assessment of appellant as a level four offender. Because the Committee determined the presence of a mental abnormality or personality disorder by virtue of its review and assessment of appellant as a level four offender, the Committee complied with the provisions of this section.

   Denial of postconviction relief under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 was proper, because correction of the judgment to reflect the requirements of the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1997 (SORA), §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-901" target="_self">12-12-901</a></cite> et seq., did not demonstrate error so fundamental as to render the judgment void and subject to collateral attack pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1; since the petitioner pled guilty to false imprisonment in the first degree of a minor victim, which was a designated crime at the time he was sentenced pursuant to subdivision (13)(A)(i)
   <i>
    (r)

   of this section, he was subject to SORA requirements regardless of whether it was reflected on the original judgment.

       Appellant failed to state a claim for habeas corpus relief, because the trial court had to enter an amended judgment requiring him to register as a child or sexual offender under this section when he entered a plea of guilty to false imprisonment, theft of property, and domestic battery committed in the presence of a child.

   Where defendant was convicted of a sex offense and registered as a sex offender in another state, and while living in Arkansas for five years he was convicted of breaking and entering and felony theft of property and was given suspended sentences, but all the while he failed to register as a sex offender as required by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-905ol1a2" target="_self">12-12-905(a)(2)</a></cite> of the Sex Offender Registration Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-901" target="_self">12-12-901</a></cite> et seq., his failure to register or report a change of address was a Class D felony, and the state met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant violated a condition of his suspended sentences. Williams v. State, 351 Ark. 229, 91 S.W.3d 68 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's conviction under subdivision (a)(1) of this section was affirmed because defendant had previously been ordered to register as a sex offender in Louisiana, and his failure to do so in Arkansas was sufficient to support his conviction. Flowers v. State, 92 Ark. App. 337, 213 S.W.3d 648 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because the failure to register as a sex offender was a strict liability offense under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-901" target="_self">12-12-901</a></cite> et seq. and the state proved that defendant was required to register but failed to do so, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict.
   Adkins v. State, 371 Ark. 159, 264 S.W.3d 523 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not utilize defendant's failure to register as a sex and child offender as an additional ground to support the revocation of his suspended sentence because the trial court merely entered a judgment declaring defendant guilty of that charge and pronounced a prison sentence on the registration violation for which he was originally given a suspended sentence; imposition of the sentence was separate and apart from the revocation and was well within the discretion of the trial court.

   Section §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-909" target="_self">12-12-909</a></cite> requires sex offenders to report changes in employment 10 days before they occur and this section provides sex offenders with an affirmative defense if they notify authorities no later than five days after changing employment; reading the two statutes together makes it clear that a defendant must notify authorities 10 days prior to changing employment, absent an affirmative defense, and since the loss of employment constitutes a change, this section and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-903" target="_self">12-12-903</a></cite> do not allow a 30-day grace period for reporting a change in employment.

      <p>
       Defendant's conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, or failure to report a change of address, in violation of this section was appropriate because the evidence supported a legitimate inference that he lied when he claimed to continue to live at a residence. The only evidence offered on his behalf was the allegation that he continued to live at the residence without furniture or water, while he allowed the grass to become overgrown.
   Morrison v. State, 2009 Ark. App. 681, 374 S.W.3d 8 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probation of defendant, a registered sex offender, was properly revoked for failing to comply with sex offender registration and reporting requirements, as required by this section, because defendant admitted that he was told that he could not live at a residential care facility which abutted a daycare but he did not move or provide another address for sex offender registry.
   Gray v. State, 2010 Ark. App. 159 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       During defendant's trial for failure to register as a sex offender, the admission of a judgment and commitment order from a 2004 conviction on a charge of failure to register as a sex offender was neither prejudicial nor probative because the offense was a strict-liability offense; at worst, the evidence could be viewed as irrelevant or cumulative.
   Reed v. State, 2012 Ark. App. 225 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's convictions for failure to comply with registration and reporting requirements applicable to sex offenders and for residing within 2000 feet of a daycare facility as a level 4 sex offender were proper where the evidence supported a finding that he resided in a particular trailer that was shown to be within 2000 feet of a daycare facility because: (1) there was evidence that the trailer's previous resident had moved out approximately two months earlier and that the utilities for the trailer had been reestablished in defendant's name; (2) men's clothing and toiletries were found in the trailer, as were prescription-medication bottles bearing defendant's name; (3) the owner of the trailer admitted that defendant had approached him three times about renting the trailer; (4) defendant's father admitted that defendant had intended to move to the trailer; and (5) defendant had a key to the trailer when arrested. Although defendant argued he was only in the trailer to do repair work, no evidence of repair work was observed in the trailer.
   Green v. State, 2013 Ark. App. 63 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence demonstrated that defendant had failed to register his correct address where the testimony showed that he had provided an address that did not exist.
   Morrow v. State, 2014 Ark. 510, 452 S.W.3d 90 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for failing to register as a sex offender because defendant had been advised of his obligation to register, had been informed on how to register, and had been reporting for over 4 years. Despite defendant's excuses for failing to register after his release from jail, the State was not required to prove that defendant failed to register with any particular culpable mental state.
   Fleming v. State, 2014 Ark. App. 235 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of failure to comply with registration requirements under the Sex Offender Registration Act based on his failure to report a change of address because defendant, who registered as a homeless resident of Marion County, was required to wear an electronic ankle monitor with a GPS tracking system; with the use of the GPS technology, the State introduced documentation that defendant had not been in his usual overnight location in Marion County, or any other location in Marion County, for a period of 13 consecutive days; and, contrary to defendant's argument, the evidence established more than a mere temporary relocation to Boone County to periodically recharge his electronic ankle monitor.

       Circuit court did not err in finding that defendant violated the terms and conditions of his suspended imposition of sentence by committing the new offense of failing to register as a sex offender after he was released from incarceration; although defendant objected to the Arkansas Crime Information Center documents when the documents were introduced, he did not raise the Confrontation Clause basis for objection until after the evidence had been introduced and the State had rested its case and therefore that argument was waived.

       Sex Offender Screening and Risk Assessment Committee's assessment of a sex offender as a level four offender based on convictions which occurred before the effective date of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) did not violate the ex post facto prohibitions of U.S. Const., Art. 1, § 10 and Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 17. Despite subdivision (a)(1) of this section, which sets forth criminal sanctions for a sex offender's failure to report, the SORA is not a form of punishment; therefore, the Supreme Court of Arkansas holds that it cannot be considered a violation of the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Arkansas Constitutions.

       Circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charges under this section where defendant had knowledge that he was required to register as a sex offender, and the statute had remained substantively unchanged since case law concluding that the statute was one of strict liability had been decided.

   Denial of postconviction relief under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 was proper, because correction of the judgment to reflect the requirements of the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1997 (SORA), §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-901" target="_self">12-12-901</a></cite> et seq., did not demonstrate error so fundamental as to render the judgment void and subject to collateral attack pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1; since the petitioner pled guilty to false imprisonment in the first degree of a minor victim, which was a designated crime at the time he was sentenced pursuant to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-903ol113Ai" target="_self">12-12-903(13)(A)(i)</a></cite>

       Appellant failed to state a claim for habeas corpus relief, because the trial court was required by subsection (a) of this section to enter an amended judgment ordering him to register as a child or sexual offender when he entered a plea of guilty to false imprisonment, theft of property, and domestic battery committed in the presence of a child.

       Defendant's conviction in the state of Washington required that he register as a sex offender, therefore, under subdivision (a)(2)(B)(i) of this section, he was also required to register as a sex offender in Arkansas.
   Hammock v. State, 2009 Ark. App. 414, 322 S.W.3d 22 (2009).

   Defendant was properly convicted of knowingly failing to register as a sex offender under <cite class="us_code">18 U.S.C. § 2250</cite> because he was subject to the registration requirements under Haw. Rev. Stat. § 846E-2(a) upon his Hawaii sex offense conviction and he had a duty to re-register when he re-entered Arkansas pursuant to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-905" target="_self">12-12-905</a></cite> and this section.
   United States v. Brewer, 628 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">565 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">132 S. Ct. 126</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">181 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 48 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for failing to register as a sex offender because defendant had been advised of his obligation to register, had been informed on how to register, and had been reporting for over 4 years. Despite defendant's excuses for failing to register after his release from jail, the State was not required to prove that defendant failed to register with any particular culpable mental state.

   Circuit court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss related to his conviction under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-904" target="_self">12-12-904</a></cite> for failure to comply with sex offender reporting requirements where defendant, who had been convicted of rape in 1993 and was imprisoned before the Sex Offender Registration Act of 1997 was enacted, argued that the 1993 order did not impose a registration requirement, as required by this section. Defendant was found guilty of committing a registerable sex offense, he was in prison on August 1, 1997, which according to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-905" target="_self">12-12-905</a></cite> and judicial interpretation, meant that the registration and verification requirements applied to him, and there was no legislative directive to apply the requirement in this section retroactively.

   Sufficient evidence existed to support defendant's conviction for failing to register as a sex offender after he failed to verify his address. Defendant had been convicted of sex offenses requiring him to register in North Carolina, which under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-903ol113Aiii" target="_self">12-12-903(13)(A)(iii)</a></cite> required him to register and verify his information in Arkansas; further, by signing an acknowledgement form that he was required to register, he had agreed to appear in person on a date certain to verify his information, but failed to do so.

   Under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-903ol113Aiii" target="_self">12-12-903(13)(A)(iii)</a></cite>, once the State showed that defendant had been convicted of a sex offense requiring him to register as a sex offender in North Carolina, the State did not also have to show that the North Carolina offenses were similar to offenses requiring registration in Arkansas in order to support a conviction for failure to register; the statute reads in the disjunctive.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)

       (3)
      </b>
      After sentencing, the court shall make a determination regarding the defendant's status as a sexually dangerous person.

     <p>
      <b>
       (c)(1)
      </b>
      Should evidence be found in the course of any assessment conducted by the committee that a defendant appears to meet the criteria for being classified as a sexually dangerous person, the committee shall bring this information to the attention of the prosecutor, who will determine whether to file a petition with the court for the defendant to be classified as a sexually dangerous person.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The sentencing court shall retain jurisdiction to determine whether a defendant is a sexually dangerous person for one (1) year after sentencing or for so long as the defendant remains incarcerated for the sex offense.
     </p>

      <b>
       (d)(1)
      </b>
      The judgment and commitment order should state whether the offense qualifies as an aggravated sex offense.

   Sex Offender Assessment Committee did not exceed its authority in assessing defendant as a Level 4 sex offender where this section had not been enacted at the time of his rape conviction, and thus the court presiding over his conviction in 1992 could not have made a designation under this section. Also, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c12s12-12-922" target="_self">12-12-922</a></cite> alternatively gives the Committee authority to conduct its own assessment as to whether a defendant is a sexually dangerous person.

      <p>
       Subdivision (a)(3) of this section, requiring lifetime registration as applied to petitioner, did not violate his equal protection rights as there was a rational basis for treating sex offenders convicted under more than one case number differently than those convicted under a single case number. Individuals convicted of a subsequent sex offense under a second case number have committed more than one sex crime, and the General Assembly could have concluded that those individuals are more likely to reoffend; and the underinclusiveness of a particular provision does not make the provision unconstitutional.

       There was no merit to petitioner's ex post facto claims where he offered no explanation as to how the 2001 amendment to this section, which added the lifetime registration provisions, rendered the registration requirement punitive in nature.

       That the prosecutor or court may chose to combine multiple charges under one case number for some sex offenders and not others does not render subdivision (a)(3) of this section unconstitutional.

      <p>
       Subdivision (a)(3) of this section, as applied to appellant, did not violate due process. While appellant contended that application of the 2001 statutory provision requiring lifetime registration to the guilty pleas he made on the same day in 2000 to two offenses with different case numbers removed his right to petition the court to end his registration requirement, the 2001 provision did not impose a new legal consequence that violated due process. The registration requirement was in effect when appellant was convicted, and removal of the requirement was never guaranteed.

       Circuit court did not clearly err under subdivision (b)(2)(B) of this section in terminating appellee's obligation to register as a sex offender on the ground that he was not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others because he had been released from prison for over 15 years and he had not committed a sexual offense in the past 15 years.

      <p>
       Petition to terminate defendant's obligation to report as a sex offender in Arkansas was denied because he failed to prove that he was no longer a safety threat; an offender profile report showed that defendant had engaged in sexual conduct with his daughter for many years and was good at hiding things. Moreover, he had a lengthy history of inappropriate sexual behaviors with a strong addictive element, he went back to engaging in certain behaviors after his release from prison, and he had a “true” finding regarding allegations of molesting his granddaughter in 2008.

       Subdivision (a)(3) of this section, enacted in 2001, required lifetime sex offender registration for appellant, who had pled guilty on the same day in 2000 to a second sex offense involving a second victim under a separate case number. The Court of Appeals was not convinced that the statutory provision was meant to apply only to an offender who committed a second offense after having been convicted of a first offense; instead, the application of the provision to appellant fulfilled the legislative intent to protect the public from sex offenders who have been deemed more likely to reoffend because they have committed more than one offense and were prosecuted under different case numbers.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      As part of the request for an administrative review, the sex offender may request in writing copies of all documents generated by the examiners, a listing by document name and source of all documents that may be available from other agencies having custody of those documents, and a copy of the tape of the interview.

     <p>
      <b>
       (2)

      </b>
      Unless a request for an administrative review is received by the committee within twenty (20) days of postmark of the advisement of risk level notification sent to the sex offender sent by certified mail and first-class mail or delivered by personal service, an offender fact sheet shall be made available to law enforcement so that community notification may commence. Receipt of the advisement of risk level notification will be presumed within five (5) days of postmark of the advisement of risk level notification by both certified mail and first-class mail.

     <p>
      <p>

    (ii)
   
   Upon receipt of the findings, the sex offender has thirty (30) days to file a petition under the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.25.html#t25c15s25-15-201" target="_blank">25-15-201</a></cite> et seq., for judicial review in the Pulaski County Circuit Court or in the circuit court of the county where the sex offender resides or does business.

       Alleged sex offender's due process rights under the United States and Arkansas Constitutions were not violated by a determination that he was a Level 3 offender because he had a meaningful opportunity to be heard through a face-to-face interview and review by a sex offender assessment committee. A second face-to-face interview was not required.

   After an appeal of a sex offender adjudication was dismissed on the ground that it could not be concluded that appellant had received notice of the Arkansas Department of Correction Sex Offender Screening and Risk Assessment Committee's (SOSRA's) final decision, the court denied SOSRA's petition for rehearing because subdivisions (b)(6)(A) and (b)(7)(A) of this section required SOSRA to send “findings” to appellant, which proscription was consistent with the requirements of the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.25.html#t25c15s25-15-212ol1a" target="_blank">25-15-212(a)</a></cite>.

   Trial court erred in dismissing as untimely appellant's petition for judicial review of an assessment declaring appellant to be a sex offender where the record did not contain any evidence that letters from the Arkansas Department of Correction Sex Offender Screening and Risk Assessment Committee were sent to appellant by certified mail, as required by subdivision (b)(7)(A)(i) of this section. Without proof that the letters were properly sent, it could not be said that either letter constituted a final decision under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.25.html#t25c15s25-15-212ol1b" target="_blank">25-15-212(b)</a></cite>.

       Where the Sex Offender Screening and Risk Assessment Committee found that appellant was convicted of two separate sexual assaults on two separate women, admitted that he had been involved in forced sex acts, could not stand rejection, thought about raping, and said that raping made him feel better, there was substantial evidence to support the Committee's assessment of appellant as a level four offender. Because the Committee determined the presence of a mental abnormality or personality disorder by virtue of its review and assessment of appellant as a level four offender, the Committee complied with the provisions of subdivision (a)(2)(C) of this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      DNA data banks are an important tool in:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      Criminal investigations;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      The exclusion of individuals who are the subjects of criminal investigations or prosecutions; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      Deterring and detecting recidivist acts;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Several states have enacted laws requiring persons convicted of certain crimes, especially sexual offenses, to provide genetic samples for DNA profiling;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      Moreover, it is the policy of this state to assist federal, state, and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in the identification and detection of individuals in criminal investigations; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      It is therefore in the best interest of the State of Arkansas to establish a DNA data base and a DNA data bank containing DNA samples submitted by individuals convicted of sex offenses and violent offenses.

   Unlike the situation in a prior case, the state presented proof that defendant's un-degraded DNA was on a ski mask, found with a pair of gloves, 129 feet from the back door of the house where the rape occurred, and the victim testified that the attacker wore a ski mask and gloves, and that the mask and gloves shown to the victim by police looked like the ones the victim saw on the victim's attacker, and in conjunction with defendant's inconsistent defense theories, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.

      </b>
      Any person whose DNA record has been included in the State DNA Data Base and whose DNA sample is stored in the State DNA Data Bank may apply to any circuit court for removal and destruction of the DNA record and DNA sample on the grounds that the adjudication of guilt that resulted in the inclusion of the person's DNA record in the data base or the inclusion of the person's DNA sample in the data bank has been reversed and the case dismissed.

      Acts 2015, No. 1265, § 12: Apr. 8, 2015. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that there is an alarming lack of transparency in the corrections system regarding information about inmates who will soon be coming up for parole and released into society; that it is vital to public safety that the public know exactly what potential threats exist from inmates in the Department of Correction who will soon be introduced back into society; and that this act is immediately necessary because the sooner inmate, parolee, and probationer information is made available to the public, the sooner the public is able to evaluate who is and who is not a threat to society. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

       (a)
      </b>
      As used in this subchapter, “racial profiling” means the practice of a law enforcement officer's relying to any degree on race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting which individuals to subject to routine investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and substance of law enforcement activity following the initial routine investigatory activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      “Racial profiling” does not include reliance on the criteria in combination with other identifying factors when the law enforcement officer is seeking to apprehend a specific suspect whose race, ethnicity, or national origin is part of the description of the suspect and the description is thought to be reliable and locally relevant.

       Police officer engaged in racial profiling prohibited by state statute, the state constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and the city's written policy and the officer also illegally seized one of the plaintiffs, thereby violating U.S. Const., Amend. IV and the state constitution; the police chief, who supervised the officer and ran the police department, was deliberately indifferent to ongoing and systemic racial profiling of which he was aware and municipal liability was imposed on the city as it permitted the officer to establish and to carry out a custom and practice of engaging in racial profiling. The officer's true objective was not to enforce traffic laws prohibiting people from driving with their vision obstructed or other minor infractions; rather, the neutral traffic laws were used as a pretext for harassing Hispanics (whether here legally or illegally), for obtaining money through fines and towing charges for the financially troubled city, and to provide an incentive for Hispanics to move out of the area—clearly illegitimate objectives.

       Police officer engaged in racial profiling prohibited by state statute, the state constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and the city's written policy and the officer also illegally seized one of the plaintiffs, thereby violating U.S. Const., Amend. IV and the state constitution; the police chief, who supervised the officer and ran the police department, was deliberately indifferent to ongoing and systemic racial profiling of which he was aware and municipal liability was imposed on the city as it permitted the officer to establish and to carry out a custom and practice of engaging in racial profiling. The officer's true objective was not to enforce traffic laws prohibiting people from driving with their vision obstructed or other minor infractions; rather, the neutral traffic laws were used as a pretext for harassing Hispanics (whether here legally or illegally), for obtaining money through fines and towing charges for the financially troubled city, and to provide an incentive for Hispanics to move out of the area—clearly illegitimate objectives.

       12-12-1513. Status as a registered sex offender.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The fact that a person is a registered sex offender or is required to register as a sex offender is releasable to employers and licensing boards;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Certain agencies are mandated to perform background checks on persons who work with children, elderly persons, and individuals with intellectual or other developmental disabilities;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      The offenses for which an agency may exclude a person from employment are outlined in Arkansas law, but being a registered sex offender or being required to register as a sex offender is not listed as a disqualification;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      It is a primary government interest to protect the public against sex offenders. A registered sex offender poses a higher risk of reoffending; therefore, release of certain information will assist in protecting the safety of the public;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      Protection of the safety of the public will be increased by allowing agencies to immediately take the actions or precautions they deem necessary before employing or licensing the registrant or after employment or licensing of the registrant including, but not limited to, termination of employment or revocation of license;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      The provisions of this section are civil in nature and for the protection of the public; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (7)
      </b>
      It is the intent of this section that being a registered sex offender as a result of a court order or that being required to register as a sex offender as a result of a court order may exclude a person from employment or licensure with agencies and boards that are mandated by Arkansas law to perform criminal history background checks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      Whenever a noncriminal justice criminal history background check is performed on a person under the provisions of any criminal background check requirement contained in the Arkansas Code for employment, licensure, or any other purpose, the person may be disqualified for employment, licensure, or any other purpose for which the background check was conducted if it is determined that a court has entered an order requiring the person to register as a sex offender.

     <p>
      <b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Children are increasingly being preyed upon, victimized, and coerced into illegal sexual relationships by adults;
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>

    “(2)
   
   The Child Maltreatment Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c18s12-18-101" target="_self">12-18-101</a></cite> et seq., requires caretakers, healthcare facilities, healthcare providers, teachers, and other specified individuals to report suspected incidents of sexual crimes against children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      The physical, emotional, developmental, and psychological impact of sexual crimes on child victims can be severe and long-lasting;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      The societal costs of these crimes are also significant and affect the entire populace;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      The collection, maintenance, and preservation of evidence, including forensic tissue samples, furthers Arkansas's interest in protecting children from sexual crimes and provides the state with the tools necessary for successful investigations and prosecutions;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians have both the right and responsibility to be involved in medical treatment decisions involving their children, and no one has the right to knowingly or willfully impede or circumvent this right;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)(A)
      </b>
      There are documented cases of individuals other than a parent or guardian aiding, abetting, and assisting minor girls to procure abortions without their parents' or guardians' knowledge, consent, or involvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>
      These activities of individuals other than a parent or guardian include transporting children across state lines to avoid Arkansas's parental involvement requirements for abortion; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(8)
      </b>
      Such actions violate both the sanctity of the familial relationship and Arkansas's parental involvement law concerning abortion.

      Protecting children from sexually predatory adults;

      Relieving medical professionals and other mandatory reporters of suspected sexual crimes against children from any responsibility to personally investigate an allegation or suspicion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>
      Mandatory reporters must simply report allegations, suspicions, and pertinent facts.

       “(C)

      Trained law enforcement or social services personnel are responsible for any investigation and for the ultimate disposition of the allegation or case;

     <p>
      <b>

      </h4>
      <p>
       Administrative law judge (ALJ) said the mother was carelessly swinging a belt at the child and knowingly struck him, but the two adverbs of “carelessly” and “knowingly” were diametrically opposed and invalidated the reasoning behind her conclusion that the mother abused her child, and the facts did not rise to the level of substantial evidence to support the ALJ's decision; the mother accidentally hit the child in the face as he was moving, which did not rise to the level of knowingly or intentionally as required by statute.

      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the ALJ's decision that appellant's name was to remain on the Child Maltreatment Central Registry based on a true finding of abuse in 2002 where the ALJ found cuts, bruises, and welts in photos of the teenage child taken after appellant had disciplined her with a belt and the ALJ focused not on the bruises but on the broken skin on the child's upper back and upper arm and red linear marks on her upper arm.

      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to reverse the decision of the Department of Human Services to place a father's name on the Child Maltreatment Central Registry because substantial evidence supported the decision, as the father drove while impaired by alcohol at twice the legal limit with his then six-year-old son in the car, which constituted inadequate supervision (neglect) and a threat of harm (abuse). The statutes do not require that actual injury occur for findings of abuse or neglect.

      <p>
       <p>
   Order for the Arkansas Department of Human Services to provide a pregnant teenager with school uniforms and maternity clothes was clearly erroneous because the lack of such did not pose an immediate danger to the teenager's health or physical well-being under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c18s12-18-1001ol1a" target="_self">12-18-1001(a)</a></cite>; there was a lack of evidence to support the finding that the teenager was at immediate risk of severe maltreatment and that family services were necessary to prevent her removal, the failure to make findings necessitated reversal, and the trial court's personal recollections were not sufficient. In addition, even if the teenager lacked school uniforms and maternity clothes because her family could not afford them and was kept out of school as a result, this did not constitute neglect that warranted removal from the home.
   Ark. Dep't of Human Servs. v. A.M., 2012 Ark. App. 240, 423 S.W.3d 86 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father placed his child in a car seat in a car on a hot day, the child was left alone, and the foreseeability of harm in that circumstance was clear; thus, the administrative law judge's finding of neglect by inadequate supervision comported with case law; the father lost awareness of the child's presence in the car and failed to remove him, and this placed him in inappropriate circumstances creating a dangerous situation.
   W.N. v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 2018 Ark. App. 346, 552 S.W.3d 483 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neglect by inadequate supervision does not require a culpable mental state because it is defined in the Child Maltreatment Act outside of the Arkansas Criminal Code.
   W.N. v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 2018 Ark. App. 346, 552 S.W.3d 483 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not clear that the administrative law judge (ALJ) incorrectly relied on the criminal-negligence standard; however, the father could not show prejudice because applying the criminal-negligence standard only heightened the standard by which the ALJ could find neglect by inadequate supervision under the Child Maltreatment Act.

       Petitioner was properly placed on the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Central Registry; the administrative hearing was not untimely because the petitioner requested a continuance and the ensuing delay was attributable to him; moreover, the ALJ did not err by failing to consider evidence of an affirmative defense because the petitioner, at the age of eighteen, engaged in sexual intercourse with a girl who was fourteen, and even though the child testified that she told the petitioner that she was sixteen years old, it was not sufficient to negate the finding of child maltreatment.

       Substantial evidence supported the finding that a father sexually abused, as defined in subdivision (18)(A)(iv) (now (20)(A)(iv)) of this section, his son, who was autistic and had cerebral palsy, by allowing him to view pornography; the child's mother testified that she observed the father showing the son pornography on television when the son was approximately seven or eight years old and the son was strapped in a wheelchair.

      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Children are increasingly being preyed upon, victimized, and coerced into illegal sexual relationships by adults;

   The Child Maltreatment Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c18s12-18-101" target="_self">12-18-101</a></cite> et seq., requires caretakers, healthcare facilities, healthcare providers, teachers, and other specified individuals to report suspected incidents of sexual crimes against children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      The physical, emotional, developmental, and psychological impact of sexual crimes on child victims can be severe and long-lasting;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      The societal costs of these crimes are also significant and affect the entire populace;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      The collection, maintenance, and preservation of evidence, including forensic tissue samples, furthers Arkansas's interest in protecting children from sexual crimes and provides the state with the tools necessary for successful investigations and prosecutions;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians have both the right and responsibility to be involved in medical treatment decisions involving their children, and no one has the right to knowingly or willfully impede or circumvent this right;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)(A)
      </b>
      There are documented cases of individuals other than a parent or guardian aiding, abetting, and assisting minor girls to procure abortions without their parents' or guardians' knowledge, consent, or involvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>
      These activities of individuals other than a parent or guardian include transporting children across state lines to avoid Arkansas's parental involvement requirements for abortion; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(8)
      </b>
      Such actions violate both the sanctity of the familial relationship and Arkansas's parental involvement law concerning abortion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      The General Assembly's purposes in enacting the Child Maltreatment Act are to further the important and compelling state interests of:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Protecting children from sexually predatory adults;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Ensuring that adults who are involved in illegal sexual relationships or contact with children are reported, investigated, and, when warranted, prosecuted;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)(A)
      </b>
      Relieving medical professionals and other mandatory reporters of suspected sexual crimes against children from any responsibility to personally investigate an allegation or suspicion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>
      Mandatory reporters must simply report allegations, suspicions, and pertinent facts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(C)
      </b>
      Trained law enforcement or social services personnel are responsible for any investigation and for the ultimate disposition of the allegation or case;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      Reducing the physical, emotional, developmental, and psychological impact of sexual crimes on child victims;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Reducing the societal and economic burden on the populace that results from sexual crimes against children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)

       Defendant's proposed jury instructions were properly denied where she failed to report child abuse to a hotline for two weeks because the instructions were not a correct statement of the law; defendant's instructions incorrectly stated that there was no requirement to report if the reasonable cause to suspect arose after the victim had attained her 18th birthday.

       Prosecution must prove that a person is a “mandated reporter” in order to show a violation of this section relating to mandatory reporting of child abuse; therefore, the jury was properly instructed as to the requirement of immediacy when it was given the statutory definition of a mandated reporter, along with the other statutory definitions of relevant terms, such as “child” and “child maltreatment.”

       This section contains no limitation for a situation where a child is 18 when the maltreatment is discovered; instead, the statute is written in the past tense to include a child who has been subjected to child maltreatment. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction under this section in a case where defendant did not learn about the abuse until after the victim was 18.

      Children are increasingly being preyed upon, victimized, and coerced into illegal sexual relationships by adults;

   The Child Maltreatment Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c18s12-18-101" target="_self">12-18-101</a></cite> et seq., requires caretakers, healthcare facilities, healthcare providers, teachers, and other specified individuals to report suspected incidents of sexual crimes against children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      The physical, emotional, developmental, and psychological impact of sexual crimes on child victims can be severe and long-lasting;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      The societal costs of these crimes are also significant and affect the entire populace;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)

      The collection, maintenance, and preservation of evidence, including forensic tissue samples, furthers Arkansas's interest in protecting children from sexual crimes and provides the state with the tools necessary for successful investigations and prosecutions;

      Parents and guardians have both the right and responsibility to be involved in medical treatment decisions involving their children, and no one has the right to knowingly or willfully impede or circumvent this right;

      The General Assembly's purposes in enacting the Child Maltreatment Act are to further the important and compelling state interests of:

      <b>

      Protecting children from sexually predatory adults;

      Ensuring that adults who are involved in illegal sexual relationships or contact with children are reported, investigated, and, when warranted, prosecuted;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)(A)
      </b>
      Relieving medical professionals and other mandatory reporters of suspected sexual crimes against children from any responsibility to personally investigate an allegation or suspicion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>
      Mandatory reporters must simply report allegations, suspicions, and pertinent facts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(C)
      </b>
      Trained law enforcement or social services personnel are responsible for any investigation and for the ultimate disposition of the allegation or case;

      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      Reducing the physical, emotional, developmental, and psychological impact of sexual crimes on child victims;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Reducing the societal and economic burden on the populace that results from sexual crimes against children;

      All members of society desire the safety of all children;

      The alarming rise of childhood obesity and diabetes is almost certainly linked to an increase in the sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity for children today, which is often encouraged by parents and guardians, including without limitation by insisting on driving their children to school;

      Parents and guardians who have done nothing more than briefly and safely permitted their children to remain unsupervised should not be subject to investigation and possible prosecution as it causes unnecessary governmental intrusion and diversion of valuable public resources.

      Children are increasingly being preyed upon, victimized, and coerced into illegal sexual relationships by adults;

   The Child Maltreatment Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c18s12-18-101" target="_self">12-18-101</a></cite> et seq., requires caretakers, healthcare facilities, healthcare providers, teachers, and other specified individuals to report suspected incidents of sexual crimes against children;

     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)

      The physical, emotional, developmental, and psychological impact of sexual crimes on child victims can be severe and long-lasting;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      The societal costs of these crimes are also significant and affect the entire populace;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      The collection, maintenance, and preservation of evidence, including forensic tissue samples, furthers Arkansas's interest in protecting children from sexual crimes and provides the state with the tools necessary for successful investigations and prosecutions;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians have both the right and responsibility to be involved in medical treatment decisions involving their children, and no one has the right to knowingly or willfully impede or circumvent this right;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)(A)
      </b>
      There are documented cases of individuals other than a parent or guardian aiding, abetting, and assisting minor girls to procure abortions without their parents' or guardians' knowledge, consent, or involvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>
      These activities of individuals other than a parent or guardian include transporting children across state lines to avoid Arkansas's parental involvement requirements for abortion; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(8)
      </b>
      Such actions violate both the sanctity of the familial relationship and Arkansas's parental involvement law concerning abortion.

     <p>
      <b>

   Prosecution must prove that a person is a “mandated reporter” in order to show a violation of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c18s12-18-201" target="_self">12-18-201</a></cite>, relating to mandatory reporting of child abuse; therefore, the jury was properly instructed as to the requirement of immediacy when it was given the statutory definition of a mandated reporter, along with the other statutory definitions of relevant terms, such as “child” and “child maltreatment.”

   Circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of a school district because it complied with The Teacher Fair Dismissal Act of 1983, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.06.html#t06c17s6-17-1501" target="_blank">6-17-1501</a></cite> et seq., when it terminated a school principal for just and reasonable cause; the school board heard uncontested evidence that the principal did not call the child-abuse hotline as required by this section when she became aware of the contents of a child's letter detailing that she had been touched by her grandfather and that she had “bad things” in her life.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      All members of society desire the safety of all children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      A child raised under constant adult supervision may miss opportunities for growth that will negatively impact his or her mental and physical development;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      The alarming rise of childhood obesity and diabetes is almost certainly linked to an increase in the sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity for children today, which is often encouraged by parents and guardians, including without limitation by insisting on driving their children to school;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      As measured by incidences of mental health difficulties, the over-supervised youth of today experience more difficulties when they reach adulthood than earlier generations;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Earlier generations learned resilience by walking, bicycling, playing, helping, and solving problems without constant adult intervention;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians are often in the best position to weigh the risk and make decisions concerning the safety of children under their care, including without limitation where their child may go, with whom, and when; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians who have done nothing more than briefly and safely permitted their children to remain unsupervised should not be subject to investigation and possible prosecution as it causes unnecessary governmental intrusion and diversion of valuable public resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      It is the intent of the General Assembly that this act:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Protect and promote the inherent right of a parent or guardian to raise his or her children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Protect the decision of a parent or a guardian to grant his or her children unsupervised time to engage in activities that include without limitation playing outside, walking to school, bicycling, remaining briefly in a vehicle, and remaining at home; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Ensure that valuable public resources are used most effectively to protect children by providing a secondary review to ensure that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(A)
      </b>
      Calls to the Child Abuse Hotline are properly accepted;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)
      </b>
      Child maltreatment investigations are closed when the results of the investigation indicate that the allegations lack merit; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>

      <p>
       Although admission of portions of an investigator's report to the prosecutor were hearsay and were admitted in error, the child's grandmother failed to show prejudice because the trial court's ruling showed that it relied on the child's statements in a recorded interview in determining that she was dependent neglected on the basis of sexual abuse. The DVD of the interview was entered into evidence independently and constituted sufficient evidence to support the dependency neglect adjudication without any reference to the prosecuting attorney's report.

      <b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      All members of society desire the safety of all children;

     <p>

       “(2)

      A child raised under constant adult supervision may miss opportunities for growth that will negatively impact his or her mental and physical development;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      The alarming rise of childhood obesity and diabetes is almost certainly linked to an increase in the sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity for children today, which is often encouraged by parents and guardians, including without limitation by insisting on driving their children to school;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      As measured by incidences of mental health difficulties, the over-supervised youth of today experience more difficulties when they reach adulthood than earlier generations;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Earlier generations learned resilience by walking, bicycling, playing, helping, and solving problems without constant adult intervention;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians are often in the best position to weigh the risk and make decisions concerning the safety of children under their care, including without limitation where their child may go, with whom, and when; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians who have done nothing more than briefly and safely permitted their children to remain unsupervised should not be subject to investigation and possible prosecution as it causes unnecessary governmental intrusion and diversion of valuable public resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      It is the intent of the General Assembly that this act:

     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Protect and promote the inherent right of a parent or guardian to raise his or her children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Protect the decision of a parent or a guardian to grant his or her children unsupervised time to engage in activities that include without limitation playing outside, walking to school, bicycling, remaining briefly in a vehicle, and remaining at home; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Ensure that valuable public resources are used most effectively to protect children by providing a secondary review to ensure that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(A)

      Calls to the Child Abuse Hotline are properly accepted;

     <p>

      Child maltreatment investigations are closed when the results of the investigation indicate that the allegations lack merit; and

       Petitioner was properly placed on the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Central Registry; the administrative hearing was not untimely because the petitioner requested a continuance and the ensuing delay was attributable to him; moreover, the ALJ did not err by failing to consider evidence of an affirmative defense because the petitioner, at the age of eighteen, engaged in sexual intercourse with a girl who was fourteen, and even though the child testified that she told the petitioner that she was sixteen years old, it was not sufficient to negate the finding of child maltreatment.

      <p>
       Petitioner was properly placed on the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Central Registry; the administrative hearing was not untimely because the petitioner requested a continuance and the ensuing delay was attributable to him; moreover, the ALJ did not err by failing to consider evidence of an affirmative defense because the petitioner, at the age of eighteen, engaged in sexual intercourse with a girl who was fourteen, which was sexual abuse, and even though the child testified that she told the petitioner that she was sixteen years old, it was not sufficient to negate the finding of child maltreatment.

       Father placed his mental capacity at issue by arguing that due to lack of sleep, stress, and other factors, his brain functioned differently than it would if it were not experiencing those unusual conditions, and he was unable to adequately supervise his child; the Child Maltreatment Act specifically excludes lack of capacity caused by mental disease or defect as an affirmative defense, and the administrative law judge's reference to the Act was not error under the circumstances.

      The Department of Human Services and the Division of Arkansas State Police must prove that the Department of Human Services and the Division of Arkansas State Police diligently attempted to notify the alleged offender of the investigative determination, specifically, that the Department of Human Services and the Division of Arkansas State Police used a reasonable degree of care to ascertain the offender's whereabouts and notify the offender.

     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      The offender committed child maltreatment, that is, whether a preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that the allegations are true; and

       (2)

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      All members of society desire the safety of all children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      A child raised under constant adult supervision may miss opportunities for growth that will negatively impact his or her mental and physical development;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      The alarming rise of childhood obesity and diabetes is almost certainly linked to an increase in the sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity for children today, which is often encouraged by parents and guardians, including without limitation by insisting on driving their children to school;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(4)
      </b>
      As measured by incidences of mental health difficulties, the over-supervised youth of today experience more difficulties when they reach adulthood than earlier generations;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(5)
      </b>
      Earlier generations learned resilience by walking, bicycling, playing, helping, and solving problems without constant adult intervention;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(6)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians are often in the best position to weigh the risk and make decisions concerning the safety of children under their care, including without limitation where their child may go, with whom, and when; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(7)
      </b>
      Parents and guardians who have done nothing more than briefly and safely permitted their children to remain unsupervised should not be subject to investigation and possible prosecution as it causes unnecessary governmental intrusion and diversion of valuable public resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(b)
      </b>
      It is the intent of the General Assembly that this act:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(1)
      </b>
      Protect and promote the inherent right of a parent or guardian to raise his or her children;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(2)
      </b>
      Protect the decision of a parent or a guardian to grant his or her children unsupervised time to engage in activities that include without limitation playing outside, walking to school, bicycling, remaining briefly in a vehicle, and remaining at home; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(3)
      </b>
      Ensure that valuable public resources are used most effectively to protect children by providing a secondary review to ensure that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(A)
      </b>
      Calls to the Child Abuse Hotline are properly accepted;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       “(B)

      Child maltreatment investigations are closed when the results of the investigation indicate that the allegations lack merit; and

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

       Substantial evidence supported the decision of the Department of Human Services that a teacher had committed sexual abuse of a minor student and ordering that the teacher's name be placed in the Child Maltreatment Central Registry, even though the criminal charges had been dropped; the ALJ had clearly considered the teacher's defenses and rejected them, the appellate court does not act as a super factfinder, and the teacher could not complain that he was denied an opportunity to cross-examine the student when he failed to subpoena her.

       <p>
   It was error to reverse the decision of the Department of Human Services to place a father's name on the Child Maltreatment Central Registry because substantial evidence supported the decision, as the father drove while impaired by alcohol at twice the legal limit with his then six-year-old son in the car, which constituted inadequate supervision (neglect) and a threat of harm (abuse) under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t12c18s12-18-103" target="_self">12-18-103</a></cite>. The statutes do not require that actual injury occur for findings of abuse or neglect.

While appellee mother was placed on the child-maltreatment registry for a period of time pursuant to subdivision (b)(2) of this section for subjecting the child to a home that was filthy and infested with roaches, her poor housekeeping was not a form of domestic violence.

       Because the circuit court erred by not conducting an in camera review of the alleged sexual assault victim's Department of Human Services file to determine if it contained information material to the defense concerning the victim's accusations against her biological father, which were later recanted, remand for further proceedings was necessary for the court to conduct an in camera review of the file. If the file contained information that probably would have changed the outcome of the trial, defendant was to receive a new trial unless the nondisclosure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

       Order for the Arkansas Department of Human Services to provide a pregnant teenager with school uniforms and maternity clothes was clearly erroneous because the lack of such did not pose an immediate danger to the teenager's health or physical well-being under subsection (a) of this section; there was a lack of evidence to support the finding that the teenager was at immediate risk of severe maltreatment and that family services were necessary to prevent her removal, the failure to make findings necessitated reversal, and the trial court's personal recollections were not sufficient. In addition, even if the teenager lacked school uniforms and maternity clothes because her family could not afford them and was kept out of school as a result, this did not constitute neglect that warranted removal from the home.

   transparency in the corrections system regarding information about inmates who will soon be coming up for parole and released into society; that it is vital to public safety that the public know exactly what potential threats exist from inmates in the Department of Correction who will soon be introduced back into society; and that this act is immediately necessary because the sooner inmate, parolee, and probationer information is made available to the public, the sooner the public is able to evaluate who is and who is not a threat to society. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public
   peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      “Legislative intent. The General Assembly, in Act 549 of 1993, established the Arkansas Department of Community Punishment and delineated its purposes. Confusion in the public's perception, with regard to the purposes of the department, exists and will persist because of the inconsistency between the name of the department and its established purposes. The purpose of this act is to provide the department with a name that more accurately describes its role as an agency that is intended to fulfill the legislatively established purposes of supervision, treatment, rehabilitation, and restoration of adult offenders as useful law-abiding citizens within the community and to provide its supervisory board with a name consistent with the department's name change.”

        Inspection or Disclosure of Records.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Disclosure of inmate records is only permissible when authorized by administrative regulation or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Furman v. Holloway, 312 Ark. 378, 849 S.W.2d 520 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court of competent jurisdiction can order disclosure of an inmate's records, and the inmate need not establish a “particularized need” for the information requested. Furman v. Holloway, 312 Ark. 378, 849 S.W.2d 520 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Restrictions on an inmate's inspection of his records, allowing only one inspection per six-month period and authorizing the Department of Correction to remove from the inmate's file any documents it deemed to be of a sensitive or confidential nature and which would cause great harm to third persons if disclosed to the inmate or any other member of the public, were permissible under this section and reasonable. Furman v. Holloway, 312 Ark. 378, 849 S.W.2d 520 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       An administrative directive pertaining to the disclosure of inmate records was not a regulation establishing an exemption as contemplated by subdivision (e)(2) of this section since such directive had not been adopted by the board and was not registered with the Secretary of State. Orsini v. State, 340 Ark. 665, 13 S.W.3d 167 (2000).

       A.C.R.C. Notes.
      </b>
      The Arkansas Adult Probation Commission was merged with the Board of Correction to become the Board of Correction and Community Punishment by Acts 1993, No. 549, § 3.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2001, No. 323, § 1, provided:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Legislative intent. The General Assembly, in Act 549 of 1993, established the Arkansas Department of Community Punishment and delineated its purposes. Confusion in the public's perception, with regard to the purposes of the department, exists and will persist because of the inconsistency between the name of the department and its established purposes. The purpose of this act is to provide the department with a name that more accurately describes its role as an agency that is intended to fulfill the legislatively established purposes of supervision, treatment, rehabilitation, and restoration of adult offenders as useful law-abiding citizens within the community and to provide its supervisory board with a name consistent with the department's name change.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2001, No. 323, § 2, provided:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The ‘Department of Community Punishment’, as established in Arkansas Code 12-27-125, shall hereafter be known as the ‘Department of Community Correction’.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2019, No. 160, § 1, provided: “The Department of Community Correction may, with consent of the Board of Corrections and the Governor, donate the former site of the Southeast Arkansas Community Correction Center in Pine Bluff to an Arkansas-based nonprofit organization serving veterans of the United States Armed Forces if the proposed use by the nonprofit organization includes services approved by the Board of Corrections for veterans released from incarceration.”

       (a)(1)
      </b>
      When a person is admitted to an institution of the Department of Correction as an inmate or the Department of Community Correction as a resident of a community correction facility, the Attorney General shall petition the Pulaski County Circuit Court or the prosecuting attorney of the county from which the inmate or resident was sentenced shall petition the circuit court of the county from which the person was sentenced if the inmate or resident possesses any estate or becomes possessed of any estate while he or she is in the institution or community correction facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      The petition shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      State that the person is an inmate at an institution of the Department of Correction or a resident of a community correction facility of the Department of Community Correction;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      State that the Attorney General or prosecuting attorney has good reason to believe and does believe that the inmate or resident has an estate;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (C)
      </b>
      Pray for the appointment of a guardian of the person if a guardian has not already been appointed; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (D)
      </b>
      Pray that the estate may be subjected to payment to the state of the expenses paid and to be paid by the state on behalf of the inmate or resident as an inmate or resident.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)(1)
      </b>
      The circuit court shall then issue a citation to show cause why the prayer of the petitioner should not be granted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      If the inmate or resident has a guardian, the petition shall be served upon the guardian.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If the inmate or resident does not have a guardian, the petition shall be served at least fourteen (14) days before the date of the hearing upon the inmate or resident by delivering a copy personally or by registered mail to the warden or head of the institution where the person is an inmate or, if the person is a resident of a community correction facility of the Department of Community Correction, to the Director of the Department of Community Correction.
     </p>
     <p>

      The circuit court may appoint a guardian of the person.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)(1)(A)
      </b>
      At the time of the hearing, if it appears that the inmate or resident has an estate that is subject to the claim of the state, without further notice the circuit court shall appoint a guardian of the person and estate of the inmate or resident if the circuit court determines a guardian is necessary for the protection of the rights of all parties concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)(i)
      </b>
      The circuit court shall make an order requiring the guardian or any person or corporation possessing the estate belonging to the inmate or resident to appropriate and apply the estate or part of the estate as appropriate toward reimbursing the state, to the payment of the expenses so far incurred by the state on behalf of the inmate or resident, and a part of the estate toward reimbursing the state for the future expenses that it must pay on the inmate's or resident's behalf.

     <p>
      <b>
       (ii)
      </b>
      The reimbursement under subdivision (c)(1)(B)(i) of this section shall not be in excess of the per capita cost of maintaining inmates or residents in the institution or community correction facility in which he or she is an inmate or resident.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)(A)
      </b>
      However, before issuing any order under this subchapter providing for payments from the estate of the inmate or resident for his or her cost of care while confined to an institution of the Department of Correction or community correction facility of the Department of Community Correction, the circuit court shall take into consideration and make allowances for the maintenance and support of the spouse, dependent children, or other persons having a moral or legal right to support and maintenance out of the estate of the inmate or resident.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (B)
      </b>
      The circuit court shall take the factors under subdivision (c)(2)(A) of this section into consideration in determining the amount to be paid, if any, from the estate of the inmate or resident for his or her cost of care at the Department of Correction or the Department of Community Correction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)(1)
      </b>
      If a guardian, person, or corporation neglects or refuses to comply with the order, the circuit court shall cite the guardian, person, or corporation to appear before the circuit court at a time as it may direct and to show cause why the guardian, person, or corporation should not be sentenced for contempt of court.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      As an additional remedy, the Attorney General or prosecuting attorney may enforce payment of the sums provided in the original order by a proper action in the name of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      If in the opinion of the court the estate of the inmate or resident is sufficient to pay the cost of the proceedings under this section, the estate shall be made liable for the cost of the proceedings by order of the circuit court.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)(1)
      </b>
      The proceedings provided for by this section may be begun at any time after admittance of the person to a facility of the Department of Correction as an inmate or to a community correction facility of the Department of Community Correction as a resident.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Recovery may be had for the expenses incurred on behalf of an inmate or resident during the entire period the person is an inmate at a facility of the Department of Correction or a resident of a community correction facility of the Department of Community Correction.

       Although the Arkansas legislature's labeling of an Act 814 participant (a work-release participant pursuant to Acts 1983, No. 814, codified as this subchapter) as an “inmate” is not determinative, it does make it reasonable for the Department of Corrections Director, absent authoritative direction to the contrary, to believe that Act 814 status may be more akin to inmate status (deserving of a prison disciplinary hearing before revocation) than to parolee status (deserving of certain other protections before revocation).

       In a dispute between a city and a county over the city's payment to the county of fees for incarcerating offenders in the county jail who were arrested by city police, the trial court erred in its interpretation of the term “prisoners of municipalities” in this section as limited to persons detained for violations of municipal ordinances; instead, the term includes offenders city police arrest and deliver to the county jail from intake until (a) charging on a felony, (b) sentencing on a misdemeanor, or (c) release on a municipal-ordinance violation.

   The due process clause does not in itself protect a convicted prisoner from transfer between jails in the state prison systems, nor does it protect a pretrial detainee from transfer from one prison to another; however, a detainee's constitutional rights may be infringed where the transfer interferes with his right to assistance of counsel, where the state has created a liberty interest in remaining in a particular facility, or where the nature and duration of the new form of incarceration exceeds the original purpose for which he was detained.

      Acts 1983, No. 918, § 16: Mar. 30, 1983. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Fourth General Assembly that the act of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating alcoholic beverages or drugs constitutes a serious and immediate threat to the safety of all citizens of this state, and that increasing the penalty for this dangerous conduct may serve as a deterrent to such behavior. Further, it is found that increased income derived from the levying of such penalties can best be utilized to provide immediate alcohol and drug safety and rehabilitation and treatment programs both to prevent an increase in the use of intoxicating alcoholic beverages and drugs and to rehabilitate persons convicted of related offenses. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after the date of its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2003, No. 1772, § 5: Apr. 22, 2003. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly that the counties, municipalities, public instrumentalities and other governmental entities of the State of Arkansas are experiencing severe jail overcrowding, and that existing jail facilities may not be in compliance with applicable state and federal regulations. It is further recognized that funding for jail renovation, improvement, and construction is extremely limited and oftentimes can be funded only through the implementation of new sales taxes, and that the failure to immediately address this problem could result in the possible closure of existing jail facilities, and the release of incarcerants prior to the schedule expiration of their terms. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

       ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care of an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (c)
      </b>
      Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (d)
      </b>
      Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (e)
      </b>
      All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (f)
      </b>
      Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

     <p>
      <b>
       (g)
      </b>
      Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.

     <p>
      <b>
       (h)
      </b>
      Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (i)
      </b>
      The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE VI Federal Aid
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.

     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE VII Entry into Force
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation, or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE X Construction and Severability
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

       Although the defendant was housed in administrative segregation before his transfer from Arkansas to Florida, when he was released into the general prison population in Florida it was equivalent to a release into the general prison population in Arkansas, and, accordingly, when he was returned to Arkansas the Arkansas prison officials were required to follow the guidelines in the Department of Correction's administrative regulations before reassigning him to administrative segregation.

To these ends, the purpose of this Compact is to provide adequate care and rehabilitation of women prisoners, in the South Central States through effective interstate co-operation.

    (a)
   
   The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, <cite class="us_code">4 U.S.C. § 112</cite> (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        (b)
       </b>
       The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

Because the present general laws pertaining to the militia of the state have in many instances become obsolete; in other instances, sections thereof have been in conflict with the laws of the United States; in other cases, many conflicting, unworkable and redundant provisions exist; and because the recodification of the laws governing the state militia will correct the foregoing; an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in force and effect on and after its passage.

     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       (a)
      </b>
      The General Assembly recognizes that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      Modern warfare and the corresponding advancements in weapons require a higher level of intelligence and skill and, therefore, a better educated soldier. Minimum enlistment criteria are increasing with the passage of time and the advent of new technology;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      While enlistment incentives have remained the same for Reserve forces, they have steadily declined or have been eliminated for the National Guard;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      States surrounding Arkansas have increased incentives to National Guard members, including tuition exemptions and waivers of out-of-state tuition for qualified active National Guard members;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      Other states have lost National Guard units but, because of Arkansas's historically high strength, the state has been selected to receive high-priority, high-strength units, actually increasing strength requirements for certain high-readiness units;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      The combined effect of these factors has caused assigned personnel strength relative to authorized strength levels in the Arkansas National Guard to decline steadily since early 1994; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (6)
      </b>
      As educational requirements increase, there are fewer enlistees who can qualify for critical specialties and as officer candidates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (b)
      </b>
      The General Assembly further recognizes that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      In the absence of additional incentives, Arkansas's potential enlistees and current members will be attracted to active duty or to Reserve or National Guard units in surrounding states;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      While tuition incentives may replace other incentives that have been eliminated and may encourage college-qualified persons to enlist and continue their education, a loan repayment program encourages personal responsibility and long-term commitment to pursuit of educational goals;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      Utilizing a combined program of education loans and tuition incentives for new recruits and education loans for eligible existing members encourages a better-educated population while rewarding bright and responsible young persons for long-term community service in the National Guard; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      An incentive that is targeted as an educational loan repayment has the dual benefit of encouraging and assisting the pursuit of postsecondary education while making enlistment in the Arkansas National Guard more attractive. The program also brings Arkansas's incentives for enlistment more in parity with surrounding states.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Any party state requested to render mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall extend to the civil defense forces of any other party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, privileges, and immunities as if they were performing their duties in the state in which normally employed or rendering services. Civil defense forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the civil defense authorities of the state receiving assistance.

      Whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, such person may render aid involving such skill in any party state to meet an emergency or disaster, and such state shall give due recognition to such license, certificate, or other permit as if issued in the state in which aid is rendered.

The United States Government may relieve the party state receiving aid from any liability and reimburse the party state supplying civil defense forces for compensation paid to and the transportation, subsistence, and maintenance expenses of such forces during the time of the rendition of such aid or assistance outside the state and may also pay fair and reasonable compensation for the use or utilization of the supplies, materials, equipment, or facilities so utilized or consumed. The State of Arkansas will only honor reimbursement claims from other states rendering aid to Arkansas to the same level of reimbursement and for the same items or areas of cost as each of those states' interstate compact laws provide to requesting states.

Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees shall be reimbursed generally for the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed by the party state of which the evacuees are residents, or by the United States Government under plans approved by it. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state of which the evacuees are resident shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support or repatriation of such evacuees.

      <b>
       ARTICLE I — PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency- related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE II — GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.
     </p>
     <p>
      On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.

     <p>
      <b>
       (A)
      </b>
      There exists a history of violent seismic activity within the central United States seismic zone which includes the New Madrid Fault, the southern branch of the New Madrid Fault being at or about Marked Tree, Arkansas, and extends northeast into Missouri and Tennessee;

      That a recurrence of the 1811-1812 earthquake swarm, whereby fifty-five (55) of the approximate two thousand ten (2,010) earthquakes occurring during a three-month period that had surface wave magnitudes of 6.0 — 8.7 on the Richter scale, estimated to have affected in excess of eight hundred thousand (800,000) square miles, is again possible; and

     <p>
      <b>
       (C)

      That it is essential for the protection of life and limb of the citizens of this state, and particularly those approximately six hundred fifty thousand (650,000) citizens on and in close proximity of the fault, that a program be initiated to provide for continuous mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery capability for violent seismic activity.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas: (1) that disasters can occur at any time, as demonstrated by recent tornadoes in Mount Pleasant, Mountain View, Van Buren, and Fort Smith; (2) that State employees who want to offer their services in a disaster must now do so at great personal sacrifice; (3) that because of the great personal cost involved many state employees are unable to participate in disaster relief; (4) that certain state employees already possess many of the skills needed during times of disaster; (5) that this act provides a mechanism for state employees to contribute to disaster relief without losing personal financial support; and (6) that this act will increase the State's ability to respond to disasters by providing instant access to specifically trained disaster workers who know the State's bureaucracy and resources. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (1)
      </b>
      During times of storm, flood, fire, earthquake, hurricane, and other disasters or emergencies, many businesses bring resources and personnel from other states into Arkansas on a temporary basis to expedite the often enormous and overwhelming task of cleaning up, restoring, and repairing damaged buildings, equipment, and property and building replacement facilities in the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      These disaster-response activities may require out-of-state businesses, including out-of-state affiliates of businesses based in the state, to bring in resources, property, and personnel that previously have had no connection to the state to perform activities in the state, including without limitation repairing, renovating, installing, and building facilities and rendering services and other business activities for which personnel may be located in the state for extended periods of time;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (3)
      </b>
      During the temporary period of time out-of-state businesses are operating in the state solely for the purpose of helping the state recover from a disaster or emergency, these out-of-state businesses and the individual employees of the out-of-state businesses should not be burdened by regulatory requirements and taxes that would normally apply to the activities that the out-of-state businesses and their employees are conducting in the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (4)
      </b>
      The state's nexus and residency thresholds are intended for businesses and individuals in the state as part of the conduct of regular business operations and those who intend to reside in the state, and these thresholds should not be directed at out-of-state businesses and individuals coming into the state on a temporary basis to provide help and assistance in response to a declared state disaster or emergency; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (5)
      </b>
      To ensure that out-of-state businesses may focus on providing a quick response to the needs of the state and its citizens during a declared state disaster or emergency, it is appropriate for the General Assembly to determine that certain activities performed for a reasonable time before, during, and after a state disaster or emergency is declared to repair the often devastating damage to critical infrastructure in the state should not establish presence, residency, or doing business in the state or any other criteria for purposes of state and local taxes, licensing, and regulatory requirements.
