       Example:Joe Doe is entitled to receive the income from a principal sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the life of one Martha Jones, fifty-five (55) years of age. There is a emainder estate in favor of Timothy Doe. In an appropriate proceeding a court in Arkansas has determined that the life tenant is to be paid a lump sum in commutation of his right to income for the life of Martha Jones; the court has further determined that four percent (4%) is the rate of interest obtainable on an investment of a sum of the size of the principal sum. In the table, follow the left-hand column, which is labeled “age”, down vertically until fifty-five (55) is reached; then move horizontally until the column headed “4%” is intersected. At the intersection is found the figure: 15.6110. This figure is to be multiplied by the yearly income, which is found by multiplying the principal sum by the appropriate rate of interest. In this case that would be ten thousand dollars ($10,000) multiplied by .04 equalling four hundred dollars ($400). Then 15.6110 multiplied by four hundred dollars ($400) equals six thousand two hundred forty-four dollars and forty cents ($6,244.40). This is the sum which the court would direct to be paid to Joe Doe in commutation of his income right. Timothy Doe would be paid three thousand seven hundred fifty-five dollars and sixty cents ($3,755.60). See § 18-2-106: principal sum ten thousand dollars ($10,000) minus commuted life interest six thousand two hundred forty-four dollars and forty cents ($6,244.40) equals commuted remainder three thousand seven hundred fifty-five dollars and sixty cents ($3,755.60).

        Where the court's finding was in accordance with former section regarding life expectancy tables and was the result which the court clearly intended, the fact that the court mistakenly regarded expert witness as in agreement with former section did not require reversal of a judgment entered in favor of the decedent's heirs.

        According to the actuarial tables in this section, the wife had an average remaining life expectancy of approximately 26 years, but it would take over 26 years for the husband to pay the wife the amount she was due, and it was unclear whether the parties would live long enough for the wife to receive all of her share of the marital property; if the circuit court was attempting to have the husband pay the wife for her share, it should have stood by its order to have the husband provide some form of security such as a life insurance policy with the wife as the beneficiary, or a bond.Farrell v. Farrell, 2014 Ark. App. 601 (2014).

     Effective Dates. Acts 2007, No. 240, § 5: Mar. 9, 2007. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the current extremely harsh remedy under the rule against perpetuities that renders a grantor's entire grant void if the grant violates the rule is outdated and should be replaced; that the common law rule fosters litigation at great cost to the citizens of this state because of its many complexities, with often devastating consequences to estates; and that the revision by this act of the common law remedy to permit the likely occurrence that a grant will vest or to permit a court to reform a grant that does not vest in the manner that most likely approximate the transferor's manifested plan is immediately necessary for the good of the citizens of this state. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      </h3>

       <p>
   Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section and in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c03s18-3-105ol1a" target="_self">18-3-105(a)</a></cite>, the time of creation of a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment is determined under general principles of property law.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   For purposes of this chapter, if there is a person who alone can exercise a power created by a governing instrument to become the unqualified beneficial owner of (i) a nonvested property interest or (ii) a property interest subject to a power of appointment described in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c03s18-3-101ol1b" target="_self">18-3-101(b)</a></cite> or §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c03s18-3-101ol1c" target="_self">18-3-101(c)</a></cite>, the nonvested property interest or power of appointment is created when the power to become the unqualified beneficial owner terminates.
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of this chapter, a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment arising from a transfer of property to a previously funded trust or other existing property arrangement is created when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment in the original contribution was created.
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of this chapter, if a nongeneral power of appointment or a general testamentary power of appointment is used to create another nongeneral power of appointment or general testamentary power of appointment, the nonvested property interest or power of appointment created through the exercise of the other nongeneral power of appointment or general testamentary power of appointment is considered to have been created at the same time the first nongeneral power of appointment or general testamentary power of appointment was created.

       Owner of the surface did not acquire title to the severed mineral estate in wild and unimproved lands by the payment of taxes for seven successive years. Claybrooke v. Barnes, 180 Ark. 678, 22 S.W.2d 390 (1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a primary requirement that the adverse claimant pay taxes on the claimed property for full seven years; consequently, where there was failure to pay on a severed mineral interest (although payments were made on the land and unsevered portion of the minerals), the dominant estate claimant did not acquire title. Jones v. Brown, 211 Ark. 164, 199 S.W.2d 973 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Payment of taxes on wild and unimproved land did not cover minerals since minerals within the earth are not susceptible of enclosure. Brizzolara v. Powell, 214 Ark. 870, 218 S.W.2d 728 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession of surface of wild and unimproved land is not adverse to owner of constructively severed minerals in land. Consequently, payment of general taxes by grantees of wild and unimproved land and of minerals therein did not, as against their grantor, to whom they subsequently reconveyed severed minerals, constitute adverse possession of such minerals. Buckner v. Wright, 218 Ark. 448, 236 S.W.2d 720 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where mineral interest was severed prior to the time that payments commenced, tax payments would not be deemed to cover such severed mineral interest. Laney v. Monsanto Chem. Co., 233 Ark. 645, 348 S.W.2d 826 (1961); Burbridge v. Rosen, 240 Ark. 500, 400 S.W.2d 502 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where holders of color of title to mineral interests are not in a position of hostility toward one another, each claimant can reap the benefit of tax payments made by any one of the others. Burbridge v. Rosen, 240 Ark. 500, 400 S.W.2d 502 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant obtained tax deed to mineral interest and paid taxes subsequent thereto, she did not gain color of title to the mineral interest since she never took actual possession of the minerals by opening and operating mines as required to claim adverse possession of mineral rights. Garvan v. Potlatch Corp., 278 Ark. 414, 645 S.W.2d 957 (1983). See also Gilbreath v. Union Bank, 309 Ark. 360, 830 S.W.2d 854 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two estates, when once separated, remain independent, and title to the mineral rights can never be acquired by merely holding and claiming the land, even though the landowner also asserts title in the minerals at the same time; the only way the statute of limitation can be asserted against the owner of the mineral rights or estate is for the owner of the surface estate or some other person to take actual possession of the minerals by opening mines and operating the same for the statutory period.

       Payment of taxes for more than seven years in succession on unenclosed and unimproved lands confers title, and constructive possession follows the title, and can only be defeated by actual possession adverse thereto. Union Sawmill Co. v. Pagan, 175 Ark. 559, 299 S.W. 1012 (1927).

       Where property was returned to its natural state by 1953 and ceased to be enclosed by 1973, and defendant, under color of title, made payment of taxes on the land for more than seven years thereafter, the defendant's legal title had been reacquired by adverse possession from the plaintiffs who had previously acquired it through adverse possession.

       In order to bar a suit to remove a cloud on the title to wild and unimproved land by laches, a purchaser under a void tax title and his privies must have, prior to the commencement of the suit, paid the taxes upon the land under color of title for at least seven years. Tatum v. Arkansas Lumber Co., 103 Ark. 251, 146 S.W. 135 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to pay taxes on unimproved lands for a long period of time, together with increased value of land constitutes an abandonment and an action seeking equitable relief against one who has paid taxes under those circumstances for more than statutory period is barred by laches. McGill v. Adams, 120 Ark. 249, 179 S.W. 489 (1915); Wimberly v. Norman, 221 Ark. 319, 253 S.W.2d 222 (1952).

       The title to unimproved and unenclosed land will not be barred by the payment of taxes thereon by one claiming under color of title for a period of less than seven consecutive years, and such continuity is broken where the owner brings suit for the land within seven years from the date of the first payment.

      <p>
       Where a claimant's title was defective because of inadequate description in his deed but it was apparent he was claiming title to all of the tract that remained after a prior deed which specifically described the part conveyed, he obtained color of title by paying the taxes on the land for a period longer than the statutory period.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where parts of a tract were conveyed with indefinite descriptions, the conveyances could not convey color of title even though taxes had been paid by holder and predecessors for more than statutory period, and fact that both portions were later acquired by the same person under such indefinite descriptions and he then paid taxes on the entire tract was of no avail where the period during which he held the entire tract was less than statutory period.

            Although defendant conceded that plaintiff met the requirements of subdivision (a)(2) of this section by paying taxes on said lots for at least seven years, there was insufficient evidence that plaintiff's occupation of the property was exclusive, continuous, notorious, and undertaken with an intent to hold the property as against the true owner and, thus, the trial court erred in finding in plaintiff's favor. Thompson v. Fischer, 364 Ark. 380, 220 S.W.3d 622 (2005).
           </p>
           <p>
            A property owner had not acquired the disputed property by adverse possession by placing a lamp and benches thereon and by keeping it clear of debris because a church, which previously owned the property, had not been charged with actual or constructive notice that the disputed property was being claimed by the owner, and continued to use the disputed property for its maintenance activities.Follett v. Fitzsimmons, 103 Ark. App. 82, 286 S.W.3d 742 (2008).
           </p>
           <p>
            Neighbors failed to show adverse use of a landowner's property because they failed to comply with this section by showing payment of taxes and failed to show that their use of the property was notorious, hostile, and exclusive; rather, the use was permissive. The court could not consider property tax receipts submitted along with the neighbors'motion for new trial.Barnett v. Gomance, 2010 Ark. App. 109, 377 S.W.3d 317 (2010).

           <p>
            Judgment ruling that appellant did not own any property on the northeast bank of the river where it flowed by appellees'lots and finding that appellant failed to establish adverse possession was affirmed; appellant's payment of taxes was irrelevant because appellant did not have color of title to the land in dispute.Rio Vista, Inc. v. Miles, 2010 Ark. App. 190, 374 S.W.3d 698 (2010).
           </p>
           <p>
            Summary judgment was properly awarded to defendant on plaintiff's adverse possession claim because the trial court did not err in finding that plaintiff was required to prove that plaintiff had paid taxes on the property; the amendment to the statute took effect in 1995 and plaintiff's claim of adverse possession had not yet begun to run, let alone vest.Cleary v. Sledge Props., 2010 Ark. App. 755, 379 S.W.3d 680 (2010).
           </p>
           <p>
            Trial court erred in finding that appellees acquired title to property once owned by appellants by adverse possession because while the evidence showed that appellees paid taxes from 1998 through 2007 on 30.1 acres in two quarter-quarter sections, the records did not show that they paid taxes on the specific piece of property in dispute.Gibbs v. Stiles, 2011 Ark. App. 302, 383 S.W.3d 453 (2011).
           </p>
           <p>
            Although a landowner did not proffer any documentary evidence that the landowner had paid taxes on an easement area, the parties stipulated that the landowner had paid taxes on the property to which the landowner had record title. This stipulation satisfied the statutory requirement of paying taxes on contiguous property for seven years.Parkerson v. Brown, 2013 Ark. App. 718, 430 S.W.3d 864 (2013).
           </p>
           <p>
            Trial court incorrectly indicated that a party could not claim under both color of title and as an adverse possessor at the same time; the trial court made no specific findings of fact on the remedy of adverse possession but merely stated that the sister's actions were that of a bona fide purchaser and were inconsistent with an adverse possessor. Therefore, the case was remanded for reconsideration of the adverse possession claim.O'Neal v. Love, 2017 Ark. App. 336, 523 S.W.3d 381 (2017).
           </p>
           <p>
            After the trial court erroneously found that the claimant's use of the real property was permissive, the court did not consider the remaining adverse-possession factors of whether the claimant's continued possession of the property after the grantor's death became adverse and whether the claimant proved color of title and payment of taxes on the property or contiguous property for seven years; therefore, the case was reversed and remanded for the trial court to reconsider the claimant's adverse-possession and quiet-title claims.Love v. O'Neal, 2018 Ark. App. 543, 564 S.W.3d 546 (2018).
           </p>
           <p>
            Property owners had not established adverse possession of property between the survey line and the old fence because, even after clearing, photographs depicted a fence line intertwined and covered with vines, briars, bushes, and bramble to the point that the fence was not even visible, and the fence was in a thick, overgrown tree line that was invisible from the adjoining landowners'side of the thicket. The fence thus was not sufficient to put the adjoining landowners or their predecessors on notice of adverse possession.Emerson v. Linkinogger, 2011 Ark. App. 234, 382 S.W.3d 806 (2011).
           </p>
           <p>
            One appellant testified that he owned and paid the taxes on property contiguous to the land in dispute and he was in possession of land lying north of fence through a pond, and further that he cleared and maintained that property, but the evidence supported appellees'position that the use of the property by appellants and their predecessors was permissive prior to a survey being completed, and until that survey was done, there was little evidence that appellees received notice of an adverse use; the finding that appellants did not establish adverse possession was not clearly erroneous.Horton v. Taylor, 2012 Ark. App. 469, 422 S.W.3d 202 (2012).
           </p>
           <p>
            Order granting the motion to dismiss was affirmed, as the decree quieting title was issued in May 2011, the individual took possession in June 2004, and the requirement of seven years'continuous possession was not met.Chiodini v. Lock, 2014 Ark. App. 219 (2014).
           </p>
           <p>
            Appellants did not adversely possess the disputed property because appellees had record title to the disputed tract and had paid taxes on it; appellants'surveyor and forestry consultant perceived appellants'fence to be a convenience fence rather than a boundary line; proof that appellants sold timber once could not sustain their adverse possession claim as the logging activity did not occur over seven years before they filed their litigation; and testimony that 20 or more cattle were intermittently run on the disputed property and that two horses were kept on the disputed property after 1995 did not show acts of possession sufficient to put appellees on notice that their land was held under an adverse claim of ownership.Lafferty v. Everett, 2014 Ark. App. 332, 436 S.W.3d 479 (2014).
           </p>
           <p>
            Appellee proved an adverse possession claim as he showed he began exclusively using a property with hostile intent that was understood by his co-tenants, more than seven years before 1995, and therefore, his claim vested before this section became effective as even though appellee did not live on the property for the entire time since his mother had died, everyone who had lived on the property since that time had done so with appellee's permission, and appellee used the property as his own and threatened his co-tenants.Sutton v. Gardner, 2011 Ark. App. 737, 387 S.W.3d 185 (2011).
           </p>
           <p>
            Conversation appellants claimed to have had with a predecessor in title nearly 20 years after her title had vested by adverse possession did not cast doubt on her title, plus the trial court was not clearly erroneous in failing to find that appellants proved abandonment merely by their evidence that the condition of the property had deteriorated while no one was living on it; the trial court's finding that appellees had proven the necessary elements of adverse possession was not clearly erroneous.Fletcher v. Stewart, 2015 Ark. App. 105, 456 S.W.3d 378 (2015).
           </p>
           <p>
            Adverse possession was found because the purported owner of real property had notice of the possessor's intent to adversely possess the property as the owner knew that the possessor lived on the property for over 10 years, and the possessor maintained and improved the property and paid taxes and insurance on the property. Moreover, the familial presumption of permission was inapplicable as the parties were more akin to strangers than family; and any title search would have suggested that the possessor had title, or was claiming an interest in the property.O'Neal v. Love, 2020 Ark. App. 40, 593 S.W.3d 39 (2020).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where a railroad filed an ejectment action against respondents, who occupied its right-of-way, the trial court erred in not dismissing respondents' counterclaim seeking to quiet title in the right-of-way and alleging abandonment and adverse possession; under 49 U.S.C.S. § 10501(b), such claims were exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board. Ouachita R.R., Inc. v. Circuit Court, 361 Ark. 333, 206 S.W.3d 811 (2005).
           </p>
           <p>
            Trial court did not err in denying the neighbors'claim of a prescriptive easement across an owner's real property because testimony that other persons had occasionally used the road at issue to access the property behind the owner's property for various reasons was not sufficient to show such use was adverse to the owner's interests, the neighbors'use of the owner's driveway did not commence until 2005 and was discontinued in 2010 when the owner put up the pipe fence and a locked gate, which time fell short of the seven-year period required to obtain an easement by prescription.Kelley v. Williams, 2015 Ark. App. 609, 474 S.W.3d 884 (2015).
           </p>
           <p>
            A prescriptive easement may be created over a ditch or waterway and the circuit court did not err by finding that the adjoining landowner proved the elements of a prescriptive easement as to the road and the ditch, despite the ditch being used only when the road flooded; even a member of the appellant hunting club admitted that the adjoining landowner had continuously used the road and “regularly” used the ditch, the adjoining landowner took steps to maintain the property, and there was no evidence of attempted obstruction of the use between 2005 and 2014, a period in excess of the seven-year prescriptive period required.Five Forks Hunting Club, LLC v. Nixon Family P'ship, 2019 Ark. App. 371, 584 S.W.3d 685 (2019).
           </p>
           <p>
            Circuit court did not clearly err in finding that neither the route of the prescriptive easement nor the manner of its use should be altered from the use established during the prescriptive period.Five Forks Hunting Club, LLC v. Nixon Family P'ship, 2019 Ark. App. 371, 584 S.W.3d 685 (2019).

            The plaintiff did not hold color of title to real property contiguous to the property claimed by adverse possession where a street separated the two properties. Patrick v. McSperritt, 64 Ark. App. 310, 983 S.W.2d 455 (1998).
           </p>
           <p>
            Trial court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion for a new trial because subdivision (a)(2) of this section required only that the real property owned by plaintiffs be contiguous to the property claimed by adverse possession; thus, the matter was remanded to determine if that was the case. Roberts v. Boyd, 94 Ark. App. 345, 230 S.W.3d 301 (2006).
           </p>
           <p>
            Because appellants owned property contiguous to the disputed property on which they had paid taxes for at least seven years, they had their own separate right to bring a claim for adverse possession, without regard to whether the court stated so in its order.Mancabelli v. Gies, 2015 Ark. App. 67, 454 S.W.3d 785 (2015).
           </p>
           <p>
            Trial court erred in quieting title to a tract of land in appellee based on adverse possession. Because it was undisputed that appellant did not receive notice of the tax sales, the sales were void and could not have extinguished appellant's remainder interest.Peavler v. Bryant, 2015 Ark. App. 230, 460 S.W.3d 298 (2015).
           </p>
           <p>
            Mislabeling the seven-year continuous possession requirement as a statute of limitations led to the individual's argument that the circuit court could not consider the affirmative defense because it had not been pleaded or argued, but his argument lacked foundation because the requirement of continuous possession is not a statute of limitations, as referred to in Ark. R. Civ. P. 8(c).Chiodini v. Lock, 2014 Ark. App. 219 (2014).

            <p>
         Statutory changes made in 1995 to this section, which required one who sought to claim land by adverse possession to show payment of taxes on the property, were found not to be applicable to property owners whose rights to the disputed land had vested prior to that time; thus, where a neighboring property owner was found to have deliberately trespassed onto the land and destroyed a fence, caused ruts in the grass, and drove over a vegetable garden, all in violation of a prior trial court order restricting his right to be on that land, awards of treble damages pursuant to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-102ol1a" target="_self">18-60-102(a)</a></cite> and attorney's fees and costs were proper. Schrader v. Schrader, 81 Ark. App. 343, 101 S.W.3d 873 (2003).
           </p>
           <p>
            Appellate court reversed a trial court's order quieting title in favor of landowners as the property had been divided by the barbed wire fence for more than 35 years, the landowner's possession of the land up to the fence was visible, notorious, distinct, exclusive, hostile, and with the intent to hold against the property owners and, since their claim of adverse possession accrued before 1995, the landowners were not required to show that they had paid property taxes on the land. Boyette v. Vogelpohl, 92 Ark. App. 436, 214 S.W.3d 874 (2005).

            Because statutory changes imposing additional requirements to show adverse possession were passed in 1995, those additional requirements were not applicable where one claimed possession of land since 1985.Ford v. Howard, 2009 Ark. App. 196, 300 S.W.3d 505 (2009).
           </p>
           <p>
            Although appellant argued appellee did not prove an adverse possession claim under this section, contending that appellee failed to show she paid the taxes on the subject property, a trial court properly found appellee's adverse possession claim vested in 1973, prior to the enactment of the additional statutory requirements in this section, including payment of taxes, and because the additional statutory elements were not applied retroactively, appellee was not subject to the statute's additional requirements.Smith v. Smith, 2011 Ark. App. 598, 385 S.W.3d 902 (2011).
           </p>
           <p>
            If appellees'rights vested before 1995, as the trial court found, appellees had to prove only the common-law elements of adverse possession, and appellants'contention that color of title was necessary for all adverse-possession claims was incorrect.Fletcher v. Stewart, 2015 Ark. App. 105, 456 S.W.3d 378 (2015).
           </p>
           <p>
            Circuit court did not err in denying a neighbor's petition for declaratory judgment and quiet title because she failed to prove the common-law elements of adverse possession as to the disputed property, a prior owner testified that the ditch was entirely within an adjoining owner's property boundary, and it was unnecessary for the circuit court to rule on the additional statutory elements where the seven-year period necessary to establish adverse possession would have vested long before 1995.Morrison v. Carruth, 2015 Ark. App. 224, 459 S.W.3d 317 (2015).

   Since the purpose of this subchapter is to encourage landowners (including the United States) to make areas available to the public for recreational purposes and thus limit their liability, it is reasonable to conclude that a condition or structure which is natural, such as high cliffs, should not be considered ultra-hazardous within the meaning of the §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c11s18-11-307ol11" target="_self">18-11-307(1)</a></cite> exception to this subchapter.

   In an action arising from the deadly flooding of a federal campground, district court properly granted the United States'motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because the Federal Tort Claims Act removed immunity from the United States only in those circumstances in which a private landowner would be liable, and an individual landowner would have received immunity from plaintiffs'tort claims under the Arkansas Recreational Use Statute, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c11s18-11-301" target="_self">18-11-301</a></cite> et seq.Moss v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The changes from the previous provision (A.S.A. § 50-1106) to the current version of subdivision (1) of this section appear to indicate that: (1) mere negligent failure to warn or guard does not invoke the exception; (2) ultra-hazardous conditions, as opposed to mere dangerous conditions, structures, personal properties, uses or activities are required to invoke the exception; and (3) for invocation of the exception and resulting liability, the ultra-hazardous condition, structure, personal property, use, or activity must be actually known to the owner to be dangerous. Roten v. United States, 850 F. Supp. 786 (W.D. Ark.), aff'd without op., 39 F.3d 1184 (8th Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
     Plain terms of subdivision (2) of this section and the definition of “charge” in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c11s18-11-302" target="_self">18-11-302</a></cite> removed immunity only when a fee was charged to enter a particular area; fees subsequent to entry, such as charges to access services such as water or electrical hookups, did not alter the initial grant of immunity. Under the plain language of the statutes, the charge exception did not apply to campsite fees paid by campers in an area that flooded.Moss v. United States, 895 F.3d 1091 (8th Cir. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence held sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the willfulness or maliciousness of the United States in failing to guard or warn against a dangerous condition. Mandel v. United States, 719 F.2d 963 (8th Cir. 1983) (decision prior to 1983 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        In suit where plaintiff-sightseers on a public swinging bridge were injured or killed when the bridge collapsed, in order for the plaintiffs to prove their claim under the exception provided by subdivision (1) of this section, plaintiffs were required to prove not only that the swinging bridge was an ultra-hazardous structure actually known by the defendants to be dangerous, but also that the defendants maliciously, not merely negligently, failed to warn the plaintiffs of the dangerous condition. Carlton ex rel. Carlton v. Cleburne County, 93 F.3d 505 (8th Cir. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lake owner's failure to warn swimmers and boaters of a submerged island in an apparently deep area of water was negligent at most. Jenkins v. Arkansas Power & Light Co., 140 F.3d 1161 (8th Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
     Injured persons met their burden of proof under the Arkansas Recreational Use Statute, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c11s18-11-301" target="_self">18-11-301</a></cite> et seq., by showing that the landowners maliciously failed to guard or warn against a known ultra-hazardous condition and, therefore, the landowners were not immune from liability to persons entering the landowners'property for recreational purposes, as provided in the immunity exception under subdivision (1) of this section.Carr v. Nance, 2010 Ark. 497, 370 S.W.3d 826 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of the exception to immunity in subdivision (1) of this section, plaintiffs'claims were based on a “500-year” flood event that went far beyond the scope of the flood risk of which plaintiffs alleged the United States either was or should have been aware. The limited evidence of knowledge of minor flooding events within a 100-year floodplain was insufficient to show actual knowledge of the danger to human life posed by a more serious flood event.Moss v. United States, 895 F.3d 1091 (8th Cir. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        The tort liability of the United States for personal injuries sustained by a person in a swimming hole in a national park is limited by this subchapter to the same extent as the liability of a private person. Mandel v. United States, 719 F.2d 963 (8th Cir. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant United States did not maliciously fail to guard or warn about high cliffs at White Rock so as to incur liability for decedent's death under the subdivision (1) exception of this section. Roten v. United States, 850 F. Supp. 786 (W.D. Ark.), aff'd without op., 39 F.3d 1184 (8th Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action arising from the deadly flooding of a federal campground, district court properly granted the United States'motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because the Federal Tort Claims Act removed immunity from the United States only in those circumstances in which a private landowner would be liable, and an individual landowner would have received immunity from plaintiffs'tort claims under the Arkansas Recreational Use Statute.Moss v. United States, 895 F.3d 1091 (8th Cir. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
     Immunity under the Arkansas Recreational Use Statute, §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c11s18-11-301" target="_self">18-11-301</a></cite> —<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c11s18-11-307" target="_self">18-11-307</a></cite>, is in derogation of the common law, and any statute in derogation of the common law will be strictly construed.Roeder v. United States, 2014 Ark. 156, 432 S.W.3d 627 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Malice is inferred where the negligent party knew, or had reason to believe, that his act of negligence was about to inflict injury, and that he continued on his course with a conscious indifference to the consequences. Carlton ex rel. Carlton v. Cleburne County, 93 F.3d 505 (8th Cir. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Malicious” conduct includes conduct in reckless disregard of the consequences from which malice may be inferred; given that “malicious” was open to more than one construction, the statute was ambiguous, and “but not mere negligent” functioned as an explanatory phrase, and the legislature used those words to clarify what type of malice had to be shown to preclude immunity from liability (decided prior to 2015 amendment).Roeder v. United States, 2014 Ark. 156, 432 S.W.3d 627 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the purpose of this subchapter is to encourage landowners (including the United States) to make areas available to the public for recreational purposes and thus limit their liability, it is reasonable to conclude that a condition or structure which is natural, such as high cliffs, should not be considered ultra-hazardous within the meaning of the exception to this subchapter in subdivision (1) of this section. Roten v. United States, 850 F. Supp. 786 (W.D. Ark.), aff'd without op., 39 F.3d 1184 (8th Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The high cliff areas of White Rock Mountain, a natural phenomenon, should not be considered an ultra-hazardous condition as defined by the exception in subdivision (1) of this section. Roten v. United States, 850 F. Supp. 786 (W.D. Ark.), aff'd without op., 39 F.3d 1184 (8th Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whereas the cliffs areas in White Rock Mountain, from which at least four people have fallen, posed an obvious danger, the collapse of the swinging bridge was an unforeseen occurrence. Carlton ex rel. Carlton v. Cleburne County, 93 F.3d 505 (8th Cir. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is an obvious danger associated with diving into water at night when one has not tested the water to see how deep it is; therefore an unexpected shallow area cannot be considered an ultra-hazardous condition in and of itself which requires a warning. Jenkins v. Arkansas Power & Light Co., 140 F.3d 1161 (8th Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) rider was injured when the rider drove the ATV into a steel cable on the landowners'property, it was not the hanging of a cable per se that constituted the ultra-hazardous activity, but the hanging of an unmarked cable at a dangerous height in an area in which the landowners knew there were people traveling on ATVs.Carr v. Nance, 2010 Ark. 497, 370 S.W.3d 826 (2010).

          Effective Dates. Acts 1999, No. 1380, § 7: Apr. 13, 1999. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-second General Assembly that there is an immediate and urgent need for revision of the current state law concerning enforcement of interior setback restrictions in residential restrictive covenants. Recent court decisions appear to hold that any violation of such an interior setback restriction, no matter how slight, requires that the structure or part thereof built in violation of the setback restriction be removed. Such an interpretation of the law regarding interior setback restrictions in residential restrictive covenants will result in the needless destruction of property, with resultant displacement of homeowners and their families and substantial expenditures to correct setback restriction violations which, in actuality, cause little or no damage to adjacent land owners. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Effective Dates. Acts 2005, No. 1977, § 2: Apr. 11, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that there is nothing currently in the law that grants immunity from liability to persons who make property available for municipal water supply purposes; that this act provides sound public policy for the State of Arkansas; and that this act is immediately necessary because the state should encourage property owners to make property available for municipal water supply purposes. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

        A grantor of real estate is not responsible on the statutory covenant implied by the use of the words “grant, bargain and sell” for encumbrances other than those done or suffered by himself. Winston v. Vaughan, 22 Ark. 72 (1860).
       </p>
       <p>
        Words “grant, bargain and sell” in a deed granting a life estate created a covenant or warranty that the grantor was seized of an indefeasible estate in fee simple. A trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the life estate grantee's claims for breach of warranty, estoppel by deed, and conversion, although defendants did not own the property at the time they granted the life estate; defendants clearly made warranties to the grantee and should have been required to honor them.Jackson v. Smith, 2010 Ark. App. 681, 380 S.W.3d 443 (2010).

     Although the Supreme Court held in O'Bar v. Hight, 169 Ark. 1008, 277 S.W. 533 (1925), that a covenantee could not recover attorney's fees from the covenantor in an action for breach of warranty, the 1989 amendment to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c22s16-22-308" target="_blank">16-22-308</a></cite> permitted a trial court to allow a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party in an action for breach of contract. Murchie v. Hinton, 41 Ark. App. 84, 848 S.W.2d 436 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grantees in a deed containing covenants against encumbrances, who permitted the land to be sold under prior liens against the grantor and procured a purchaser to protect their title, were permitted to recoup from the purchase money the amount expended in removing the encumbrances but could not claim title in the purchaser to defeat recovery by the grantor of the residue of the purchase money. Brodie v. Watkins, 31 Ark. 319 (1876).
       </p>
       <p>
        The grantor is not bound to defend against the subsequent confirmation of a tax sale for forfeiture at time of deed and may show in a suit against him on his warranty that the forfeiture and sale for taxes were void. Lonergan v. Baber, 59 Ark. 15, 26 S.W. 13 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        An outstanding lease of part of the property conveyed will break the covenant against encumbrances as to the entire tract. Crawford v. McDonald, 84 Ark. 415, 106 S.W. 206 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        A covenant for quiet enjoyment was broken where a title paramount to that of the grantee's was held valid in a suit against them to which their grantor was a party. Gibbons v. Moore, 98 Ark. 501, 136 S.W. 937 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Covenant of warranty is implied by this section and, in order to recover for breach of such covenant, an eviction, either actual or constructive, must be alleged and proven. Bosnick v. Hill, 292 Ark. 505, 731 S.W.2d 204 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Seisin is a covenant which is broken as soon as made, if grantor has not possession, right of possession, and complete title. Grantors were to pay costs and expenses reasonably incurred by grantees for their successful efforts in vindicating their rights under covenant of seisin given them by grantors. Bosnick v. Hill, 292 Ark. 505, 731 S.W.2d 204 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where landowner was evicted from a portion of her lot by a temporary restraining order, which eviction continued until the conclusion of a final hearing, landowner was entitled to recoup litigation costs and expenses from the grantor for breach of covenant in successfully defending an adverse possession suit and recovering possession of the disputed portion of lot. Murchie v. Hinton, 41 Ark. App. 84, 848 S.W.2d 436 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A general covenant of warranty in a deed will not be held to cover an improvement assessment which became a lien upon the land subsequent to the execution of the deed. Blakemore v. Covey, 173 Ark. 722, 293 S.W. 39 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        The deed of an infant will pass his estate subject to disaffirmance after majority, but his covenants are void. Bagley v. Fletcher, 44 Ark. 153 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        A quitclaim deed is a substantive mode of conveyance and is as effectual to carry all the right, title, interest, claim and estate of the grantor as a deed with full covenants, although the grantee has no possession of or prior interest in the land. Bagley v. Fletcher, 44 Ark. 153 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed using the words “bargain, sell and quitclaim” omitting the statutory words of warranty and containing no express covenant of warranty is a mere quitclaim deed, insufficient to convey after-acquired title. Holmes v. Countiss, 195 Ark. 1014, 115 S.W.2d 553 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where words “convey and quitclaim” appeared in deed in addition to statutory words “grant, bargain, and sell,” the deed was a quitclaim deed and not a conveyance in fee simple. Chavis v. Hill, 216 Ark. 136, 224 S.W.2d 808 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed conveying the title of land in fee simple carries with it the right to collect the rents; and, unless the deed reserves the right in the grantor to collect and use the rents, these pass as a necessary incident with the land to the grantee. McPherson v. Johnson, 270 Ark. 926, 606 S.W.2d 613 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no mention was made of the rents as being a part of the consideration, no reservation of rents was made in either the sales contract or in the deed. McPherson v. Johnson, 270 Ark. 926, 606 S.W.2d 613 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since rent is an interest in realty, it can be alienated by way of a mortgage to take effect immediately. First Fed. Sav. v. City Nat'l Bank, 87 B.R. 565 (W.D. Ark. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The words “grant, bargain and sell” employed in the assignment of a bond for title do not import (nor does the act of assignment imply) a covenant that the vendor will comply with his contract to convey, but merely that he is the owner of the bond for title, and to invest the assignee therewith. Hazer v. Yost, 54 Ark. 485, 16 S.W. 372 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        Words to the effect that a certain party “was the absolute owner” are not words of conveyance and have no effect whatever to place title in him. Griffith v. Ayer-Lord Tie Co., 109 Ark. 223, 159 S.W. 218 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to transfer title to standing timber, it is absolutely necessary that words “grant, bargain and sell,” or words of the same purport be expressed in the instrument. Griffith v. Ayer-Lord Tie Co., 109 Ark. 223, 159 S.W. 218 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Words “bargain, sell and quitclaim,” as used in a deed, do not have the same import as “grant, bargain and sell” used in this section. Holmes v. Countiss, 195 Ark. 1014, 115 S.W.2d 553 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mineral deed from 1929 effectively conveyed 100 percent of a mineral interest because the statutory language required an interpretation that there was a 100 percent conveyance, and the mineral deed contained no language that appeared to limit the conveyance. Moreover, alleged deficiencies contained in the 1929 deed did not overcome the grantors'intent to convey 100 percent of the mineral interest, and 13 blank spaces did not undermine that intent.Barton Land Servs. v. SEECO, Inc., 2013 Ark. 231, 428 S.W.3d 430 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is inapplicable where the habendum clause contains a statement of claims against which title is warranted. Doak v. Smith, 137 Ark. 509, 208 S.W. 795 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the word “quitclaim,” or any words other than statutory words “grant, bargain, and sell,” appear in the granting clause of the deed, then presence of such other words, if inconsistent with statutory words, will prevent conveyance from conveying title in fee simple. Chavis v. Hill, 216 Ark. 136, 224 S.W.2d 808 (1949).

        Although appellants argued that the creation of overlay zones was unreasonable because this section required a 100% vote of the owners of the property owners association for passage, the appellate court did not reach the merits of the argument because the circuit court did not consider it or rule on it.Garner v. Bd. of Dirs., Hot Springs Village Property Owners Ass'n, 2017 Ark. App. 539, 531 S.W.3d 438 (2017).

        A restrictive covenant could not be enforced based solely on a general plan of development in the absence of restrictions in the grantee's chain of title. Knowles v. Anderson, 307 Ark. 393, 821 S.W.2d 466 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restrictive covenant prohibiting the subdividing of lots in phase one of a subdivision did not apply to appellees'phase two property; there were no restrictions clearly applicable to phase two property and the ambiguity was resolved in favor of appellees and defeated the contention that the plat alone adopted phase one restrictions for phase two property.Estes v. Merritt, 96 Ark. App. 380, 242 S.W.3d 295 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Covenant limiting the use of each lot to a single family residence and incidental outbuildings was not void as an unreasonable restraint on alienation where the developer was aware of the conditions and requirements when it purchased the property and it failed to show that there had been a change in conditions sufficient to warrant invalidation of the covenant.Royal Oaks Vista LLC v. Maddox, 372 Ark. 119, 271 S.W.3d 479 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restrictive covenant could be enforced against one who took deed with knowledge of restriction even though developers had not filed a plat as required by this section. Jones v. Cook, 271 Ark. 870, 611 S.W.2d 506 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A bill of assurance which limited certain land uses was ineffective against second purchaser's use of the land where, at the time the vendors filed the bill of assurance, they had already conveyed the property to the first purchaser even though the first purchaser subsequently conveyed the property back to the original vendor. White v. Cordes, 14 Ark. App. 104, 685 S.W.2d 524 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both the bylaws and rules and regulations were validly incorporated in the covenant, and while the bylaws were not created until nine years after the declarations were filed, the bylaws simply provided details and amendments to issues contemplated in the declarations; there was enough information in the declarations to allow a purchaser to make an inquiry and thus the bylaws and rules and regulations were sufficiently referenced in the declarations to be incorporated.Dye v. Diamante, 2017 Ark. 42, 510 S.W.3d 759 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase “owners of the real property,” did not require mineral owners to join in the execution of bills of assurance before covenants could affect the use of real property. McGuire v. Bell, 297 Ark. 282, 761 S.W.2d 904 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Two property owners were not bound by restrictive covenants they did not sign; at the time the owners entered into their contract to purchase the property, the land-use restrictions had not been executed, and they were executed later without the owners'signatures. The signature requirement was not negated by the owners'alleged knowledge of the restrictions, which was based on a sentence in their agreement for deed; nor did the fact that the owners purchased the property pursuant to a contract for deed mean that they were not “owners” for purposes of this section.Akers v. Butler, 2015 Ark. App. 650, 476 S.W.3d 183 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restrictive covenants pertaining to a subdivision were neither valid nor effective where only one of several property owners signed the restrictive covenants document. Forrest Constr., Inc. v. Milam, 345 Ark. 1, 43 S.W.3d 140 (2001).

       18-12-103. Restrictive covenants — Definition.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      As used in this section, “restrictive covenant” means a restriction on the use or development of real property regardless of whether the restriction is created by a covenant in a deed or bill of assurance, or by any other instrument.
     </p>
     <p>
      An instrument creating a restrictive covenant is not effective to restrict the use or development of real property unless the instrument purporting to restrict the use or development of the real property is executed by the owners of the real property and recorded in the office of the recorder of the county in which the property is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the instrument creating a restrictive covenant contains separate sections stating the duration of the covenant and the requirements for amending the covenant, the section or sections stating the duration of the covenant shall be read independently of the section or sections stating the requirements for amending the covenant so that the duration of the covenant does not limit the ability to amend a restrictive covenant at any time.

       A deed for lands executed not in the presence of witnesses, but acknowledged as required by law, is sufficient authentication; no subscribing witnesses are necessary where the execution is duly acknowledged. Another method of authenticating deeds and instruments for conveyance is by the testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses, when the deed must be executed in the presence of two witnesses or acknowledged by the grantor in their presence when executed before them. Either method is effectual. Cocke v. Brogan, 5 Ark. 693 (1844).

       Where the granting clause conveys the land described to the grantee in fee simple, a proviso in the habendum clause limiting the estate conveyed in certain contingencies to a life estate is repugnant to the granting clause and void. Carllee v. Ellsberry, 82 Ark. 209, 101 S.W. 407 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the granting clause contains no words of inheritance and the conveyance is not expressly stated to be in fee simple, a limitation in the habendum is not repugnant and declares the grantor's intention and will rebut any implication which would otherwise arise from the omission in the granting clause. McDill v. Meyer, 94 Ark. 615, 128 S.W. 364 (1910); Fender v. Rogers, 185 Ark. 191, 46 S.W.2d 804 (1932).

       Mineral deed from 1929 effectively conveyed 100 percent of a mineral interest because the statutory language required an interpretation that there was a 100 percent conveyance, and the mineral deed contained no language that appeared to limit the conveyance.

       Furthermore, all conveyances of real property made prior to July 15, 1991, and which clearly intended that the interests were conveyed as joint tenancy with right of survivorship even though the grantees were not husband and wife shall be deemed to have created joint tenancies with right of survivorship.
       <p>
        With respect to conveyances prior to July 15, 1991, subsection (c) of this section provides that a joint tenancy with right of survivorship was created if it was “clearly intended”; the question whether a survivorship interest was intended should be determined from the four corners of the deed. Brissett v. Sykes, 313 Ark. 515, 855 S.W.2d 330 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed which did not stop with describing the purchasers as husband and wife but went further and stated that they were to hold “as tenants by the entirety” was sufficient to establish a joint tenancy with right of survivorship; merely describing the purchasers as “husband and wife” was insufficient to establish an intent to create a survivorship interest. Brissett v. Sykes, 313 Ark. 515, 855 S.W.2d 330 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in converting a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common and in disposing of two identically titled properties in different ways when title to both properties passed to appellant as the surviving joint tenant. The parties'settlement agreement, in which they agreed to sell the property at some point in the future, did not convert ownership of the properties to a tenancy in common.Farrow v. Fuller, 2017 Ark.

            Declarations were properly recorded in 1997; this section, enacted in 2011, by its very terms does not specifically invalidate transfer fees recorded before the 2011 act, and thus the trial court did not err in declaring the transfer fees enforceable.Dye v. Diamante, 2017 Ark. 42, 510 S.W.3d 759 (2017).
           </p>
           <p>
            This section destroys a contractual right to apply transfer fees to property, and is therefore not remedial or procedural.Dye v. Diamante, 2017 Ark. 42, 510 S.W.3d 759 (2017).

       Where neither the offer and acceptance nor the purchaser's agreement were acknowledged, they were not recordable and therefore the purchasers of the realty were without means of giving record notice to the world of their equitable interest in the property.

       A recorded lease which was not acknowledged would not be constructive notice; however the fact that it was recorded might be considered in determining whether the purchaser had actual notice before purchasing. Prince v. Alford, 173 Ark. 633, 293 S.W. 36 (1927).

       Unacknowledged lease was not valid against purchasers who had no actual knowledge of the lease and could not be charged with constructive notice. George v. George, 267 Ark. 823, 591 S.W.2d 655 (Ct. App. 1979).

            An acknowledgment taken by an officer who was a party to the deed does not entitle the instrument to record, and a record of it will impart no notice to subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers; however, the defect may be cured by a proper curative statute. Green v. Abraham, 43 Ark. 420 (1884).

           <p>
            A notary public is not disqualified to take an acknowledgment to a mortgage by reason of the fact that he had acted as agent for the mortgagor in obtaining the loan of money which the mortgage was intended to secure. Penn v. Garvin, 56 Ark. 511, 20 S.W. 410 (1892).

       <p>
        The certificate of a clerk of a court of record of another state to the acknowledgment of the execution of a deed is admissible as evidence without attestation of his official character by the judge of the court. Ferguson v. Peden, 33 Ark. 150 (1878).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is in fact an appearance and acknowledgment of a deed in some manner, then the official certificate of acknowledgment is conclusive of every fact appearing on its face, and evidence of what passed at the time of the acknowledgment is inadmissible to impeach the certificate, except in case of fraud or imposition in obtaining the acknowledgment, and where knowledge or notice of the fraud or imposition is brought home to the grantee. Holt v. Moore, 37 Ark. 145 (1881); Meyer v. Gossett, 38 Ark. 377 (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not sufficient for the officer to certify in general terms that the deed was proved; it should appear from the certificate that the witness was sworn, and that he stated that the party whose name appears to the deed signed it, or executed it, or acknowledged that he had done so, or some such language amounting to proof of the execution of the deed. And it must appear that such proof was made by one of the attesting witnesses, unless it is made to appear that the subscribing witnesses are dead or cannot be had. Trammell v. Thurmond, 17 Ark. 203 (1856).
       </p>
       <p>
        The absence from a notary's seal of the emblems and devices required by the statute does not invalidate his certificate of the acknowledgment of a deed. Sonfield v. Thompson, 42 Ark. 46 (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        An acknowledgment to the execution of a deed of trust is invalid if the notary does not sign his name thereto, although he does affix the imprint of his official seal. Davis v. Hale, 114 Ark. 426, 170 S.W. 99 (1914).

          The acknowledgment must show that the deed was executed “for the consideration and purposes” therein expressed. The words “consideration” and “purposes” are both material, and if either is omitted, and no word of similar import is used, the acknowledgment is insufficient. Johnson v. Godden, 33 Ark. 600 (1878); Ford v. Burks, 37 Ark. 91 (1881); Drew County Bank & Trust Co. v. Sorben, 181 Ark. 943, 28 S.W.2d 730 (1930); Donham v. Davis, 208 Ark. 824, 187 S.W.2d 722 (1945).
         </p>
         <p>
          The word “uses” is not of similar import or substantially the same as the word “consideration” required by this section. Martin v. O'Bannon, 35 Ark. 62 (1879).
         </p>
         <p>
          If the acknowledgment fails to state the consideration, the mortgage, although recorded, is void against subsequent purchasers, even with notice; however, it is good between the parties. Conner v. Abbott, 35 Ark. 365 (1880); Wright v. Graham, 42 Ark. 140 (1883), overruled, Sidway v. Lawson, 58 Ark. 117, 23 S.W. 648 (1893).
         </p>
         <p>
          The omission of the word “consideration” or words of similar import in the acknowledgment of a mortgage renders the record thereof no notice to third parties. Atlas Supply Co. v. McAmis, 185 Ark. 1168, 51 S.W.2d 982 (1932).
         </p>
         <p>
          An acknowledgment to a mortgage that it was “executed for the consideration and premises hereinafter set forth” sufficiently complied with this section to entitle the mortgage to be recorded. First Nat. Bank v. Meriwether Sand & Gravel Co., 188 Ark. 642, 67 S.W.2d 599 (1934).
         </p>
         <p>
          An acknowledgment, valid in the state where made, but ineffectual at the time of recordation in Arkansas because of failure to use words required by this section, was cured by Acts 1935, No. 72 and Acts 1937, No. 352. Jackson v. Hudspeth, 208 Ark. 55, 184 S.W.2d 906 (1945).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where a deed was not properly acknowledged, this deficiency was not cured by the attempt after the grantor's death to authenticate the signature; therefore, this instrument was not entitled to the weight given to a properly recorded deed. Frazier v. Frazier, 263 Ark. 768, 567 S.W.2d 629 (1978).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where the notary public who had acknowledged previous leases acknowledged renewal lease and who, upon receiving a telephone request from the lessor, testified that she knew the lessor and recognized her voice on the telephone when the lessor called to state that she had signed the lease, the notary's certificate of acknowledgment was regular on its face, and absent any finding of fraud or forgery, the telephone acknowledgment was valid. Stallings v. Poteete, 17 Ark. App. 62, 702 S.W.2d 831 (1986).
         </p>
         <p>
          Subsections (b) and (c) require that two witnesses to a signature on an instrument actually witness the signing of the instrument rather than testify as to the authenticity of the signature. Frazier v. Frazier, 263 Ark. 768, 567 S.W.2d 629 (1978).

       <p>
        An acknowledgment taken by an interested party does not authorize it to be recorded and it imparts no notice; however, such acknowledgments taken before Acts 1883, No. 69, were validated by § 6 of that act. Green v. Abraham, 43 Ark. 420 (1884) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acts 1893, No. 43, did not cure an acknowledgment which was taken by a party to the deed. Meunse v. Harper, 70 Ark. 309, 67 S.W. 869 (1902) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former curative act did not render valid a certificate of acknowledgment which the notary failed to sign although he affixed the imprint of his seal. Davis v. Hale, 114 Ark. 426, 170 S.W. 99 (1914) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        A mortgage of a homestead which was invalid because the grantors' wives did not join therein, was cured by former validating act. Sanders v. Flenniken, 172 Ark. 454, 289 S.W. 485 (1926) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The curative provisions of this section cannot supply an acknowledgment when in fact there is none. Pardo v. Creamer, 228 Ark. 746, 310 S.W.2d 218 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a mortgage only contained a jurat by a notary public which simply stated “Given under my hand and official seal this 24th day of November, 2003. [Signed by] Maria F. Looper,” the mortgage was defective as it lacked an acknowledgement; this section did not cure the defect as it does not act to supply an acknowledgment when in fact there is none (decision under prior law). In re Beene, 349 B.R. 574 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurat attached to a mortgage was not an acknowledgment and, therefore, the mortgage lien was unperfected under Arkansas law; the provisions of this section could not be used to cure the defect in the mortgage because it does not act to supply an acknowledgment when in fact there was none (decision under prior law).In re Beene, 354 B.R. 856 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
     This curative statute did not operate to cure a mortgage deed that failed to comply with the acknowledgement requirements in §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c47s16-47-106" target="_blank">16-47-106</a></cite> and<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c47s16-47-101" target="_blank">16-47-101</a></cite> because the transaction occurred after the passage of the statute. Thus, a mortgage lien was not perfected and could be avoided by a trustee under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 544(a) and 550(a).Williams v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (In re Stewart), 422 B.R. 185 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family's claim that any defects in the acknowledgement of a prenuptial agreement between the decedent and his wife could be cured was rejected as there was no acknowledgement, defective or otherwise, and thus the curative provisions of this section did not apply.Lyle Farms P'ship v. Lyle, 2016 Ark. App. 577, 507 S.W.3d 519 (2016).

     An acknowledgment valid in the state where made but ineffectual at the time of recordation in Arkansas because of failure to use words required by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c12s18-12-206" target="_self">18-12-206</a></cite> was held to have been cured by former validating acts. Jackson v. Hudspeth, 208 Ark. 55, 184 S.W.2d 906 (1945) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former acts, curing defective acknowledgments, did not interfere with vested rights. McGehee v. McKenzie, 43 Ark. 156 (1884) (decision under prior law).

       <p>
        The only showing upon which a deed can be admitted to evidence is the certificate of acknowledgment by the proper officer. Simpson v. Montgomery, 25 Ark. 365 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        The acknowledgment of the execution of a deed of conveyance, as required by this section, does not alone authorize its introduction as evidence. It must also be filed and recorded or its execution proved at the trial. Wilson v. Spring, 38 Ark. 181 (1881); Watson v. Billings, 38 Ark. 278 (1881); Dorr v. School Dist., 40 Ark. 237 (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        An unrecorded mortgage is inadmissible in evidence without proof of its execution. Gardner v. Hughes, 136 Ark. 332, 206 S.W. 678 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        A certified copy of a recorded conveyance is admissible in evidence without proof of the execution. Apel v. Kelsey, 47 Ark. 413, 2 S.W. 102 (1886); Sibly v. England, 90 Ark. 420, 119 S.W. 820 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a plaintiff in ejectment is not able to introduce an original deed in evidence, a purported copy from the record is not admissible unless certified by the recorder. Robert v. Brown, 157 Ark. 230, 247 S.W. 1058 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for forgery, it was not improper to permit the introduction of the record of certain deed, in the chain of title to the land, concerning which it was alleged that forged deed had been uttered by the defendant, without proof that the original deeds were either lost or destroyed. Temple v. State, 126 Ark. 290, 189 S.W. 855 (1916), overruled on other grounds, Nail v. State, 231 Ark. 70, 328 S.W.2d 836 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proof rests upon the person denying that he signed a deed or acknowledged it, to show the falsity of the certificate, which carries the presumption that the officer making it has certified to the truth. Polk v. Brown, 117 Ark. 321, 174 S.W. 562 (1915); Nevada County Bank v. Gee, 130 Ark. 312, 197 S.W. 680 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of disproving the authenticity of the acknowledgment of a deed before a notary public is on the moving party in order to have the recorded deed declared void for forgery. Lytton v. Johnson, 236 Ark. 277, 365 S.W.2d 461 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is competent for the maker of a deed to prove that there was no appearance before an officer to acknowledge its execution, and no acknowledgment in fact, yet if he did acknowledge it in some manner, the officer's certificate is conclusive as to the terms of the acknowledgment. Petty v. Grisard, 45 Ark. 117 (1885); Steers v. Kinsey, 68 Ark. 360, 58 S.W. 1050 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parol evidence that a deed has been executed, but not recorded, and lost, is sufficient to admit secondary evidence of its contents. Calloway v. Cossart, 45 Ark. 81 (1885); Crawford v. McDonald, 84 Ark. 415, 106 S.W. 206 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parol evidence is admissible to prove true date of an acknowledgment. Merrill v. Sypert, 65 Ark. 51, 44 S.W. 462 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        A recorded and properly acknowledged mortgage makes prima facie case thereon. Straughan v. Bennett, 153 Ark. 254, 240 S.W. 30 (1922).
       </p>

        Preambles. Acts 1957, No. 163 contained a preamble which read:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Whereas, the estate tail is a relic of medieval times and seldom desirable in view of the current necessity for credit and for transfer of title incident to the growth of communities, but nevertheless such an estate is often created without a realization of the delay and difficulty imposed on a conveyance of the land involved, which imposition is later sought to be dissolved; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “Whereas, the common law remedy of fine and common recovery for dissolution of said estates is no longer available as a method dissolving same and a substitute therefore should be provided;

       18-12-206. Manner of making acknowledgment — Proof of deed or instrument — Proof of identity of grantor or witness.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The acknowledgment of deeds and instruments of writing for the conveyance of real estate, or whereby such real estate is to be affected in law or equity, shall be by the grantor appearing in person before a court or officer having the authority by law to take the acknowledgment and stating that he or she had executed the deed or instrument for the consideration and purposes therein mentioned and set forth.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a deed or instrument referred to in subsection (a) of this section is to be proved, it shall be done by one (1) or more of the subscribing witnesses personally appearing before the proper court or officer and stating on oath that he or she saw the grantor subscribe the deed or instrument of writing or that the grantor acknowledged in his or her presence that he or she had subscribed and executed the deed or instrument for the purposes and consideration therein mentioned, and that he or she had subscribed the deed or instrument as a witness at the request of the grantor.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any grantor has not acknowledged the execution of a deed or instrument referred to in subsection (a) of this section and the subscribing witnesses are dead or cannot be had, then the deed or instrument may be proved by the evidence of the handwriting of the grantor and of at least one (1) of the subscribing witnesses. This evidence shall consist of the deposition of two (2) or more disinterested persons, swearing to each signature.

       The term “heirs of the body” has an appropriate technical meaning as words of limitation to designate heirs in succession. Myar v. Snow, 49 Ark. 125, 4 S.W. 381 (1887).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “children, the natural off-spring of her body” are synonymous with “bodily heirs” or “heirs of her body” and exclude the idea that they are synonymous with the general word “heirs.” Dempsey v. Davis, 98 Ark. 570, 136 S.W. 975 (1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Natural heirs” means “heirs of the body.” Maynard v. Henderson, 117 Ark. 24, 173 S.W. 831 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       Language “unto their heirs only forever” did not destroy technical meaning of “unto their heirs” which creates a fee simple absolute, and change the limitation to mean “unto their bodily heirs” which under this section would create a life estate in the grantee with remainder in his bodily heirs. United States v. 48.9 Acres of Land, 85 F. Supp. 133 (W.D. Ark. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “die without heirs” in devise of life estate and remainder meant the death without children of the remainderman before the termination of the life estate of the widow. In re Estate of Creekmore, 244 Ark. 1, 423 S.W.2d 548 (1968).

       Where the grantee of a fee tail estate died leaving a husband and son surviving, the remainder in fee was in the son and the husband took no interest whatsoever in the estate. Maynard v. Henderson, 117 Ark. 24, 173 S.W. 831 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire estate, except the possibility of reverter, passes from the grantor of a fee tail who cannot thereafter defeat the rights of the remaindermen in the land, and this is without regard to whether the fee is considered in abeyance during the estate of the life tenant, or still held by the original grantor for purposes only of passing to the remaindermen upon termination of the life estate. Le Sieur v. Spikes, 117 Ark. 366, 175 S.W. 413 (1915).

       Remaindermen held to take fee simple estate. Pletner v. Southern Lumber Co., 173 Ark. 277, 292 S.W. 370 (1927); Bowlin v. Vinsant, 186 Ark. 740, 55 S.W.2d 927 (1933); Cox v. Danehower, 211 Ark. 696, 202 S.W.2d 200 (1947).

       An estate to the grantee and bodily heirs did not vest in remainder in anyone during the life of the grantee holding under the life estate, but vested in the surviving children and their issue at the death of the life tenant. Horsley v. Hilburn, 44 Ark. 458 (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       The grantee of a fee tail could not, by her conveyance before the birth of her children, convey more than an estate terminable upon her death, the remainder in fee immediately vesting in her children surviving at that time and their issue, and right of action will not accrue until death of the life tenant. Le Sieur v. Spikes, 117 Ark. 366, 175 S.W. 413 (1915).

      <p>
       An estate to the grantee and bodily heirs vests the remainder in the children living at the time of the conveyance subject to opening up to let in other children; and upon a showing that the life tenant is past the age of giving birth to a child, the remaindermen may join with the life tenant in giving merchantable title.

       A husband had a right to contract with his wife to pay her a portion of the proceeds of the sale of real estate to induce her to relinquish her right to dower. Le Croy v. Cook, 211 Ark. 966, 204 S.W.2d 173 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife executed a quitclaim deed and an agreed order conveying her interest in the marital home to her ex-husband, but no such release of rights was executed by the homeowner; therefore, because homeowner did not join in the deed with his wife when she conveyed her interest in the property to her ex-husband, the statutory requirements of this section were not satisfied.

       The 1919 amendment was not a curative statute and did not operate to validate conveyances irregular prior to its enactment. Fulk v. Robinson, 140 Ark. 212, 215 S.W. 674 (1919).

       Acknowledgment of deed, without joining in the deed, is not sufficient. Witter v. Biscoe, 13 Ark. 422 (1853) (decision prior to 1919 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       A married woman could not release dower in favor of her husband; she could only release it by joining with the husband in a deed to a third person. Countz v. Markling, 30 Ark. 17 (1875); Pillow v. Wade, 31 Ark. 678 (1877) (preceding decisions prior to 1919 amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a husband's deed is followed by a paragraph relinquishing dower, and then follow the signatures of both husband and wife, this is such joining in the deed as is required for the relinquishment of dower. Meyer v. Gossett, 38 Ark. 377 (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife may relinquish her dower by joining in her husband's deed and acknowledging it without any clause of relinquishment in the deed. Dutton v. Stuart, 41 Ark. 101 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a married woman joins her husband in the execution of a deed in which she has no estate except a contingent right of dower, and the deed contains no clause relinquishing dower, her right to dower is barred thereby, if the deed is properly acknowledged. Johnson v. Parker, 51 Ark. 419, 11 S.W. 681 (1889).

       A conveyance invalid under this section is not cured by subsequent abandonment, and the homestead becomes liable to attachment for the homesteader's debts which relate back to the date of the lien of the writ, and where antedating the deed, give a lien prior to any title acquired under it. Pipkin v. Williams, 57 Ark. 242, 21 S.W. 433 (1893); Newman v. Jacobson, 108 Ark. 297, 158 S.W. 134 (1913).

      </p>
      <p>
       While this section is a limitation upon the right of a husband to convey his homestead, it does not restrict his right of abandonment; and when he exercises his right of abandonment of the homestead, it is not required that the wife join in conveyance of the abandoned homestead. Farmers' Sav. Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Jones, 68 Ark. 76, 56 S.W. 1062 (1900); Stewart v. Pritchard, 101 Ark. 101, 141 S.W. 505 (1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of abandonment is restricted to abandonment and selection of another or none, and if a husband deserts his family and abandons the homestead without his family joining in the abandonment, he cannot thereafter convey the homestead without the wife joining. Montgomery v. Dane, 81 Ark. 154, 98 S.W. 715 (1906).

       An absolute conveyance by the husband of the homestead with a reservation in himself of a life estate without the wife joining is in detriment of the wife's interest and void. Park v. Park, 71 Ark. 283, 72 S.W. 993 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conveyance of the homestead without the wife joining is void even though she lives in another state. Mason v. Dierks Lumber & Coal Co., 94 Ark. 107, 125 S.W. 656 (1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband's assignment of his paid-up contract of purchase of homestead as security for a loan, the wife failing to join therein, was void. Watson v. Poindexter, 176 Ark. 1065, 5 S.W.2d 299 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Easement for right-of-way over homestead, not acknowledged by the wife, was void. Autrey v. Lake, 195 Ark. 243, 112 S.W.2d 434 (1938); Arkansas State Hwy. Comm'n v. Marlar, 247 Ark. 710, 447 S.W.2d 329 (1969).

      <p>
       It does not matter whether property is owned by husband or wife, where property constitutes homestead, contract is void when wife does not sign. Bowden v. Wilson, 214 Ark. 828, 218 S.W.2d 374 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The nonjoinder of a spouse in the anticipated conveyance of real estate is not such a defect in the title as would prevent real estate broker from recovering commission after he secured buyer. Portis v. Thrash, 216 Ark. 946, 229 S.W.2d 127 (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife's failure to join in the contract of sale of an urban homestead renders it absolutely void with respect to the homestead of at least the constitutional minimum of a quarter of an acre. Rowe v. Gose, 240 Ark. 722, 401 S.W.2d 745 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where wife did not join in execution of lease by husband to his mother of property including the homestead, and land involved was not within an incorporated town or city, the entire tract was the homestead, regardless of value, and the lease was void. George v. George, 267 Ark. 823, 591 S.W.2d 655 (Ct. App. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where husband and wife each executed separate quitclaim deeds conveying same property to wife's parents, deeds were void because spouse did not join in either deed, and subsequent deed of correction signed by both parties did not validate the void deeds and property did not actually convey until date on which deed of correction was executed.

      </h4>
      <p>
       If the deed shows an intent on the part of the wife to join with her husband in the conveyance of the homestead, there is compliance with this section. Gantt v. Hildreth, 90 Ark. 113, 118 S.W. 255 (1909); A.R. Bowdre & Co. v. Pitts, 94 Ark. 613, 128 S.W. 57 (1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where mortgage specifically provided for the release of former wife's homestead interests but did not specifically mention husband's homestead interests, and because a conveyance may include unspecified homestead interests if the conveyance is intended to transfer all interests in the property, the document was conclusive on the question of intent to convey homestead interests, and the plaintiff husband and his former wife waived their homestead interests in real property. In re Holder, 52 B.R. 37 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1985).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Form of compliance is immaterial so long as the two substantive acts (joinder in execution and acknowledgment) prescribed as prerequisites appear in the deed, and unless they do appear, the deed is void. Pipkin v. Williams, 57 Ark. 242, 21 S.W. 433 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the wife's name did not appear in the body of the deed but was subscribed in the acknowledgment, there was sufficient compliance with this section. Ward v. Stark Bros., 91 Ark. 268, 121 S.W. 382 (1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       To execute a valid deed of trust on homestead property, the wife must join in and acknowledge that she has executed the deed. Davis v. Hale, 114 Ark. 426, 170 S.W. 99 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the wife actually joins in executing the deed, and then acknowledges its execution before an officer authorized to certify acknowledgments, she has done all the substantive acts required; and, as this section prescribes no form or manner of doing them, there cannot be noncompliance with its provisions for matter of form merely; whenever a substantial compliance appears, this section is satisfied and the deed will be valid. Mayfield v. Sehon, 205 Ark. 1142, 172 S.W.2d 914 (1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not essential to the validity of a deed of trust on the homestead that the name of the wife appear in the granting clause, nor that the word “homestead” be used. Mayfield v. Sehon, 205 Ark. 1142, 172 S.W.2d 914 (1943).

      <p>
       A release of dower and nothing more, in a clause following the granting clause, is not a joinder with the grantor in conveyance of the homestead. Pipkin v. Williams, 57 Ark. 242, 21 S.W. 433 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       Joinder in acknowledgment of a deed is not sufficient compliance if the acknowledgment, insofar as the wife is concerned, is an acknowledgment merely of a relinquishment of dower. Bank of Harrison v. Gibson, 60 Ark. 269, 30 S.W. 39 (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the wife's name did not appear in the granting clause but was subscribed with the other grantors in the acknowledgment, and the deed contained no clause as to the relinquishment of dower, there was sufficient compliance with this section. Sledge & Norfleet Co. v. Craig, 87 Ark. 371, 112 S.W. 892 (1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the acknowledgment recited that the wife relinquished both dower and homestead but the body of the instrument contained a clause that she relinquished dower but it was not perfectly evident that she joined in its execution, it was held that there was a relinquishment of dower only and the conveyance was void. Shurn v. Wilkinson, 131 Ark. 167, 198 S.W. 279 (1917).

       Where wife did not protest renewal of mortgage without her signature, and did not present evidence showing that she had no knowledge of renewal of mortgage or that she had not shared in the benefits of the proceeds of the original loan, wife was estopped from applying this section. In re Beard, 108 B.R. 212 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an instrument affecting the homestead of a married person is generally invalid unless the person's spouse joins in the instrument, a spouse may be estopped to deny the validity of an instrument in which he or she did not join. Smith v. Parker, 67 Ark. App. 221, 998 S.W.2d 1 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The appellants were estopped from arguing that a lease was void for want of the signature of the wife of the original lessor where the wife was aware of the lease, accepted the monetary benefits of the lease, and expressed no objection that her name was not on the lease. Smith v. Parker, 67 Ark. App. 221, 998 S.W.2d 1 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly found that the protections of this section were not available to ex-wife because she was aware of the lien on the property; she knew there was a loan that obligated her to pay a debt, she behaved as though she understood that she was so obligated, and even after she claimed she learned about the alleged forgeries of her name to the documents, she agreed to take responsibility for any debt on the property in exchange for sole ownership of it in the divorce.Kline v. PHH Mortg. Corp., 2019 Ark. App. 462, 587 S.W.3d 262 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no evidence to support a finding that ex-wife acknowledged the mortgage within the meaning of this section but she did not demonstrate reversible error because the circuit court did not make a finding of compliance with this section but instead found estoppel.Kline v. PHH Mortg. Corp., 2019 Ark. App. 462, 587 S.W.3d 262 (2019).

       An acknowledgment valid to convey the wife's dower will be sufficient to relinquish homestead rights even though the wife was induced to execute it by misrepresentations that the mortgage did not cover the homestead. Hill v. Yarborough, 62 Ark. 320, 35 S.W. 433 (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a husband procured his wife to join in a deed conveying their homestead by false pretenses and the homestead was thereafter reconveyed to him for life with remainder to his children, the conveyance was a fraud upon the wife's right to dower and homestead. Colegrove v. Colegrove, 89 Ark. 182, 116 S.W. 190 (1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       No fraud or undue influence actually exercised over the wife by the husband can vitiate the conveyance if the grantee be no party to the improper influence and has no knowledge of it. Harper v. McGoogan, 107 Ark. 10, 154 S.W. 187 (1913).

       Where a quitclaim instrument expressly recognized the wife's homestead and reserved that right to her, it was not an “instrument affecting the homestead” within the prohibition of this section. Conser v. Biddy, 274 Ark. 367, 625 S.W.2d 457 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Homestead exemption could extend to a revocable trust where the person claiming the exemption was the trustee and beneficiary, and maintained the property as the person's principal place of business, because this section invalidated any conveyance affecting entitlement to a homestead exemption in which a spouse did not join in the execution.Fitton v.

      By joining with his or her spouse in the execution of power of attorney, or by separate instrument, a married person may appoint an agent or attorney in fact and authorize him or her, for and in the person's name and stead, to relinquish all rights and possibility of dower, curtesy, and homestead to a spouse's grantee, lessee, or mortgagee in any lands, oil, gas, mineral, or timber and to execute for the person such relinquishment of dower, curtesy, and homestead in any oil and gas lease or assignment thereof, mineral deed, timber deed, royalty contract, mortgage, or contract for the sale of any land, timber, or minerals, or any interest therein, owned by a spouse and conveyed by the spouse to the grantee.

      (1)The act of an agent or attorney in fact, when authorized by properly executed and recorded power of attorney, in so relinquishing dower, curtesy, and homestead of a married person by joining in any deed, lease, conveyance of minerals, royalty contract, or other contract for the sale of any lands or lease of any lands for developing its minerals, or any interest therein, or the assignment of any oil and gas lease or interest therein shall be as effectual and binding as if the instrument or instruments had been executed in the first instance by the married person.
     </p>

       Although creditor banks argued that their lis pendens filings and quitclaim deeds given to debtor by her relatives related back to prior transfers and operated to perfect their interests in the properties prior to the preference period, because the bankruptcy court found that the lis pendens filings and quitclaim deeds were avoidable preferences under 11 U.S.C.S. § 547(b), the doctrine of after-acquired title was not effective to secure the banks' interests, if any, in the properties; moreover, the facts did not involve the simple defective acknowledgment of a mortgage, but rather, the entities that mortgaged these properties to the banks in fact had no legal interest in the properties themselves.

       If, between the date of the conveyance of real estate by a grantor who has no title or an imperfect title and the subsequent acquisition of perfect title, a judgment is rendered against the grantor, the title of the grantee is prior to the lien of the judgment.

      <p>
       One who, after executing a mortgage on a tract of land owned by another, acquired the interest of a mortgagee from the true owner, did not acquire such an interest in the land as would pass under this section as its value was dependent upon the debt and became worthless when the debt was paid.

      <p>
       Where one, intending to purchase certain lands, executes a mortgage to secure money with which to pay for it, but which money is not furnished, he may later mortgage the same land to another for the same purpose who, on furnishing the money, secures a lien on the land superior to the first mortgage, even though the first mortgage was recorded. Faulkner County Bank & Trust Co. v. Vail, 173 Ark. 406, 293 S.W. 40 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a violation of the spirit of this section to permit mortgagor to acquire title from a prior mortgagee who had bought the land after sale under such mortgage, and then defeat the payment or hold that the land was not subject to the lien of the second mortgage. Stone v. Morris, 177 Ark. 745, 7 S.W.2d 796 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a husband and wife gave a bank a mortgage which was recorded, then construction began on a house on that lot, and finally the couple recorded their own deed on the land, the mortgage had priority over the materialmen's liens since title was in another at the time the materialmen's liens attached and no such lien could exist absent a valid contract with the landowner at the time of delivery, whereas title could relate back for the purposes of the mortgage.

       Where widow executed warranty deed as her son's guardian conveying mineral rights in which she had only a life estate, title which she had attempted to convey and warrant passed to her grantee and his successors in interest when she acquired her son's interest by quitclaim deed after he became of age. Sheppard v. Zeppa, 199 Ark. 1, 133 S.W.2d 860 (1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where owner of mortgaged land executed mineral deeds, each containing a covenant of general warranty, and thereafter the mortgage was foreclosed in suit which cut off rights of junior title claimants, and two years thereafter such owner reacquired the property, he was estopped from disputing the validity of the mineral conveyances which he executed. Hayes v. Coats, 218 Ark. 678, 238 S.W.2d 935 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where husband and wife executed deeds to mineral interests in mortgaged property, although wife had only an inchoate interest therein, and later after death of husband, the mortgage was foreclosed in proceedings in which the mineral rights owners were not made parties, and the purchaser at the foreclosure sale conveyed an interest in the property to the wife, the title so acquired by the wife, as to the mineral interests passed to the purchasers under the previous mineral deeds. Robertson v. Griffin, 227 Ark. 969, 302 S.W.2d 773 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not convey plaintiffs the mineral rights they alleged they obtained from defendant two in 2003, which had been conveyed to defendant two by defendant one in 1997, when the rights were conveyed to defendant one in 2004 as the deeds had been reformed deeds and related back to their original execution, and there was no mineral title to pass under this section.Mauldin v. Snowden, 2011 Ark. App. 630, 386 S.W.3d 560 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving the mineral rights to 220 acres of property, reformation of a warranty deed for the surface estate was proper based on mutual mistake because the deed failed to properly include a reservation of the mineral interest. There was no need to reform all of the deeds and conveyances subsequent to the conveyance at issue because, once that deed was reformed, there was no evidence that any of the deeds were not as intended by the parties to those deeds, and, because of the reformation, there were no mineral interests to pass under the after-acquired title statute.Longing Family Revocable Trust v. Snowden, 2013 Ark. App. 81, 426 S.W.3d 488 (2013).

      <p>
       Ruling in favor of a corporation that the decedent's wife did not hold title to the land or mineral rights at issue was proper because she possessed only a dower interest under §28-11-301 at the time of the 1986 deed and the after-acquired title doctrine barred her from asserting a claim to the property. At most, she had only a dower interest in the oil, gas, and mineral rights reserved by her husband in the 1986 deed and even if the deed had specifically limited her conveyance to her actual interest at the time, that interest was inchoate when the deed was executed.Evans v.

      </p>
      <p>
       A quitclaim deed, for a substantial consideration, purporting to convey all interest in the land “present or prospective” of a contingent remainderman, upon the death of the life tenant became fully effective to transfer title. Bradley Lumber Co. v. Burbridge, 213 Ark. 165, 210 S.W.2d 284 (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where husband and wife were in possession of real estate by a deed with a faulty description as tenants by entirety and the husband deeded his interest to wife, and later acquired a quitclaim deed in his name to correct the description, the after-acquired title immediately vested title in wife.

       This section does not prohibit a joint tenancy; it merely provides for a construction against joint tenancy if the intention to create it is not clear. Ferrell v. Holland, 205 Ark. 523, 169 S.W.2d 643 (1943); Mitchell v. Mitchell, 263 Ark. 365, 565 S.W.2d 29 (1978).

       Where a conveyance is to a husband and wife, they take an estate of entirety, and survivorship still obtains. Robinson v. Eagle, 29 Ark. 202 (1874); Branch v. Polk, 61 Ark. 388, 33 S.W. 424 (1895); Simpson v. Biffle, 63 Ark. 289, 38 S.W. 345 (1896); Davies v. Johnson, 124 Ark. 390, 187 S.W. 323 (1916).

       Although defendant and deceased had been bigamously married, a deed which identified them as “husband and wife” and described their interest as that of “tenants by entirety” succeeded in meeting the requirements of this section for a joint tenancy. Wood v. Wood, 264 Ark. 304, 571 S.W.2d 84 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deeds to man and wife created no right of survivorship, which would have existed in a tenancy by the entirety, where the persons named as grantees were not, in fact, married, and no words otherwise expressed a right of survivorship. Smith v. Stewart, 268 Ark. 766, 596 S.W.2d 346, aff'd, 269 Ark. 363, 601 S.W.2d 837 (1980).

       Where the relevant language of an instrument granting title clearly separated the parties into four groups, including two married couples and then stated that the grantees took as tenants in common, each of the four groups had an undivided one-fourth interest in the land conveyed, but the married couples held their interests by the entirety; this section could only control, resulting in tenancies in common, if the grantor had not granted the two married couples their interest by the entirety.

       18-12-608. Beneficiary deeds — Terms — Recording required.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      (1)(A)A beneficiary deed is a deed without current tangible consideration that conveys upon the death of the owner an ownership interest in real property other than a leasehold or lien interest to a grantee designated by the owner and that expressly states that the deed is not to take effect until the death of the owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      (i)A beneficiary deed transfers the interest to the designated grantee effective upon the death of the owner, subject to:
     </p>
     <p>
      All conveyances, assignments, contracts, leases, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security pledges, oil, gas, or mineral leases, and other encumbrances made by the owner or to which the real property was subject at the time of the owner's death, whether or not the conveyance or encumbrance was created before or after the execution of the beneficiary deed; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   A claim for reimbursement of federal or state benefits by the Department of Human Services from the estate of the grantor or the interest acquired by a grantee of the beneficiary deed under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.20.html#t20c76s20-76-436" target="_blank">20-76-436</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      No legal or equitable interest shall vest in the grantee until the death of the owner prior to revocation of the beneficiary deed.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)The owner may designate multiple grantees under a beneficiary deed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Multiple grantees may be joint tenants with right of survivorship, tenants in common, holders of a tenancy by the entirety, or any other tenancy that is otherwise valid under the laws of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)The owner may designate one (1) or more successor grantees, including one (1) or more unnamed heirs of the original grantee or grantees, under a beneficiary deed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The condition upon which the interest of a successor grantee vests, such as the failure of the original grantee to survive the grantor, shall be included in the beneficiary deed.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)If real property is owned as a tenancy by the entirety or as a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship, a beneficiary deed that conveys an interest in the real property to a grantee designated by all of the then surviving owners and that expressly states the beneficiary deed is not to take effect until the death of the last surviving owner transfers the interest to the designated grantee effective upon the death of the last surviving owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)If a beneficiary deed is executed by fewer than all of the owners of real property owned as a tenancy by the entirety or as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the beneficiary deed is valid if the last surviving owner is a person who executed the beneficiary deed.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the last surviving owner did not execute the beneficiary deed, the beneficiary deed is invalid.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)A beneficiary deed is valid only if the beneficiary deed is recorded before the death of the owner or the last surviving owner as provided by law in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      A beneficiary deed may be used to transfer an interest in real property to a trustee of a trust estate even if the trust is revocable and may include one (1) or more unnamed successor trustees as successor grantees.

     While timeshare owners do not receive an individual tax bill, the property itself is assessed real property taxes by the assessor and improvement-district assessments, which are then paid by the timeshare owners through the owners association; thus, a timeshare owner owns property subject to taxation and thereby satisfies the definition of a “property owner” entitled to individual notice of commissioner elections under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.14.html#t14c92s14-92-240ol1c" target="_blank">14-92-240(c)</a></cite>, and each timeshare owner is entitled to one vote for each commissioner position to be filled.Roberts v.

       <p>
        Same measure of damages was used whether the proceeding was an eminent domain action filed by the utility or an inverse condemnation action filed by the landowner; the landowners' remedy for the utility's taking of their property was governed exclusively by the inverse condemnation statute, which permitted them to recover only the value of the portion of the land taken plus any damage to remaining property, it did not permit them to recover the replacement value of their trees. DeBoer v. Entergy Ark. Inc., 82 Ark. App. 400, 109 S.W.3d 142 (2003).

       </p>
       <p>
        Directed verdict for a utility company was proper under subsection (b) of this section as: (1) the property owners'remedy on an inverse condemnation claim was the value of the portion of the land taken plus any damage to the remaining property; (2) the owners did not submit any evidence as to the damage to the remainder of their property, and (3) opinion evidence of the value of the entire parcel at the time of the taking was not supported by proof that the listing price was reasonable.Pope v.

        Circuit court erred in dismissing the property owners'complaint against an electric company and in finding that the Arkansas Public Service Commission had primary jurisdiction of the case; there was no dispute that the company had a right to use its own existing lines to transmit broadband services, but the owners'issue was with the company's entry onto their land to install completely new lines for broadband services without just compensation or an assessment of damages for the increased interference. The circuit court had exclusive, original jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute involving private-property rights and damages for inverse condemnation and increased interference.Stanley v.

Emergency clause provided: “The General Assembly hereby finds, declares and determines that existing laws of eminent domain do not furnish sufficient authority for condemnation of lands for municipal waterworks systems; that the furnishing of an adequate supply of water to its inhabitants by a municipality is an absolute necessity; that there is municipal waterworks construction underway in this State at the present time which requires immediately the additional authority granted by this Act, without which construction of waterworks facilities will be seriously hampered and delayed to the detriment of the citizens of this State and to the detriment of the public health and general welfare, and that by reason of said facts an emergency is declared to exist and this Act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety and welfare, shall take effect from and after its passage and approval.”

      In addition, for electric transmission systems and electric distribution systems, it shall be no objection to the exercise of power that the property to be condemned is located outside the corporate limits of the municipal corporation or in a county other than the one wherein the municipal corporation is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      A municipal corporation shall have the power of eminent domain for its electric transmission system and electric distribution system, outside of its corporate limits without annexation of such territory, regardless of whether the territory has been allocated to an electric public utility or electric cooperative corporation, pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity or other authority from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, as long as the electric transmission system or electric distribution system being constructed by the municipal corporation is only for the purpose of serving customers of the municipal corporation and not for the purpose of serving electric public utility customers or electric cooperative customers at retail inside the territory allocated to an electric public utility or electric cooperative corporation pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity or other authority from the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)Before a municipal corporation exercises the power of eminent domain under this section, the municipal corporation shall provide written notice to any electric public utility or electric cooperative corporation that has received a certificate of convenience and necessity or other authority from the commission to serve retail customers in any area in which the power of eminent domain is to be exercised.
     </p>
     <p>
      The power of a municipality to condemn a cemetery for those purposes shall extend to all cemeteries except those owned by the United States of America, the State of Arkansas, a county of the State of Arkansas, or a municipality of the State of Arkansas.

     <p>
      The water pipelines, electric transmission facilities, or electric distribution facilities may be constructed and maintained across and under lands and waters of the state, but the ordinary use of the lands and waters shall not be unduly obstructed thereby.

     <p>
      (A)The water pipelines, electric transmission facilities, or electric distribution facilities may be constructed and maintained under, across, and along public highways, roads, streets, and alleys, but the ordinary use of the public highways, roads, streets, and alleys shall not be unduly obstructed thereby.

     Where city claimed title to island property under a 1975 condemnation decree that claimants contended their predecessors in title had no notice of, the trial court properly found that the claimants'sole remedy was an inverse condemnation action under this section and that the applicable seven-year statute of limitations under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c61s18-61-101" target="_self">18-61-101</a></cite> had expired.

       18-15-408. Cemeteries and graves.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      (1)An operating authority of a municipal waterworks system shall file a notice of intent to condemn in the circuit court of the county where a cemetery or graves are situated if the operating authority determines that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Land occupied by the cemetery or by the graves will be flooded by an impounding lake;
     </p>
     <p>
      The water level of the lake will affect the graves underground;
     </p>
     <p>
      The lake may be contaminated by the graves; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The lands will be useful for waterworks purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice of intent to condemn shall set out the:
     </p>
     <p>
      Commonly known name of the cemetery, if any;
     </p>
     <p>
      Descriptions of the quarter sections of land upon which the cemetery or graves are situated;
     </p>
     <p>
      Description of a proposed new location of the cemetery or graves; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Name of the owner of the existing cemetery, if known.
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice shall take the place of the application to condemn which would be otherwise required under this subchapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Service of process upon the owner, if known, shall be as specified in this subchapter. Service upon all other interested parties shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice shall be published one (1) time a week for four (4) consecutive weeks in some newspaper having a general circulation throughout the state in order to give the widest publicity to the municipality's intention;
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, a printed copy of the notice shall be posted in three (3) conspicuous public places in the cemetery or immediately surrounding the graves;
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice shall be posted within three (3) days of filing the notice with the court; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality shall, by affidavit filed with the court, give proof of posting of the notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)Before filing the notice with the court, the municipality shall be required to select a tract of land at least equal in size to the cemetery to be condemned and shall describe the tract in the notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality shall be required to file with its notice a statement from the Department of Health approving the proposed new location.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the notice of intent has been published for four (4) weeks, as required by this section, the circuit court sitting without a jury shall determine if the proposed new location is suitable, and, if the court so finds, it shall enter an order to that effect. The owner of the cemetery or of the lands where the existing cemetery is located and the next of kin of any person buried in the cemetery or in the graves shall be entitled to appear in the proceeding and object to the proposed location and suggest other locations.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Thereafter, the municipality may file an application under the provisions of this subchapter for condemnation of the site so approved by the court, within a radius of four (4) miles of the existing cemetery.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is declared that the acquisition of the site shall be for public purposes and that the site may be condemned by the operating authority of a municipal waterworks system.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   (1)After judgment has been entered vesting title to the new site in the applicant, as set out in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c15s18-15-404" target="_self">18-15-404</a></cite>, the court shall enter an order in the proceedings mentioned in subsection (a) of this section, vesting title to the new cemetery site in the persons owning the lands of the cemetery or graves to be relocated and vesting title in the municipality to the lands where the old cemetery or graves are located.
     </p>
     <p>
      The order vesting title to the new cemetery site in the owners of the old cemetery or grave sites shall be the compensation and damages to which the owners of the old sites are entitled.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Thereafter, the municipality, at its own expense, shall be required to remove all bodies, tombstones, and markers from the site of the original graves and to reinter the bodies in the new site, properly resetting tombstones and markers, if any, at the new site.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court may require the municipality to deposit with the clerk of the court a sum found by the court to be sufficient to ensure the performance of the obligation by the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, any surviving spouse or next of kin of a person whose grave is to be relocated may demand, prior to removal from the old grave site, that the municipality pay the expense of removing the body of the decedent to a cemetery selected by the surviving spouse or next of kin, the municipality paying the reasonable cost of the removal and reinterment.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the old cemetery site was fenced, the municipality shall be required to install a fence of similar type around the new cemetery site and shall be required to construct within the cemetery such hard-surfaced roads as may be necessary to give access to grave sites. The roads shall be of at least equal quality with the roads in the original cemetery site.

       18-15-409. Controversy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      (1)When the determination of questions in controversy in the eminent domain proceedings authorized in this subchapter is, in the opinion of the operating authority of the municipal waterworks, likely to retard the progress of the project, the municipality shall so state in its application or in a separate pleading.
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality shall also designate a sum which, in its opinion, is the reasonable value of the property to be taken and shall deposit that sum in the registry of the court for the purpose of making compensation and paying any damages which may be assessed against the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court shall thereupon immediately enter an order giving the municipality possession of the property and may enforce the order, if necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      A copy of the order of possession shall be served upon any person of adult age found residing upon the premises, but only one (1) person need be served.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, at any time after the order is entered, any defendant may file a motion for a hearing on the amount of the deposit, giving notice of the motion to the applicant, and at the hearing the court may affirm the amount of the original deposit or may order it increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      No motion for hearing shall delay the applicant's right to possession.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Any person named as a defendant in the action and claiming to be an owner of the property being condemned shall be entitled to apply to the court for a withdrawal of all or a part of the funds so deposited upon giving reasonable notice of his or her motion to withdraw funds to the applicant. The defendant shall also notify all other defendants whose addresses are known of his motion.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)Before entering an order permitting a withdrawal of any portion of the deposit, the court shall determine the ownership of the property to be condemned, and no defendant shall be permitted to withdraw any greater portion of the deposit than is equal to his or her interest in the property to be condemned.
     </p>
     <p>
      In no event shall the aggregate amount of the withdrawal for all defendants be greater than the amount originally deposited by the municipality on its own motion.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any defendant claims that the amount withdrawn by any other defendant was wrongful or was excessive, the dispute shall be solely between the defendants.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any judgment against the municipality, the municipality shall receive full credit against all defendants for the amount deposited with the clerk or paid to the clerk after judgment.

        Where the public utility had ample access to its right-of-way without the necessity of crossing the lands of the landowner since there were numerous existing public roads on the landowner's lands which crossed the right-of-way, it had to specifically describe, condemn, and pay just compensation for any alternate routes of reasonable access.

        Where the public utility sought the right to cut, trim, or remove “danger trees” growing outside of its right-of-way that could potentially endanger its transmission line, and the landowner would be deprived of its customary use and practice of tree farming of the property on which the “danger trees” would be cut since it would be unable to grow trees in the area outside the right-of-way, the public utility had to specifically describe, condemn, and pay just compensation for the right to cut, trim, or remove trees that could potentially endanger the transmission line.

        The question of whether the condemnation of a right-of-way for a transmission line is necessary must be left largely to the discretion of the condemnor, and the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed unless it clearly appears that the discretion has been abused and the action is arbitrary and causing unnecessary damage to the property owners.

       The test for the value of condemned property was not the value of the land to the power company but the loss caused to the property owner by virtue of the condemnation. Therefore, it was error to instruct jury that if the property were well adapted for the use to which it was being taken and the necessity for that use so imminent as to add something to its value in the minds of the power company, that element could be considered in estimating market value.

        Circuit court erred in dismissing the property owners'complaint against an electric company and in finding that the Arkansas Public Service Commission had primary jurisdiction of the case; there was no dispute that the company had a right to use its own existing lines to transmit broadband services, but the owners'issue was with the company's entry onto their land to install completely new lines for broadband services without just compensation or an assessment of damages for the increased interference. The circuit court had exclusive, original jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute involving private-property rights and damages for inverse condemnation and increased interference.Stanley v. Ozarks Elec. Coop. Corp., 2019 Ark. App. 560, 591 S.W.3d 322 (2019).

        Award of fees as sanctions was reversed because oral representations could not be the basis for sanctions under Ark. R. Civ. P. 11; further, in light of the uncertainty in the statutes, the trial court erred in finding that subsection (b) of this section was inapplicable. City of Fort Smith v.

        Mortgagees, who were awarded compensation by a jury after eminent domain proceedings were instituted by a city, were not entitled to attorney’s fees because the mortgagees had no right of possession in the condemned land.City of Fort Smith v. Carter, 372 Ark. 93, 270 S.W.3d 822 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a condemnation action, the property owners incurred expenses in successfully defending the appeal. To place them in the same position they were in prior to the taking by the water district, the appellate court granted their request for attorney's fees and costs that were incurred during their defending of the appeal pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.Beaver Water Dist. v.

       <p>
        Although drainage was part of the purpose of a city's condemnation, improvement of drainage ancillary to improvement of a public road did not involve the city's exercise of eminent domain relating to waterworks. Therefore, subsection (b) of this section did not apply, and the landowner was not entitled to attorney's fees.Lois Marie Combs Revocable Trust v. City of Russellville, 2011 Ark. 186 (2011).

       <p>
        In an eminent domain proceeding brought by a municipal water and sewage commission for two utility easements, the trial court properly denied the landowner's motion for attorney's fees under subsection (b) of this section because the taking was limited to sewer lines and thus this section was inapplicable. The language of the easement, “water transmission line(s) and/or sewer collection lines”, was ambiguous, and extrinsic evidence demonstrated that the commission was exercising its eminent domain powers exclusively for the construction of sewer lines, and not water lines.Blanchard v. City of Springdale, 2019 Ark. App. 522, 588 S.W.3d 807 (2019).

          In condemnation cases, the landowner is limited to five items of damage: (1) the fair market value of the land appropriated; (2) damage which the construction of the levee will cause by the obstruction of natural drainage; (3) inconvenience of passing over the levee, ditch, drain or canal; (4) the value of crop and houses on the right-of-way injured or destroyed; (5) any easement or flowage right or increased use or servitude.

          In condemnation cases, the landowner is entitled to recover damages for all property taken or damaged; within such purview is part of the land which will be on one side of the river and part on the other, and the tract which will be practically isolated because of the road when constructed.

      The appraisers shall hold their offices for the term of one (1) year and until their successors are duly appointed and qualified. In the event of a vacancy in the office or the removal by an appraiser from the county for which he or she was appointed, then it shall be the duty of the circuit judge, as soon as notified of the vacancy, to fill the unexpired term of the office by appointment.

      The oath shall be recorded in the book provided for the record of the appointment of the appraisers and shall authorize the appraisers severally to enter upon the discharge of their respective duties.

      The cash market value of the lands appropriated or intended to be appropriated for either levee, drain, ditch, or canal purposes;
     </p>
     <p>

      The value of crops and houses on the right-of-way, or the cost of moving the houses.

        A railway may acquire a right-of-way by adverse possession. Memphis & Little Rock R.R. v. Organ, 67 Ark. 84, 55 S.W. 952 (1899).

       <p>
        A life tenant and the remainderman are both entitled to recover for injuries to their particular estate. Bentonville R.R. v. Baker, 45 Ark. 252 (1885).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a railway company instituted a proceeding against the owner to condemn a right-of-way through land, the defendant's right to recover damages for the taking of the land is not affected by his sale of the land during the pendency of the suit. Little Rock & Fort Smith Ry. v. Allister, 68 Ark. 600, 60 S.W. 953 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure of a landowner's compensation is the market value of the land at the time of the taking, for all purposes including its availability for any use to which it is plainly adapted as well as the most valuable purpose for which it can be used. Fort Smith & Van Buren Dist. v. Scott, 103 Ark. 405, 147 S.W. 440 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        The compensation of the owner of land is to be estimated by references to any uses for which the property is adapted, having regard for the existing business or wants of the community or such as may reasonably be expected in the immediate future.

       </p>
       <p>
        Railroad was obligated to pay just compensation based upon the difference in fair market value before and after the taking and it could not dismiss its eminent domain proceeding after order of entry and completion of work but before trial, and restrict its liability only to the damages caused by its occupancy of land. Thompson v. Thompson, 253 Ark. 343, 485 S.W.2d 725 (1972).
       </p>

        It is no defense that the company could have used other lands including its own property. Cloth v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. Ry., 97 Ark. 86, 132 S.W. 1005 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is merely a venue statute, and thus a domesticated foreign corporation exercising its power of eminent domain in federal district court is not required to comply with it. Missouri Pac. R.R. v. 55 Acres of Land, 947 F. Supp. 1301 (E.D. Ark. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        A grant of a right-of-way gives no license to overflow the grantor's land by the unskillful construction of a levee on the right-of-way. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Morris, 35 Ark. 622 (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to condemn may be exercised when necessary and hence is not exhausted by one exercise. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Petty, 57 Ark. 359, 21 S.W. 884 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        A railway company acquiring for right-of-way land in which ditch has been made for drainage has no right to obstruct ditch. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Anderson, 62 Ark. 360, 35 S.W. 791 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no right to condemn land for depot purposes which another company has already condemned for that purpose. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Memphis, Dallas & Gulf R.R., 102 Ark. 492, 143 S.W. 107 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        A local zoning ordinance cannot interfere with the legislature's conferral of the power of condemnation to a private entity. Missouri Pac. R.R. v. 55 Acres of Land, 947 F. Supp. 1301 (E.D. Ark. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        These proceedings are to ascertain the compensation to be paid the landowner for the land taken; no provision is made for an issue upon the right to condemn. Niemeyer & Darragh v. Little Rock Junction Ry., 43 Ark. 111 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        The object of the proceeding is to determine the amount of damage for which the railroad company is liable. Mountain Park Term. Ry. v. Field, 76 Ark. 239, 88 S.W. 897 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding by a railroad company to condemn property for its right-of-way, the landowner may prove any fact concerning the property which he would naturally be supposed to adduce if he were attempting to sell it to a private individual. Stuttgart & Rice Belt R.R. v. Kocourek, 101 Ark. 47, 141 S.W. 511 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        The company alone can put the statutory remedy into operation, and if they neglect to do so, one who is injured by the construction of the railroad has his remedy by action against the company for the injury sustained. Bentonville R.R. v. Baker, 45 Ark. 252 (1885).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
     Equity will enjoin a railway company from taking possession of land in the construction of its road until proper compensation is made to the owner; and will on timely application also restrain the continuous, unlawful use of land without grant from the owner and without having instituted proceedings as provided in this section. Niemeyer &amp; Darragh v. Little Rock Junction Ry., 43 Ark. 111 (1884); Organ v. Memphis &amp; Little Rock R.R., 51 Ark. 235, 11 S.W. 96 (1888) (preceding decisions prior to the enactment of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c15s18-15-102" target="_self">18-15-102</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        A right-of-way conveyed to a railway company, though an easement merely, gives to the company a right to exclusive possession for railroad purposes which will support an action of ejectment against one wrongfully in possession. Graham v. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry., 69 Ark. 569, 65 S.W. 1048 (1901).

     Owner of premises abutting on a street in a city or town may recover from railway company the damages resulting to his premises by the construction of its roadbed or other structures on its right-of-way along the street, in such a manner as to obstruct access to his premises. Hot Springs R.R. v. Williamson, <cite class="us_code">136 U.S. 121</cite>, <cite class="s_court">10 S. Ct. 955</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">34 L. Ed. 355</cite> (1890).

        Where a landowner whose land is not being taken has suffered a reduction in the market value of his property by the destruction of a street abutting his property, he is entitled to compensation. Arkansas State Hwy. Comm'n v. Kesner, 239 Ark. 270, 388 S.W.2d 905 (1965).

        A landowner whose land is not being taken is not entitled to compensation for damage of the same kind as that suffered by the public in general, even though the inconvenience and injury to the particular landowner may be greater in degree than that to others.

        The manner in which the railroad passing through land cuts it up, the amount and location of the land taken, the inconvenience to the owner in passing from one part of land to another, the absence of proper crossings, and overflowing caused by the road are all proper elements of damages for taking the right-of-way. Springfield & Memphis Ry. v. Rhea, 44 Ark. 258 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        The additional fencing rendered necessary by the building of the road is an element of damages, but there is no statute or common-law principle which obliges a railroad corporation to fence its tracks or provide cattle guards where the line traverses improved lands. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Walbrink, 47 Ark. 330, 1 S.W. 545 (1886).

        The value of a track previously placed upon a tract of land without the owner's permission could not be included in the valuation of the property for compensation purposes. Newgass v. St. Louis, Ark. & Tex. Ry., 54 Ark. 140, 15 S.W. 188 (1891).
       </p>

        The owner's damages for the right-of-way to a railroad over his land cannot be diminished by the estimated benefit likely to accrue to his remaining property. St. Louis, Ark. & Tex. R.R. v. Anderson, 39 Ark. 167 (1882); Memphis & Little Rock R.R. v. Organ, 67 Ark. 84, 55 S.W. 952 (1899); Brown v. Wyandotte & Se. Ry., 68 Ark. 134, 56 S.W. 862 (1900); Little Rock & Fort Smith Ry. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although several lots of land sought to be condemned for railroad purposes are separated by an alley, they may be treated as parts of a single tract for the purpose of determining the damages if the testimony shows that they are to be used as a unit. Kansas City S. Ry. v. Boles, 88 Ark. 533, 115 S.W. 375 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a railroad has been completed through the plaintiff's land before an action is brought to recover damages for land appropriated for the right-of-way, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the damages to his land, if any, caused by closing the natural outlet for water at the high water season. Missouri & N. Ark. R.R. v. Bratton, 92 Ark. 563, 124 S.W. 231 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure of the damages is the market value of the land actually taken and the depreciation of the remaining portion without deducting the benefits that may accrue to the land by reason of the construction of the railroad. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Theodore Maxfield Co., 94 Ark. 135, 126 S.W. 83 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary for the owner to answer claiming damages to the residue of a tract of land as when a company inaugurates the statutory proceedings, it is presumed that it will perform its whole duty. Fayetteville & Little Rock Ry. v. Hunt, 51 Ark. 330, 11 S.W. 418 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to recover damages for the taking of a right-of-way, the jury may include damages to the plaintiff's land caused by a pond made thereon in the construction of the road, although the complaint alleged no special damages on that score. Arkansas Cent. R.R. v. Smith, 71 Ark. 189, 71 S.W. 947 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Witnesses who have personal knowledge of the character and location of the land, and of the facts in regard to building the railroad over it, may give their opinions as to the amount of damages sustained. Texas & St. Louis Ry. v. Kirby, 44 Ark. 103 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Great latitude is allowed the trial court in admitting or rejecting evidence of damages. Springfield & Memphis Ry. v. Rhea, 44 Ark. 258 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence to show that land condemned for a railroad bridge possesses superior advantages as a bridge site is admissible to show the market value. Little Rock Junction Ry. v. Woodruff, 49 Ark. 381, 5 S.W. 792 (1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant in a condemnation suit has, pending the suit, sold the land which the railway company seeks to condemn, he will not be required to show that he received a lower price than he would have received if the railway had not been built.

       </p>

        When the owner conveys the right-of-way by agreement, he waives in advance all damages (except those arising from faulty construction), as it is presumed that the damages are included in the purchase price. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Walbrink, 47 Ark. 330, 1 S.W. 545 (1886).

        The constitutional provision for a trial by jury to assess the damages refers only to the final assessment, and the power given the judge in this section is not violative of Ark. Const., Art. 17, § 9. Ex parte Reynolds, 52 Ark. 330, 12 S.W. 570 (1889).

        Condemnation procedures used by the gas company pursuant to this section were not preempted by 15 U.S.C.S. § 717f(h), as § 717f(h) specifically contemplated the use of state condemnation proceedings under the federal statute.GSS, LLC v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The deposit is security to the landowner for the compensation that he may be finally awarded and is subject to the court's order; none of the parties to the proceedings has a right to withdraw that deposit without an order of the court. Fort Smith & W.R.R. v. Hare, 116 Ark. 10, 172 S.W. 835 (1914).
       </p>

        The preliminary deposit designated by circuit court as a condition to entry upon lands is only security for payment of final award rather than tender which may be withdrawn by the landowner. Housing Auth. v. Rochelle, 249 Ark. 524, 459 S.W.2d 794 (1970).

           <p>
            The General Assembly finds that:
           </p>
           <p>
            “(1)From time to time, state and local regulatory programs have the effect of reducing the market value of private property;
           </p>
           <p>
            “(2)When state and local regulatory programs reduce the market value of private property and do not abate through their implementation a public nuisance affecting the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, it is fair and appropriate that the state or the locality compensate the property owner for the loss in market value of the property caused by the implementation of the regulatory program;
           </p>
           <p>
            “(3)Compensation to the property owner is also fair and appropriate in cases involving regulatory programs that abate a public nuisance when the property owner did not contribute to the public nuisance, did not acquire the property knowing of the public nuisance, or did not acquire the property under circumstances in which the property owner should have known about the public nuisance based upon prevailing community standards; and
           </p>
           <p>
            “(4)In order to establish a fair and equitable compensation system to address these stated public policy concerns and findings, the General Assembly should establish a compensation system.”

            Effective Dates. Acts 2015, No. 1002, § 4: Apr. 2, 2015. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that some actions by a governmental unit reduce the value of real property; that the property owners now are not being compensated for that reduction in value; and that this act is immediately necessary because the inequity needs to be eliminated as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the traditional deadline for notice of the termination of a lease for the next crop year is June 30; that farmers operating under an oral lease are currently vulnerable to a demand for the surrender of their land; that the certainty of a farm lease of lands is necessary before the purchase of seed, fertilizer, equipment replacement, determination of the amount of a production loan, and advanced planning required for farming operations; and that this act will provide the necessary certainty to permit efficient farming operations. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

         “(1)The decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, in Munson v. Gilliam, 543 F.2d 48 (8th Cir. 1976), and the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court in Duhon v. State, 299 Ark. 503, 774 S.W.2d 830 (Ark. 1989), upheld the constitutionality of Ark Code §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c16s18-16-101" target="_self">18-16-101</a></cite>;

            This section does not deprive a defendant of rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but is a valid exercise of the police power of the state. Poole v. State, 244 Ark. 1222, 428 S.W.2d 628 (1968); Duhon v. State, 299 Ark. 503, 774 S.W.2d 830 (1989).

           <p>
            Although landlords could use this section to evict tenants thus avoiding the use of civil processes which afford the tenant prior notice and hearing, the state was acting within its constitutional authority in providing criminal penalties for tenants who fail to pay rent so long as the federal rights of the tenants are protected by the state courts. Munson v. Gilliam, 543 F.2d 48 (8th Cir. 1976); Duhon v. State, 299 Ark. 503, 774 S.W.2d 830 (1989).

Williams v. City of Pine Bluff, 284 Ark. 551, 683 S.W.2d 923 (1985).
           </p>
           <p>
            Defendant was guilty of violating this section where written lease agreement contained no term and was a tenancy at will, and when landlord demanded he vacate or pay rent, he did neither. Polk v. State, 28 Ark. App. 282, 772 S.W.2d 368 (1989).
           </p>
           <p>
            The possibility of criminal prosecution under this section was not per se irreparable injury, so that tenants were not entitled to a preliminary injunction against prosecution for failure to pay rent. Munson v. Gilliam, 543 F.2d 48 (8th Cir. 1976).
           </p>
           <p>
            In the absence of intentional conduct motivated by a malicious or discriminatory purpose, evidence of bad faith was insufficient to justify a preliminary injunction against prosecution under this section. Munson v. Gilliam, 543 F.2d 48 (8th Cir. 1976).
           </p>
           <p>
            <p>
         Trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving jury instructions on the unlawful detainer statute and the criminal possession of real property statute because the instructions were correct statements of the law since they tracked the statutory language of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-304ol12" target="_self">18-60-304(2)</a></cite> and subsection (a) and subdivision (b)(1) of this section; there was some basis in the evidence to give the instructions because the lawfulness of the respective parties'legal right to possess real property bore on the issue of punitive damages, and the evidence did not demonstrate that an unlawful detainer action or misdemeanor charges were ever filed, but it was evident that there could have been grounds for such civil or criminal proceedings given the evidence adduced at trial.Schmidt v. Stearman, 2010 Ark. App. 274, 374 S.W.3d 254 (2010).
           </p>
           <p>
            Thirty days after service of notice to vacate constituted a reasonable period in which to vacate for a tenancy at will, and tenant became a trespasser at the end of 30 days after such notice. Polk v. State, 28 Ark. App. 282, 772 S.W.2d 368 (1989).

            Where the two owners of undivided interests in land contracted with a third party, also owner of an undivided interest, to lease lands to the third party, one owner-lessor could not procure a cancellation of the lease for failure to pay rent by the third party without joining the other owner-lessor in the proceeding. La Fargue v. La Fargue, 210 Ark. 97, 194 S.W.2d 438 (1946).

            Court erred in imposing a sentence of 30 days' imprisonment for a violation of this section as the offense is classified as a violation and is subject to punishment only in accordance with the limitations of this section. Duhon v. State, 299 Ark. 503, 774 S.W.2d 830 (1989).

        Prior to the enactment of this section, the only landlord's lien recognized in Arkansas, either by statute or common law, pertained to crops. Herringer v. Mercantile Bank, 315 Ark. 218, 866 S.W.2d 390 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The use of the word “shall” in the statute is mandatory and requires that property left in and about leased premises be considered abandoned and subject to whatever disposition made by the landlord. Harris v. Whipple, 63 Ark. App. 84, 974 S.W.2d 482 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a tenant moved her family and most of their belongings from a leased trailer, without notice to the landlord any items left in the trailer were deemed to be abandoned. Harris v. Whipple, 63 Ark. App. 84, 974 S.W.2d 482 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding against the appellant property owner in his conversion claim was improper, in part because there was no finding that appellant abandoned his personalty. Section 18-16-108 was inapplicable because, even if an oral lease existed, the appellee property owner was not a “lessor” whom the statute permitted to dispose of a tenant's property; if there was a lessor, it was appellee's son, and there was no evidence that, in taking dominion over the personalty, appellee was acting on his son's behalf.Schmidt v. Stearman, 98 Ark. App. 167, 253 S.W.3d 35 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that appellant abandoned the property it left on premises after being afforded ample opportunity to accomplish its removal; with the termination of appellant's right as a lessee in a tenancy at will to remain on the property after the trial court ordered the issuance of a writ of possession, any property left behind was abandoned.Omni Holding & Dev. Corp. v. C.A.G. Invs., Inc., 370 Ark. 220, 258 S.W.3d 374 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a tenant's property was left in the leased premises and was therefore “abandoned” under this section, the landlord was free to dispose of it as she saw fit without recourse by the tenant.Derrick v. Haynie, 2017 Ark. App. 327, 522 S.W.3d 831 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
     When the legislature adopted the landlord's lien in 1987, it was mindful of this state's longstanding aversion to a landlord's lien and of the strict construction that would be applied to such legislation, and was also aware of the law and policies embodied in the U.C.C.; the legislature never intended a landlord's lien which arose simultaneously with a purchase money security interest (see §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.04.html#t04c09s4-9-103" target="_blank">4-9-103</a></cite> and<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.04.html#t04c09s4-9-324" target="_blank">4-9-324</a></cite>) to have priority. Herringer v. Mercantile Bank, 315 Ark. 218, 866 S.W.2d 390 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Uniform Commercial Code specifically excludes landlord's liens. Herringer v. Mercantile Bank, 315 Ark. 218, 866 S.W.2d 390 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no mechanism under this section for filing a landlord's lien that would approximate the perfection requirement under the U.C.C.; therefore, under Arkansas law, the priority of a landlord's lien is dependent on the time of attachment. Herringer v. Mercantile Bank, 315 Ark. 218, 866 S.W.2d 390 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
     While a landlord's lien under this section is not a security interest under the U.C.C., and therefore not a “conflicting security interest” under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.04.html#t04c09s4-9-322" target="_blank">4-9-322</a></cite>, the landlord's lien operates, in effect, as a floating lien on after-acquired property (see §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.04.html#t04c09s4-9-204" target="_blank">4-9-204</a></cite>); it was exactly this kind of lien for which §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.04.html#t04c09s4-9-322" target="_blank">4-9-322</a></cite> was structured, in order to protect the purchase money lien creditor. Herringer v. Mercantile Bank, 315 Ark. 218, 866 S.W.2d 390 (1993).

        Arkansas Legislature decidedly approved of the caveat lessee doctrine by enacting this section.Hadder v. Heritage Hill Manor, Inc., 2016 Ark. App. 303, 495 S.W.3d 628 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was substantial evidence supporting the jury's verdict in favor of a customer in her action to recover damages when she slipped and fell on a sidewalk in front of a store when it was raining because a former employee of the store testified that she spoke with the landlord before the customer's fall and reported that the area of the sidewalk where the customer fell was dangerous; the former employee further testified that the landlord told her it would be taken care of.Dollar Gen. Corp. v. Elder, 2019 Ark. App. 526, 589 S.W.3d 437 (2019), review granted, 2020 Ark. LEXIS 72 (Feb. 20, 2020), vacated, 2020 Ark. 208 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no proof of an agreement or contractual undertaking of a legal duty to maintain or repair the leased premises. Even if the duty to protect others was assumed by the defendant, it met its duty by providing immediate basic cleanup of the water intrusion upon notification and did so in a proper manner, plus the sitter was warned to be careful and she had walked back and forth over the carpet several times before she fell.Hadder v. Heritage Hill Manor, Inc., 2016 Ark. App. 303, 495 S.W.3d 628 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in granting summary judgment for defendants because material issues of facts were in dispute regarding whether defendants assumed by conduct a duty to repair the mobile home plaintiff leased from defendants. Whether defendants performed the repairs to a refrigerator in a reasonable manner or whether the facts rose to the level of negligence was for the jury to decide.Hurd v. Hurt, 2017 Ark. App. 228, 519 S.W.3d 710 (2017).

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      <p>
       (1)(A)When grounds exist for eviction of a tenant under this subchapter, a landlord or his or her agent may commence an action for eviction by filing with a district court having jurisdiction a complaint and supporting affidavit of eviction that specifies the grounds for the eviction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The supporting affidavit shall be signed by a person with personal knowledge of the grounds for eviction.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The fee for filing an action under this chapter by a complaint with supporting affidavit of eviction shall be as provided in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c17s16-17-705" target="_blank">16-17-705</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the filing by the landlord or his or her agent or attorney of a complaint and supporting affidavit of eviction, the district court shall issue an order requiring the tenant to vacate the occupied premises or to show cause why he or she should not be evicted by the court within ten (10) calendar days after the date of service of a copy of the order upon the tenant.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto”.

          Where the state brought an action against a city to recover unclaimed utility deposits, the city was properly allowed a credit against the state's recovery for the cost to the city of its employees' working hours in determining the total amount of the deposits since this subchapter imposed a financial burden on the city which it would not have incurred had the law not been passed.

     <p>
      An item of jewelry left with a jeweler or merchant for service or repair or on consignment that is not claimed within one (1) year or by a later time if the later time is specified in writing shall be deemed abandoned property and may be disposed of under this section without recourse by or liability to the party delivering the jewelry, the owner of the jewelry, or any other party.
     </p>
     <p>
      The jeweler or merchant may dispose of the jewelry if at the time of receiving the jewelry:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Notice that the jewelry is deemed abandoned under this section shall be sent by certified mail to each current mailing address that has been supplied to the jeweler or merchant at least fifteen (15) days prior to the sale or other disposition of the jewelry, or a different time period if agreed to by the parties in writing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The failure of the party delivering the jewelry, the owner of the jewelry, or any other interested party to supply a current mailing address in order to receive notice of the sale or other disposition of the jewelry is a waiver of any right, claim, or interest in the jewelry.

       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       (1)The funds received under this subchapter, including the proceeds from the sale of abandoned property, shall be deposited by the administrator into a special trust fund to be known as the “Unclaimed Property Proceeds Trust Fund”, from which he or she shall make prompt payment of claims allowed by him or her as provided under this subchapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funds shall be deposited into accounts in one (1) or more financial institutions authorized to do business in this state and may then be transferred into the State Treasury Money Management Trust to be administered in accordance with the laws of this state.
      </p>
      <p>
       (A)Before making the deposit, the administrator shall record:
      </p>
      <p>
       The name and last known address of each person appearing from the holder's reports to be entitled to the abandoned property;
      </p>
      <p>
       The name and last known address of each insured or annuitant; and
      </p>
      <p>
       The policy or contract number, the name of the life insurance corporation, and the amount due under each policy or contract listed in the report of a life insurance corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The record shall be available for public inspection at all reasonable business hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of each fiscal year, the administrator shall withdraw from the Unclaimed Property Proceeds Trust Fund an amount necessary to reimburse the State Central Services Fund, or its successor fund or fund account, for moneys expended for personal services and operating expenses of administering and enforcing this subchapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1)(A)(i)At least one (1) time each fiscal year, the administrator shall transfer to the treasurer of the reporting county all funds collected from that county that have not been claimed and that have been held for a full three (3) years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funds received by the treasurer shall be deposited into the general fund of the reporting county.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reporting county may use the funds for any purpose for which it may use general revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   (i)After the administrator returns funds to the county, the state is released from its indemnity of the county under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c28s18-28-210ol1b" target="_self">18-28-210(b)</a></cite> and (f).
      </p>
      <p>
       The county receiving the funds shall maintain an accounting of the funds in perpetuity, unless payment upon a valid claim is made.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the rightful owner or the owner's heirs or assigns ever appear and petition the county for the return of the funds after providing proof of ownership, the county shall pay the funds to the rightful owner from the general fund of the county.
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of this section, “proof of ownership” means a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that the person petitioning the county is, in fact, the rightful owner, heir, or assignee.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least one (1) time each fiscal year, the administrator shall transfer to the general revenues of the state all remaining funds that have been collected and held for a full three (3) years, less the amount transferred to the State Central Services Fund, or its successor fund or fund account, as required by this subchapter.

     <p>
      <p>
   Within ninety (90) days after a claim is filed, the administrator shall allow or deny the claim and give written notice of the decision to the claimant.

     <p>
      <p>
   (1)Except as provided in subdivision (c)(2) of this section, within thirty (30) days after a claim is allowed, the property or the net proceeds of a sale of the property must be delivered or paid by the administrator to the claimant, together with any dividend, interest, or other increment to which the claimant is entitled under §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c28s18-28-211" target="_self">18-28-211</a></cite> and<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c28s18-28-212" target="_self">18-28-212</a></cite>.

     <p>
      If in order to transfer property to the claimant under this section, fees or costs are required to be paid prior to transfer, the administrator may sell all or a portion of the property and deduct the costs of transfer from the proceeds of the sale, and any proceeds remaining shall be paid to the claimant.

     <p>
      <p>
   A holder who pays the owner for property that has been delivered to the state and which, if claimed from the administrator by the owner would be subject to an increment under §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c28s18-28-211" target="_self">18-28-211</a></cite> and<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c28s18-28-212" target="_self">18-28-212</a></cite>, may recover from the administrator the amount of the increment.

        18-28-225. Agreement to locate property.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       An agreement by an owner, the primary purpose of which is to locate, deliver, recover, or assist in the recovery of property that is presumed abandoned is void and unenforceable if it was entered into during the period commencing on the date the property was presumed abandoned and extending to a time that is twenty-four (24) months after the date the property is paid or delivered to the administrator. This subsection does not apply to an owner's agreement with an attorney to file a claim as to identified property or contest the administrator's denial of a claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement by an owner, the primary purpose of which is to locate, deliver, recover, or assist in the recovery of property is enforceable only if the agreement is in writing, provides for a fee of not more than ten percent (10%) of the recovery, clearly sets forth the nature of the property and the services to be rendered, is signed by the apparent owner, and states the value of the property before and after the fee or other compensation has been deducted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an agreement covered by this section applies to mineral proceeds and the agreement contains a provision to pay compensation that includes a portion of the underlying minerals or any mineral proceeds not then presumed abandoned, the provision is void and unenforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement covered by this section which provides for compensation that is unconscionable is unenforceable except by the owner. An owner who has agreed to pay compensation that is unconscionable, or the administrator on behalf of the owner, may maintain an action to reduce the compensation to a conscionable amount. The court may award reasonable attorney's fees to an owner who prevails in the action.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not preclude an owner from asserting that an agreement covered by this section is invalid on grounds other than unconscionable compensation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      (1)(A)All mineral proceeds that are held or owing by the holder and that have remained unclaimed by the owner for longer than three (3) years after the mineral proceeds became payable or distributable are presumed abandoned.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   Abandoned mineral proceeds are subject to the unclaimed property provisions of the Unclaimed Property Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c28s18-28-201" target="_self">18-28-201</a></cite> et seq., except that funds received by the Auditor of State under this section shall be deposited by the Auditor of State into a special trust fund to be known as the “Abandoned Mineral Proceeds Trust Fund”.
     </p>
     <p>
      The funds shall be deposited into accounts in one (1) or more financial institutions authorized to do business in this state and may then be transferred into the State Treasury Money Management Trust to be administered in accordance with the laws of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)However, upon petition of the county attorney of the county in which the abandoned minerals were produced or severed, abandoned mineral proceeds that are held pursuant to leases executed by receivers or their successors appointed by a court of proper jurisdiction, shall be remitted by the holder to the county in which the minerals were produced or severed and deposited into the county general fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The county attorney shall publish notice of his or her petition in a legal newspaper having general circulation in the county, and the notice shall be published at least one (1) time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The holder of abandoned mineral proceeds turned over to the Auditor of State under this section shall provide the following information to the Auditor of State:
     </p>
     <p>
      The name and last known address of the property owner;
     </p>
     <p>
      The applicable well name, uncontrolled lease name, or unitized area name as recognized by the Oil and Gas Commission;
     </p>
     <p>
      Either:
     </p>
     <p>
      The county, section, township, and range of the well; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The county, section, township, and range from which the abandoned minerals were severed or produced; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Any other information required by the Auditor of State.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Abandoned Mineral Proceeds Trust Fund shall be used by the Auditor of State to pay the claims of persons establishing ownership of mineral proceeds in possession of the state under this subchapter and for the enforcement and administration of this subchapter. At least one (1) time each fiscal year, the Auditor of State shall transfer to the County Aid Fund in the State Treasury all funds in the Abandoned Mineral Proceeds Trust Fund in excess of an amount determined by the Auditor of State to be sufficient to pay the anticipated expenses and claims of the Abandoned Mineral Proceeds Trust Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Funds credited to the County Aid Fund pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter shall annually be equally distributed among all the counties in the state by the Treasurer of State.
     </p>
     <p>

Emergency clause provided: “The General Assembly finds it to be a fact, and so declares, that many instruments contain defective acknowledgments due to errors in the preparation thereof, without fault upon the part of the person, firm or corporation so executing said instruments; that these defective acknowledgments hamper the sale of real estate throughout the State and retard the development of industries and other businesses in the State of Arkansas; that this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

        Acts 1973, No. 604, § 4: Apr. 5, 1973. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the provisions of Section 1 of Act No. 260 of 1911 relating to the methods of giving notice that payment has been made upon an existing indebtedness are at this time inadequate and should be enlarged, as the present provisions for the giving of such notice are unduly restrictive, are a deterrent to the obtaining of financing for agricultural, commercial and industrial purposes in the State of Arkansas, and that it is immediately necessary to correct this undesirable situation. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in effect from the date of its passage and approval.”

        Acts 2015, No. 918, § 2: Apr. 1, 2015. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that historically low interest rates make conditions favorable for the citizens of this state to obtain financing to purchase or refinance a home; that the ability to close the purchase or refinance of a home at a favorable interest rate can save citizens thousands of dollars on one of their largest and most important investments; that delays due to the failure to timely release a mortgage after the mortgage has been paid can result in immediate and substantial harm; that due to mortgage industry practices it can be extremely difficult to locate the proper lender to obtain a mortgage release and therefore an immediate need exists to provide an alternative method to obtain the release. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto isoverridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Mitchell v. Federal Land Bank, 206 Ark. 253, 174 S.W.2d 671 (1943), superseded by statute as stated in, Croft v. Croft, 8 Ark. App. 20, 648 S.W.2d 511 (1983).

      One owning a royalty interest in land may plead the statute of limitation as against a foreclosure of a prior mortgage where he was not a party to the foreclosure and there was no endorsement on the mortgage record extending the time of maturity of the mortgage. Arrington v. United Royalty Co., 188 Ark. 270, 65 S.W.2d 36 (1933).

      Where a bank took two mortgages on the same property and assigned one, the bank was not a “third party” and could not invoke the benefit of the statute requiring the extension of maturity of such assigned mortgage to be endorsed on the mortgage record. Wasson v. Tapscott, 188 Ark. 771, 67 S.W.2d 728 (1934).

      Judgment creditors of mortgagors to whom deeds of trust were executed to secure their judgments were not strangers or third parties to mortgage within the protection of this section. Gibson v. Doughty, 193 Ark. 1037, 104 S.W.2d 449 (1937).
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchaser from mortgagor, his grantee and purchaser from grantee's administratrix at sale ordered by probate court, were all third parties protected against mortgagee's successor where no notation of payment was made on the record for five years after maturity of note secured by the mortgage, mere knowledge of debt being insufficient to prevent the statutory bar. Hamburg Bank v. Zimmerman, 196 Ark. 849, 120 S.W.2d 380 (1938).
     </p>
     <p>
      Grantee of mortgaged premises who, though he did not assume and agree to pay the mortgaged indebtedness, bought subject to it and his deed so specifically provided, is not a third party within the meaning of this section so as to be entitled to their protection, and his widow and heirs have no better standing as third parties than he did. Henry v. Coe, 200 Ark. 44, 137 S.W.2d 897 (1940).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where payments tolling the statute of limitations were made by mortgagor but not endorsed on margin of record, after five years from due date of indebtedness described in the mortgage, junior mortgage became superior even though junior mortgagee knew of prior mortgage, since it was not shown that he was other than a stranger or third person to such mortgage.

       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court reversed and remanded trial court's cancellation of mortgage because subsection (c) of this section did not apply to a mortgage that had not yet been satisfied; on remand, the trial court did not err in denying bank's request for interest, costs, penalties, and attorney's fees because it found that those had accrued solely due to bank's wrongful actions.

        Attorney's fees should not have been awarded in an action involving a mortgagee's failure to cancel a mortgage because the action was not primarily based on contract; the action was based on a violation of this section and negligence.

        In a suit for failure to satisfy a mortgage, the fact that the attorney for the mortgagee endorsed upon a decree of the chancery court payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage did not comply with this section. Barnett v. Bank of Malvern, 176 Ark. 766, 4 S.W.2d 17 (1928).

       </p>
       <p>
        Although it was not his duty to record a release, the purchaser of mortgaged property who paid the balance due on the account, upon being tendered an unrecorded release, was under duty to minimize any damage he might sustain due to the refusal of the vendor to record the release by recording it himself and was therefore not entitled to recover damages resulting from failure to record. Hatch v. Lowrance, 178 Ark. 274, 10 S.W.2d 358 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not error to instruct the jury that under this section substantial recovery was intended as punishment against the mortgagee for refusing to comply with the request. Barnett v. Bank of Malvern, 183 Ark. 1030, 39 S.W.2d 1014 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Refusal to satisfy lien or mortgage securing notes, where no actual damage or loss was established, did not justify imposition of penalty. Price v. Center, 200 Ark. 19, 138 S.W.2d 391 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court's finding that two mortgagors suffered actual monetary damages as a result of a mortgagee's failure to cancel a mortgage was not clearly erroneous, a penalty was properly awarded; however, the court did not have the authority to cancel the mortgage where debt was still owed, and the record did not show that the court intended to cancel the mortgage in lieu of awarding damages. Nationsbanc Mortg. Corp. v. Hopkins, 82 Ark. App. 91, 114 S.W.3d 757 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary that both joint mortgagors request the entry of “satisfaction” but the one paying the debt is sufficient. Johns v. Rollison, 152 Ark. 52, 237 S.W. 448 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Service of summons upon a domestic corporation was ineffective where mortgagee corporation's employee, who picked up and signed for the certified mail, was not listed in any file at either the post office or the Secretary of State's office as an agent for service of registered mail, nor had express authority to receive restricted mail. Henry v. Gaines-Derden Enters., Inc., 314 Ark. 542, 863 S.W.2d 828 (1993).

        This section does not apply to maker of a note or his heirs. Vance v. White, 180 Ark. 470, 180 Ark. 471, 21 S.W.2d 853 (1929); Lehman v. First Nat'l Bank, 189 Ark. 604, 74 S.W.2d 773 (1934).

        The duty imposed upon the assignee of a mortgage to satisfy it when paid is not affected by the fact that his assignment is not of record. Adams v. McKay & Binns Inv. Co., 155 Ark. 556, 244 S.W. 708 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        The assignee of a note or debt secured by lien takes by the assignment, the lien securing the debt, but if he neglects to have the memorandum showing the transfer endorsed on the record, he is subject to have his lien defeated if satisfaction of the lien is endorsed by the apparent owner of the lien. Kinney v. North Memphis Sav. Bank, 178 Ark. 716, 11 S.W.2d 486 (1928); Farmers' Bank & Trust Co. v. Taylor, 189 Ark. 939, 75 S.W.2d 808 (1934).

        An assignment of a mortgage need not be recorded to be valid against later claims against the assignor. Bryan v. Easton Tire Co., 262 Ark. 731, 561 S.W.2d 79 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A note and mortgage are inseparable and an assignment of the note will carry the mortgage, although an assignment of a mortgage alone is a nullity and, accordingly, a garnishment took priority over an assignment of a mortgage without the accompanying note. Bryan v. Easton Tire Co., 262 Ark. 731, 561 S.W.2d 79 (1978).

Emergency clause provided: “Whereas, many landlords who hold rent contracts, notes, or other evidences of debt and lien for rent on lands rented by them, desire to pledge, mortgage or encumber said evidences of debt and liens, now given them under the law, and that said pledge is a necessary part of the financing of the interest of a landlord in the crops now growing and to be grown, an emergency is declared to exist, and all laws and parts of laws in conflict herewith, are hereby repealed and this act shall be in force and effect from and after its passage.”

The inadvertent changes have resulted in widespread confusion which threatens to seriously disrupt the traditional process of crop loans and farm land tenancy in this state's largest industry. This confusion and unintended result will continue until this act becomes effective. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     <p>
      “The General Assembly has determined that by the enactment of Act 1439 of 2001 it inadvertently changed the law regarding landlords' liens on crops. It is the intent of this act to correct that inadvertent change, remove landlords' liens on crops from the application of the Uniform Commercial Code, reestablish Arkansas Code 18-41-101 and 18-41-103 as the law applicable to landlords' liens on crops, and thereby make landlords' liens under Arkansas Code 18-41-101 and 18-41-103 superior to all other liens on the same collateral.”

      A tenant who agrees to pay as rent part of crop raised by him on the land or its value cannot refuse to account for it because that portion could not be gathered without much inconvenience and unusual expense. To excuse a failure to perform the contract, the tenant must show that it was caused by the act of God, of the landlord, or of the public enemy. Johnson v. Bryant, 61 Ark. 312, 32 S.W. 1081 (1895).

      Lien becomes a charge on the crop as soon as the crop comes into existence. Murphy v. Myar, 95 Ark. 32, 128 S.W. 359 (1910).
     </p>
     <p>
      A rent contract which includes other indebtedness expressed as rent is a lien on the tenant's crop only for the amount of the actual rent. Roth & Co. v. Williams, 45 Ark. 447 (1885).
     </p>
     <p>
      Landlord has lien only on crop grown in a year for which rent is due. Mills v. Pryor, 65 Ark. 214, 45 S.W. 350 (1898); Henry v. Irby, 170 Ark. 928, 282 S.W. 3 (1926).
     </p>
     <p>
      The lien is confined to the rent and advances necessary to make and gather the crop, and cannot be made to cover damages for breach of the lease. Few v. Mitchell, 80 Ark. 243, 96 S.W. 983 (1906).
     </p>
     <p>
      A contract requiring the lessee to repair the fence is part of the price of the rent for which the landlord has a lien. Von Berg v. Goodman, 85 Ark. 605, 109 S.W. 1006 (1908).
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a lien on the entire crop for the rent whether the crop is raised by a tenant or a subtenant. Jacobson v. Atkins, 103 Ark. 91, 146 S.W. 133 (1912).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where rent is payable in money, the landlord has a lien for all the rent on the crop raised even though part of the land was not cultivated by the tenant. Stephenson v. Lewis, 152 Ark. 361, 238 S.W. 61 (1922).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where part of rented land was kept out of production and rented to federal government by agreement between landlord and tenant, a landlord's lien for the rent of such land could not be asserted against crops raised on other parts of the land by tenant's sharecroppers. Dulaney v. Balls, 193 Ark. 701, 102 S.W.2d 88 (1937).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a tenant's crop was purchased and sold with knowledge that rent was due and unpaid, the landlord's remedy, if any, is by specific attachment of the crop while it is in the purchaser's hands, or by bill in equity after a sale, to have the proceeds appropriated to payment of rents, but not an action for money had and received. Reavis v. Barnes, 36 Ark. 575 (1880); Anderson & Co. v. Bowles, 44 Ark. 108 (1884).
     </p>

      Landlord cannot sue trespasser for damages to tenant's crop. St. Louis, Ark. & Tex. Ry. v. Trigg, 63 Ark. 536, 40 S.W. 579 (1897).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a tenant delivers his crop to a mortgagee without having first discharged the landlord's lien, the landlord's remedy is a specific attachment of the cotton in the mortgagee's hands. Ferniman v. Nowlin, 91 Ark. 20, 120 S.W. 378 (1909).
     </p>
     <p>
      A cause of action of a landlord having a lien on his tenant's crop against a bank for receiving the proceeds of sale of the crop with notice of the lien is barred by the six months statute of limitations; the remedy being in equity to impress a lien upon the proceeds of the crop in the bank's hands. Bottrell v. Farmers' Bank & Trust Co., 172 Ark. 1165, 291 S.W. 832 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a tenant removed a portion of the crop without authority at a time when he was indebted to the landlord for rent, the landlord was entitled to attach crops grown on the premises by virtue of the lien thereon. Stone v. Yount, 174 Ark. 825, 296 S.W. 717 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where during the pendency of a landlord's attachment suit to enforce his landlord's lien for rent and supplies, the tenant took the property out of the custody of the court and converted it to his own use, the landlord's remedy was by a bill in equity after the sale to have the proceeds appropriated to the payment of his rents. Clemmons v. Byars, 197 Ark. 300, 122 S.W.2d 652 (1938).
     </p>
     <p>
      An action by the landlord against one taking the crop with a knowledge of the existence of the lien will be barred in six months after the maturity of the rent. King & Clopton v. Blount, 37 Ark. 115 (1881).
     </p>
     <p>
      The lien expires in six months after the rent is due. Cocke v. Clausen, 67 Ark. 455, 55 S.W. 846 (1900); Taylor v. Crawford, 187 Ark. 316, 59 S.W.2d 484 (1933).
     </p>
     <p>
      The lien of a landlord is superior to a mortgage on the crop by the tenant. Tomlinson v. Greenfield, 31 Ark. 557 (1876); Lambeth v. Ponder, 33 Ark. 707 (1878); Watson v. Johnson, 33 Ark. 737 (1878); Meyer v. Bloom, 37 Ark. 43 (1881).

     <p>
      <p>
     The lien provided by this section and the one provided by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c41s18-41-103" target="_self">18-41-103</a></cite> are of equal dignity and are prior to the lien of a mortgage on the crop by the tenant. Morgan v. Russell, 151 Ark. 405, 236 S.W. 602 (1922).
     </p>
     <p>
      A landlord's lien on his tenant's crop is superior to the lien of laborers asserting liens thereon. Campbell v. Anderson, 189 Ark. 671, 74 S.W.2d 782 (1934).
     </p>
     <p>
      Landlords'lien interest in the crop proceeds took priority over a perfected security interest that a creditor bank had in the same proceeds, regardless of when the bank's conflicting security interest was perfected.Bank of McCrory v. Morrison (In re James), 368 B.R. 800 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2007).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     While lessor may have come within the definition of “owner“ as set forth in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.02.html#t02c17s2-17-301ol13" target="_blank">2-17-301(3)</a></cite> [now (2)] because of an interest in the grain under its statutory landlord's lien, under this section, this lien existed for only six months. Rufus Comer Farms v. First State Bank, 47 Ark. App. 3, 884 S.W.2d 265 (1994).
     </p>
     <p>
      The landlord's lien is not lost by the tenant's sale of the crop to a purchaser with notice. Volmer v. Wharton, 34 Ark. 691 (1879).
     </p>
     <p>
      The statutory lien of a landlord for rent and supplies furnished is not enforceable against one who purchased the crops from the tenant in good faith and without notice of the landlord's claim. Hunter v. Matthews, 67 Ark. 362, 55 S.W. 144 (1900).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who purchased cotton which he knew was grown on rented land and who had notice of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry could not, as against landlord's lien, claim that he was an innocent purchaser because the tenant misled him into thinking that landlord had abandoned his claim for rent. Pape v. Steward, 69 Ark. 306, 63 S.W. 47 (1901).
     </p>
     <p>
      A purchaser of a tenant's crop takes charge with notice of the landlord's lien if he knew that the relation of landlord and tenant had existed during the previous year and had no reason to believe that such relationship had ceased to exist. Judge v. Curtis, 72 Ark. 132, 78 S.W. 746 (1904).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a landlord attaches cotton in the hands of a purchaser who is not an innocent purchaser, and such purchaser executes a forthcoming bond and sells the cotton, he becomes liable to the landlord for the amount due him for rents and supplies. First Nat'l Bank v. Duvall, 156 Ark. 377, 246 S.W. 471 (1923).

      Where tenants who had right to sell crops grown on rented farmland had previously paid the rent on time, no action on part of the landlords to protect their lien as against buyer of crops was required; and the buyer, which was unquestionably on notice that landlords' lien existed, was not entitled to ignore the lien. Holmes v. Riceland Foods, Inc., 261 Ark. 27, 546 S.W.2d 414 (1977).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, the trust's statutory lien was not enforceable against the buyer because it bought rice from the tenant in good faith and had no evidence which would require the buyer to make an investigation regarding a landlord's lien.Riceland Foods, Inc. v. Pearson, 2009 Ark. 520, 357 S.W.3d 434 (2009).
     </p>
     <p>
      Vendor of land reserving lien on crops has equitable mortgage even though it is called landlord's lien in the conveyance. Martin v. Schichtl, 60 Ark. 595, 31 S.W. 458 (1895).
     </p>
     <p>
      Landlord's lien cannot arise in sale of land. Smith v. Maberry, 61 Ark. 515, 33 S.W. 1068 (1896).
     </p>
     <p>
      The mortgagee cannot recover the crop from one holding it for payment of rent, without first tendering the rent due. Buck v. Lee, 36 Ark. 525 (1880).
     </p>
     <p>
      The landlord's lien is not extinguished by a refusal to accept a tender of the rent and to make a plea of such tender available, the money must be paid into court. Bloom v. McGehee, 38 Ark. 329 (1881).
     </p>
     <p>
      Legal title to cotton grown by tenant is in him until disposed of and landlord has a lien, enforceable within six months from due date of rent. Commodity Credit Corp. v. Usrey, 199 Ark. 406, 133 S.W.2d 887 (1939).
     </p>
     <p>
      A landlord does not waive his lien by taking a mortgage on the crop. Franklin v. Meyer, 36 Ark. 96 (1880); Merchants' & Planters' Bank v. Meyer, 56 Ark. 499, 20 S.W. 406 (1892).
     </p>
     <p>
      A landlord by consenting to the removal and sale of a crop of cotton upon which he has a lien for rents loses his lien as against one purchasing the cotton, or advancing money upon it as a security in good faith and without notice of the lien. May v. McGaughey, 60 Ark. 357, 30 S.W. 417 (1895).
     </p>
     <p>
      Waiver of landlord's lien in favor of mortgagee is personal, and does not pass with assignment of the deed of trust. Neeley v. Phillips, 70 Ark. 90, 66 S.W. 349 (1902).
     </p>
     <p>
      Lien is waived by receiving proceeds of sale of a crop of cotton. Noe v. Layton, 76 Ark. 582, 89 S.W. 1005 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      A landlord who agrees that a part of a subtenant's crop shall be applied to the claim of a supply merchant does not thereby waive his lien on the remainder of such crop. Jacobson v. Atkins, 103 Ark. 91, 146 S.W. 133 (1912).
     </p>
     <p>
      The lien is not waived by taking a note with personal security, in the absence of proof that it was so intended by the parties. Cole v. Turner, 108 Ark. 537, 158 S.W. 493 (1913).
     </p>
     <p>
      A landlord's statutory lien is paramount lien of which every person must take notice and generally can be lost only by waiver or failure to enforce it at the proper time. Blackwood v. Farmers Bank & Trust Co., 200 Ark. 738, 141 S.W.2d 1 (1940).

It is the intent of this act to correct that inadvertent change, remove landlords' liens on crops from the application of the Uniform Commercial Code, reestablish Arkansas Code 18-41-101 and 18-41-103 as the law applicable to landlords' liens on crops, and thereby make landlords' liens under Arkansas Code 18-41-101 and 18-41-103 superior to all other liens on the same collateral.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Amendments. The 2003 amendment redesignated former (a) as present (a)(1) and added (a)(2).
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2017 amendment deleted “or justice of the peace” preceding “having jurisdiction” in (c).

     <p>
      A landlord who signed a note as surety for his tenant to secure rice bags to enable his tenant to preserve his rice crop and who was in effect primarily liable on the note was, on paying the note, entitled to a lien on the rice therefor.

     </p>
     <p>
      Where landlord endorsed note for tenants to enable tenants to have combine repaired and paid the note upon default of tenants, landlord was entitled to landlord's lien on crop raised. Grisham Butane Gas Co. v. Mason, 224 Ark. 969, 278 S.W.2d 102 (1955).
     </p>
     <p>
      The landlord has a lien for the price of any article furnished which was reasonably necessary in making or gathering the crop, and it is not essential that the article furnished shall have been for direct use in the cultivation. Earl Bros. & Co. v. Malone, 80 Ark. 218, 96 S.W. 1062 (1906).
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      The lien of the landlord must be enforced in the mode pointed out by this section, since he has no title to the crop even though the tenant surrendered possession. Upham v. Dodd, 24 Ark. (11 Barber) 545 (1867).

     <p>
      This section gives the landlord a lien upon the crop raised upon the premises and not upon the things advanced; therefore, if no crop is raised upon the premises, there can be no lien. Laughlin v. Tyler, 177 Ark. 1183, 9 S.W.2d 567 (1928).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a landlord brought suit seeking to enforce his lien on his tenant's crop for supplies furnished for the purpose of making such crop and a mortgagee of the crop brought replevin against the landlord for the possession of the crop, the landlord's lien was paramount to the mortgage lien and the judgment was properly rendered enforcing the landlord's lien. Ferniman v. Nowlin, 91 Ark. 20, 120 S.W. 378 (1909).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a tenant to whom the landlord had made advances went to war and his father took over his crop and cultivated and gathered it, the landlord's lien for rent and advances was superior to the rights of the father. Embry v. Neighbors, 139 Ark. 313, 213 S.W. 741 (1919).

     The lien provided by this section and the one provided by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c41s18-41-101" target="_self">18-41-101</a></cite> are of equal dignity and are prior to the lien of a mortgage on the crop by the tenant. Morgan v. Russell, 151 Ark. 405, 236 S.W. 602 (1922).
     </p>
     <p>
      A landowner's right to a lien for advances on a sharecropper's interest in the crop is superior to the lien of laborers. Campbell v. Anderson, 189 Ark. 671, 74 S.W.2d 782 (1934).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who purchases a tenant's crops under circumstances that would put him on notice of his landlord's lien for supplies takes subject thereto. Neal v. Brandon, 70 Ark. 79, 66 S.W. 200 (1902).
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasers of the crop who paid proceeds to landlord were not bound to take notice of any waiver other than an endorsement of waiver and were only bound to show as against other liens the existence of a valid lien on the part of the landlord in an amount equal to or greater than the price paid by them in purchasing the crop. Chronister Bros. & Co. v. Oswalt, 175 Ark. 337, 299 S.W. 9 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      A purchaser of rented land from the owner, who pays the landlord, as part of the purchase price of the land, the amount the tenants owe him for supplies, is entitled to a lien on the crops as against mortgagees thereof. Oberste Bros. v. Crabtree, 175 Ark. 107, 299 S.W. 6 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      A landlord may waive his lien for advances to an employee only by written endorsement upon the mortgage or other instrument by which the employee transfers his interest in crops. Tinsley v. Craig, 54 Ark. 346, 15 S.W. 897 (1891). But see, Griggs v. Horton, 84 Ark. 623, 104 S.W. 930 (1907).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a landlord agrees to a transfer of the lease from the tenant to a subtenant, and recovers judgment against the tenant and the tenant's surety, the landlord will be held to have waived, by his conduct, his landlord's lien upon the crops of his tenants. Cole v. Turner, 108 Ark. 537, 158 S.W. 493 (1913).
     </p>
     <p>
      Proof of a landlord's knowledge that her tenant was being furnished supplies by a mercantile firm would not establish a waiver of the landlord's lien. Fletcher v. Dunn, 188 Ark. 734, 67 S.W.2d 579 (1934).

   <p>
    Whenever any landlord shall endorse, upon any written agreement made by and between his or her tenant and the employees of the tenant, his or her written consent to the terms of the agreement, then, and in that case only, the lien of the employees shall have precedence over that of the landlord.
   </p>

   </h3>
   <ol class="alpha">
    <li id="t18c41s18-41-108ol1a">
     Any landlord who has a lien on the crop for rent shall be entitled to bring suit before a circuit court having jurisdiction and have a writ of attachment for the recovery of it, whether the rent is due or not, in the following cases:
     <ol>
      <li id="t18c41s18-41-108ol1a1">
       If the tenant is about to remove the crop from the premises without paying the rent; or
      </li>
      <li id="t18c41s18-41-108ol1a2">
       If he or she has removed the crop, or any portion thereof, without the consent of the landlord.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="t18c41s18-41-108ol1b">
     <ol>
      <li id="t18c41s18-41-108ol1b1">
       Before the writ of attachment is issued, the landlord or his or her agent or attorney shall file an affidavit of one (1) of the facts under subdivision (a)(1) or subdivision (a)(2) of this section, that the amount claimed is or will be due for rent, or will be the value of the portion of the crop agreed as rent, stating the time the rent became or would become due and that he or she has a lien on the crop for rent.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c41s18-41-108ol1b2">
       The landlord or his or her agent or attorney shall file with the clerk of the court a bond to the defendant, with sufficient security, in double the amount of his or her claim as sworn to, conditioned that he or she will prove his or her debt or demand and his or her lien in a trial, or that he or she will pay damages against him or her.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="t18c41s18-41-108ol1c">
     The writ of attachment may be levied on the crop in the possession of the tenant or anyone holding it in his or her right or in the possession of a purchaser from him or her with notice of the lien of the landlord.
    </li>
    <li id="t18c41s18-41-108ol1d">
     If the rent is not due at the commencement of the suit, the trial shall be stayed until it becomes due, and the attachment, at any time before final trial, may be dissolved in the manner prescribed by law, and the cause proceed as other suits.
     <p>
      Amendments. The 2017 amendment, in the introductory language of (a), substituted “circuit court having jurisdiction” for “justice of the peace or in the circuit court, as the case may be”; substituted “If” for “When” in (a)(1) and (a)(2); in (b)(1), substituted “is issued” for “shall issue”, deleted “make and” preceding “file”, substituted “under” for “provided for in”, and deleted “which shall be therein stated” following “claimed”, “to be received” following “agreed”, and “when” following “the time”; in (b)(2), substituted “the clerk of the court” for “the justice or clerk, as the case may be”, and deleted “of law” following “trial” and “as shall be adjudged” following “damages”; and substituted “If the rent is not due” for “If the rent shall not be due” in (d).

     <p>
      If attachment is sustained, there can be no damages for its wrongful issuance or levy. Stone v. Yount, 174 Ark. 825, 296 S.W. 717 (1927).

    A sharecropper has a contingent interest in the crop which he may mortgage. The laborer's lien statute has been construed to give cropper a lien on the crop grown for his labor, which is superior to a mortgage on the crop given by the employer even where the mortgage is prior in point of time.

    Where employee is entitled to a specific portion of the sale proceeds of the crop, the remedy at law for damages would not be “adequate” and, since imposing a lien and constructive trust constitutes appropriate remedy in the chancery court, employer's motion to transfer to the circuit court was properly denied.

      Publisher's Notes. As enacted, Acts 1868, No. 64, § 5, contained jurisdictional amounts of two hundred dollars ($200) for exclusive jurisdiction and five hundred dollars ($500) for concurrent jurisdiction. The section has been rewritten to conform to the jurisdictional amounts for justice of the peace courts set forth in Ark. Const., Art. 7, § 40 [repealed].
     </p>
     <p>
      Amendments. The 2017 amendment substituted “by an action before a court having jurisdiction” for “shall, if the amount is less than one hundred dollars ($100), and may, at his or her own discretion, if the amount does not exceed three hundred dollars ($300), go before any justice of the peace in the county where the lien exists” in (a)(1).

     The Arkansas mechanic's and materialman's lien provisions, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-101" target="_self">18-44-101</a></cite> et seq. reached a constitutional accommodation of the respective interests of creditors, debtors and the public and the property interests affected were not such that minimum due process standards required more than the statutes afforded in the way of notice and hearing; accordingly, such statutes did not violate Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 8. South Cent. Dist. of Pentecostal Church of God of Am., Inc. v. Bruce-Rogers Co., 269 Ark. 130, 599 S.W.2d 702 (1980); Bruce-Rogers Supply Co. v. Petty Plumbing, Inc., 270 Ark. 63, 603 S.W.2d 445 (1980).
     </p>
     <p>
      The Arkansas statutes authorizing the filing and enforcement of mechanics' and materialmen's liens do not allow the taking of a substantial property interest to an extent sufficient to render the statutes unconstitutional as violative of due process of law. Paragould Paint & Glass, Inc. v. Rodgers, 269 Ark. 191, 599 S.W.2d 709 (1980).
     </p>
     <p>
      The materialmen's lien law is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. Scott v. Le Grande, 225 Ark. 1022, 287 S.W.2d 456 (1956).
     </p>
     <p>
      One must be in privity of contract with a subcontractor or contractor to avail himself of a mechanic's lien; therefore, the supplier of a materialman is outside this subchapter. Valley Metal Works, Inc. v. A.O. Smith-Inland, Inc., 264 Ark. 341, 572 S.W.2d 138 (1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      Liens of mechanics and materialmen for work done or materials furnished in the construction of an improvement are creatures of the statute creating them and must be perfected and enforced according to its provisions. Royal Theater Co. v. Collins, 102 Ark. 539, 144 S.W. 919 (1912); Doke v. Benton County Lumber Co., 114 Ark. 1, 169 S.W. 327 (1914); Young Men's Bldg. Ass'n v. Ware, 158 Ark. 137, 249 S.W. 545 (1923).
     </p>
     <p>
      There must be a substantial compliance with the statutes regarding the filing of mechanics' and materialmen's liens unless the owner has, by contract or waiver, or in some manner by his conduct, estopped himself from insisting upon such compliance. Conway Lumber Co. v. Hardin, 119 Ark. 43, 177 S.W. 408 (1915).
     </p>
     <p>
      This subchapter covers the whole subject of mechanics' and materialmen's liens and repealed prior acts on the subject. Barton v. Grand Lodge, 71 Ark. 35, 70 S.W. 305 (1902), overruled on other grounds, Long v. Abeles & Co., 77 Ark. 156, 93 S.W. 67 (1905).

     </p>
     <p>
      This section is to be strictly construed because it is an extraordinary remedy not available to every merchant or worker. Christy v. Nabholz Supply Co., 261 Ark. 127, 546 S.W.2d 425 (1977); Valley Metal Works, Inc. v. A.O. Smith-Inland, Inc., 264 Ark. 341, 572 S.W.2d 138 (1978); Ragsdell v. Gazaway Lumber Co., 11 Ark.

      The 1969 amendment to subsection (a) of this section made improvements to land lienable. BB & B Constr. Co. v. FDIC, 316 Ark. 663, 875 S.W.2d 48 (1994).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Although this section provides which materialman shall receive protection by a land improvement lien as well as the nature and the extent of the lien, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-110" target="_self">18-44-110</a></cite> still sets forth the priority of these liens to other encumbrances and the nature of the lien's attachment. BB &amp; B Constr. Co. v. FDIC, 316 Ark. 663, 875 S.W.2d 48 (1994).
     </p>
     <p>
      In Arkansas, a materialman's lien arises by statute on the date construction begins; it remains inchoate until it is perfected (or expires by failure to timely perfect); and upon perfection, it relates back to the date construction began.Betty's Homes, Inc. v. Cooper Homes, Inc., 411 B.R. 626 (W.D. Ark. 2009).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where claimants in bankruptcy furnished labor and material to bankrupt prior to filing date of bankruptcy, and mechanics' liens were recorded by the claimants prior to such date, such liens were perfected prior to date of bankruptcy and were allowable claims. In re Taylor Oak Flooring Co., 87 F. Supp. 6 (W.D. Ark. 1949).
     </p>
     <p>
      Property owner asserting defense of estoppel to suit to foreclose lien has the burden of proof to establish defense. Kennemore v. Robbins, 223 Ark. 384, 266 S.W.2d 64 (1954).
     </p>
     <p>
      In a suit for a materialman's lien, where the defendant claims an estoppel the burden of proving estoppel is on the person asserting it by a preponderance of the evidence. Orrell v. E.C. Barton & Co., 240 Ark. 211, 398 S.W.2d 685 (1966).
     </p>
     <p>
      The findings of the trial court that the plaintiff had failed to establish that the materials in question were allegedly delivered and incorporated in the house was not against the preponderance of the evidence. Stone Mill & Lumber Co. v. Finsterwalder, 249 Ark. 363, 459 S.W.2d 117 (1970).
     </p>
     <p>
      The burden is on the materialman to show that the materials for which he claims a lien were used in the improvements on which the lien is sought. Ragsdell v. Gazaway Lumber Co., 11 Ark. App. 188, 668 S.W.2d 60 (1984).
     </p>
     <p>
      The requirement of this section was met where plaintiff had a contract with an agent of the contractor. Seyller v. Pierce & Co., 306 Ark. 474, 816 S.W.2d 577 (1991).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a trial court heard the testimony of two conflicting expert opinions and it decided that both experts were credible, it did not err when it placed the burden of proof upon contractors to show that their improvements increased the value of a property that had gone into foreclosure. Del Mack Constr., Inc. v. Owens, 82 Ark. App. 415, 118 S.W.3d 581 (2003).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Consistent rule has been to place the burden on the supplier to show that the materials for which he claims a lien were used in the improvement on which a lien was sought because the lien does not attach until the materials supplied are actually used and incorporated into the improvement; if the rule were otherwise, it would render meaningless the provision of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-110ol1b1" target="_self">18-44-110(b)(1)</a></cite> that the materialmen's lien extends only to the enhancement of the value of the improvement for which the materials were used. Del Mack Constr., Inc. v. Owens, 82 Ark. App. 415, 118 S.W.3d 581 (2003).
     </p>
     <p>
      There can be no materialman's or laborer's lien upon an improvement for material furnished and work done upon a contract with an administrator made after the death of the intestate. Doke v. Benton County Lumber Co., 114 Ark. 1, 169 S.W. 327 (1914).
     </p>
     <p>
      A principal contractor can make no contract with the owner of land which would defeat the lien of subcontractors, laborers, and materialmen. Home Oil Co. v. Helton, 179 Ark. 132, 14 S.W.2d 549 (1929).
     </p>
     <p>
      A materialman's lien is not effective against the land, unless a contract is made with the owner or his agent. Daly v. Arkadelphia Milling Co., 126 Ark. 405, 189 S.W. 1053 (1916); Morehart v. A.B. Beeler Lumber Co., 176 Ark. 818, 4 S.W.2d 29 (1928); Hawkins v. Faubel, 182 Ark. 304, 31 S.W.2d 401 (1930).
     </p>
     <p>
      Circuit court erred in foreclosing a materialmen's lien because the lienor did not have a valid lien; while it orally contracted with a party it thought had an ownership interest in the property, it did not enter into a contract either with the owner of the property or with a person or entity that had an interest in the property at the time it supplied materials.Florida Oil Investment Group, LLC v. Goodwin & Goodwin, Inc., 2015 Ark. App. 209, 463 S.W.3d 323 (2015).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the contract is made with an agent, in order to bind the principal, it is essential that the agent have authority to make such a contract; the burden of proof is upon the parties attempting to assert the lien to show that the person with whom they contracted was the agent of the owner and that as agent, he acted within the scope of his authority when he authorized the work to be done. Daly v. Arkadelphia Milling Co., 126 Ark. 405, 189 S.W. 1053 (1916).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who sells material to a husband to be used in improving the wife's property is not entitled to a lien therefor in the absence of proof that the husband had authority to act as agent of the wife. Morehart v. A.B. Beeler Lumber Co., 176 Ark. 818, 4 S.W.2d 29 (1928).
     </p>
     <p>
      Materialmen's lien can be created if a contract is shown to exist between a materialman and a contractor representing the owner, and the necessary contract can be by express agreement or implied from the circumstances or conduct of the parties. Gillison Disct. Bldg. Materials, Inc. v. Talbot, 253 Ark. 696, 488 S.W.2d 317 (1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence did not show agency relationship between the purchaser-contractor who made improvements before acquiring title and the owner sufficient to imply a contract on the part of the owner to pay for the improvements or the materials. Young v. Mobley Constr. Co., 266 Ark. 935, 587 S.W.2d 837 (Ct. App. 1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a lease authorized the lessee to make certain improvements which were to be paid for by deducting the cost of the same from the rent, one who furnishes materials to the lessee to make the improvements will be entitled to a lien on the property for the amount thereof. Whitcomb v. Gans, 90 Ark. 469, 119 S.W. 676 (1909).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who does work on certain leased premises at the request of the lessee cannot enforce a mechanic's lien against the property where there was no agreement between the lessee and the owner that the latter should pay for the repairs. Langston v. Matthews, 117 Ark. 626, 173 S.W. 397 (1915).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where material was furnished to a purchaser of real property to make improvements on land, the deed to which was placed in escrow till the purchase money was paid, and if not paid, the deed to be returned, there was no such title in the purchaser as would enable the materialmen to secure a lien unless the purchase money were paid. Mansfield Lumber Co. v. Gravette, 177 Ark. 31, 5 S.W.2d 726 (1928).
     </p>
     <p>
      Materials furnished to construct warehouse on land owned by third party do not subject land to a lien where there was no showing they were furnished pursuant to a contract with the landowner and the evidence created no elements of estoppel against owner's paramount rights over the lienors. Arkansas Foundry Co. v. Farrell, 238 Ark. 757, 385 S.W.2d 26 (1964).
     </p>
     <p>
      Although record was void of any evidence of a contract between sellers of building materials and home owners, the evidence was sufficient as to the individual's contractor status and a contract between him and the sellers to establish a prima facie case as to asserted materialmen's liens. Gillison Disct. Bldg. Materials, Inc. v. Talbot, 253 Ark. 696, 488 S.W.2d 317 (1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where owners of house had no knowledge of secret agreement between materialman and contractor to apply payments to past-due accounts and did not have the opportunity to protect their interests, the materialman was estopped from enforcing his lien against the property. Howard Bldg. Centre v. Thornton, 282 Ark. 1, 665 S.W.2d 870 (1984).
     </p>
     <p>
      Property owner was entitled to prevail in suit by painter to foreclose lien where there was substantial evidence that painter agreed with property owner that the owner could pay full amount of contract price to contractor. Kennemore v. Robbins, 223 Ark. 384, 266 S.W.2d 64 (1954).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who contracted with the owner of a building to install air conditioning in a restaurant therein leased to a third party was entitled to a lien for his labor and material when the restaurant was destroyed by fire before completion of the installation and never rebuilt. Bell v. Carver, 245 Ark. 31, 431 S.W.2d 452 (1968).
     </p>
     <p>
      The utility contractor was awarded a materialman's lien against the owner's real property for the amount of contractor's judgment where the repairs made by the contractor inured to the benefit of the owner by improving its property. Howell v. Worth James Constr. Co., 259 Ark. 627, 535 S.W.2d 826 (1976).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where unpaid materialman did not have a fixed-sum contract for any part of the job, supplied materials to the job, and from time to time sent its laborers to the job to perform construction work but the laborers did not assign their rights to a lien, the materialman was not entitled to a lien for labor. Christy v. Nabholz Supply Co., 261 Ark. 127, 546 S.W.2d 425 (1977).
     </p>
     <p>
      Subcontractors, as materialmen, had a statutory right to seek judgment on their liens previously filed pursuant to Arkansas law and foreclosure on the general contractor's real property located in Arkansas; subsection (a) gave the subcontractors an absolute right to file such a lien and the choice-of-law provision in the contracts was meaningless because, as to real property located within Arkansas, this statute controlled over the forum-selection clause in the contract. RMP Rentals v. Metroplex, Inc., 356 Ark. 76, 146 S.W.3d 861 (2004).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Subcontractor did not acquire a mechanic's and materialman's lien on a home because neither the subcontractor nor the contractor gave the homeowner the notice required by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-115" target="_self">18-44-115</a></cite>, notwithstanding that the subcontractor provided the notice required by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-114ol1a" target="_self">18-44-114(a)</a></cite>.Bryant v. Jim Atkinson Tile, 100 Ark. App. 408, 269 S.W.3d 383 (2007).
     </p>
     <p>
      Review of the foreword to Acts 1969, No. 112 (which amended this section), shows that the legislature's purpose in changing the wording in subsection (a) to “to or upon” was to include certain contractors under the umbrella of creditor protection; there is no suggestion in this language that the legislature, by making this change, intended, in the absence of removable improvements, to give materialmen priority over all liens. BB & B Constr. Co. v. FDIC, 316 Ark. 663, 875 S.W.2d 48 (1994).
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislature, by stating “improvements upon land” rather than “improvement to land” did not intend a lien to attach to the land so improved, but confined the lien to the land “upon which the same are situated.” BB & B Constr. Co. v. FDIC, 316 Ark. 663, 875 S.W.2d 48 (1994).
     </p>
     <p>
      To entitle the materialman to a lien under this section, the material or machinery furnished must as a rule be attached to or become a part of the improvement or building upon land, or must be used in making such improvement. Meek v. Parker, 63 Ark. 367, 38 S.W. 900 (1897).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where materials are delivered at or near where the building is to be erected and the building is actually completed of materials like those furnished, this is prima facie evidence that the materials were used in its construction and the burden is on the owner to show that they were not so used. Central Lumber Co. v. Braddock Land & Granite Co., 84 Ark. 560, 105 S.W. 583 (1907); Half Moon Gin Co. v. E. C. Ribinson Lumber Co., 207 Ark. 483, 181 S.W.2d 239 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, materials furnished for a building must be actually used in it before a lien will be acquired. Central Lumber Co. v. Braddock Land & Granite Co., 84 Ark. 560, 105 S.W. 583 (1907); Half Moon Gin Co. v. E. C. Ribinson Lumber Co., 207 Ark. 483, 181 S.W.2d 239 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     In view of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-109" target="_self">18-44-109</a></cite>, there is a presumption that materials furnished to a contractor are furnished on the credit of the building. Pratt v. Nakdimen, 99 Ark. 293, 138 S.W. 974 (1911).
     </p>
     <p>
      Electric lighting fixtures installed in a building to be used as a motion picture theater were included within the section giving a person a lien upon a building for materials furnished in its construction. O'Neill v. Lyric Amusement Co., 119 Ark. 454, 178 S.W. 406 (1915).
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil tanks and fixtures furnished on a mining lease were within this section. American Tank Co. v. Continental & Commercial Trust & Sav. Bank, 3 F.2d 122 (8th Cir. 1924).
     </p>
     <p>
      Materialman can recover for the retail value of material furnished including profits. John E. Bryant & Sons Lumber Co. v. Moore, 264 Ark. 666, 573 S.W.2d 632 (1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage filed after work commences will be subordinate to any liens based on the commenced work. Dempsey v. Merchants Nat'l Bank, 292 Ark. 207, 729 S.W.2d 150 (1987).
     </p>
     <p>
      A contractor's lien does not attach until the commencement of work and inspecting and measuring the premises and driving a peg to locate the center of the house was not such a commencement of the work. Mark's Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Republic Mtg. Co., 242 Ark. 475, 414 S.W.2d 106 (1967).
     </p>
     <p>
      Preparatory work, such as grading, removal of debris, and demolition of old structures, which is not visible notice that a building is to be erected does not constitute commencement of work so as to give the lien for such work priority over a subsequently recorded construction mortgage. Clark v. GE Co., 243 Ark. 399, 420 S.W.2d 830 (1967).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section does not give a right of lien to one performing the services of surveyor or civil engineer preparatory to contemplated improvements. John E. Mahaffey & Assocs. v. Brophy, 249 Ark. 884, 462 S.W.2d 226 (1971).
     </p>
     <p>
      The claims of a contractor are subordinated to the claims of laborers and materialmen. Long v. Charles T. Abeles & Co., 77 Ark. 156, 93 S.W. 67 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where, prior to the recording of a construction money mortgage, a materialman furnished materials for construction of home, the mortgagee, by paying first materialman, did not defeat the priority of liens of materialmen who furnished materials after the recording of the mortgage, as their liens related back to commencement of construction of the home and were on an equality with that of the first materialman. Planters Lumber Co. v. Jack Collier E. Co., 234 Ark. 1091, 356 S.W.2d 631 (1962).
     </p>
     <p>
      A construction mortgage had priority over a subsequent materialmen's lien as to proceeds of the mortgage advanced for labor and materials, but not as to money retained by the mortgagee for the purchase price of the ground nor as to money paid by the disbursing agent to the mortgagee for interest. Planters Lumber Co. v. Wilson Co., 241 Ark. 1005, 413 S.W.2d 55 (1967).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there was no actual, legal, or constructive notice that bank had a mortgage on land when work commenced, materialmen had a right to rely on record and materialmen's lien had priority over mortgage. Lien on new construction by materialman related back to the time when work commenced and took priority over any claims perfected after that time. Dempsey v. Merchants Nat'l Bank, 292 Ark. 207, 729 S.W.2d 150 (1987).
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the 1969 amendment to subsection (a) of this section, the law remains that as between the lien of a mechanic or the furnisher of material and the lien of a prior mortgage, the lien of the former is superior only upon a separate building constructed on the land with the labor and material furnished, or to such an addition as is separable from the original building; as between a materialman and a prior mortgagor, “first-in-time, first in right” is the law in Arkansas unless the materialman can remove the improvements from the land. BB & B Constr. Co. v. FDIC, 316 Ark. 663, 875 S.W.2d 48 (1994).
     </p>
     <p>
      A materialman who has furnished materials for building a sidewalk has a lien therefor upon the sidewalk and the abutting lots. Leiper & Mills v. Minnig, 74 Ark. 510, 86 S.W. 407 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who, under contract with the owner of a lot, connected a building thereon with the water main by laying a pipe across the property of adjoining proprietors with their consent was entitled to a mechanic's lien for the entire pipe and the lien could be enforced against one who subsequently purchased the lot from such owner. Speer Hdwe. Co. v. Bruce Bros., 105 Ark. 146, 150 S.W. 403 (1912).
     </p>
     <p>
      A contractor's lien is limited to materials furnished or labor actually performed by him; he has no lien for profits. Cook v. Moore, 152 Ark. 590, 239 S.W. 750 (1922); Withrow v. Wright, 215 Ark. 654, 222 S.W.2d 809 (1949).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who claimed a lien against a purchaser of land for materials furnished to build a garage had no lien on the land after the vendor had retaken the property upon the purchaser's default. Judd v. Rieff, 174 Ark. 362, 295 S.W. 370 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      Property to which a sewer line is accessible though not an appurtenance is not subject to a lien for pipe furnished in the construction of the sewer line. Cabot Indus. Dev. Corp. v. Shearman Concrete Pipe Co., 239 Ark. 93, 387 S.W.2d 336 (1965).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who furnished asphalt and labor for the pavement of streets and roadways in a subdivision, under contract with the subdivider, was not entitled to a lien on the entire subdivision and it was encumbent upon him to show by evidence the location of the roadways and streets upon which he supplied labor and materials and what lots abutted upon them. Dix v. Olds, 242 Ark. 850, 415 S.W.2d 567 (1967).
     </p>
     <p>
      Materialmen's liens attached only to the land and improvements and did not attach to the unexpended proceeds of a construction mortgage, securing future advances, still unadvanced by the mortgage. House v. Scott, 244 Ark. 1075, 429 S.W.2d 108 (1968).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the contract or purchase of materials was made by previous owners and the suit was a suit in rem against the property, the only recovery that could be made by the plaintiff was under this section which grants a lien against the property for materials and labor furnished; because this section does not provide that the supplier of the materials or labor has a lien for attorney's fees, attorney's fees were not recoverable. Transportation Properties, Inc. v. Central Glass & Mirror of N.W. Ark., Inc., 38 Ark. App. 60, 827 S.W.2d 667 (1992).
     </p>
     <p>
      Lien provided by this section did not extend to profits on a cost-plus contract, but only to the costs of labor and material, and where the trial court improperly allowed the construction company the full amount of its claim, which included the builder's fee, without segregating the builder's fee or any profits, that portion of the trial court's judgment was reversed. Hickman v. Kralicek Realty & Constr. Co., 84 Ark. App. 61, 129 S.W.3d 317 (2003).
     </p>
     <p>
      Entire value of a materialman's lien for steel was properly found to attach to four barges; the barge builder failed to rebut the presumption that the barges incorporated the supplier's steel. An argument that the presumption did not apply because the steel was not solely furnished for the barge project failed because substantial evidence indicated that the supplier understood that the steel was to be used to build the barges.Falcon Steel, Inc. v. J. Russell Flowers, Inc., 635 F.3d 369 (8th Cir. 2011).
     </p>
     <p>
      Work done and materials furnished for the improvement of two separate tracts of land will not create a lien on both tracts unless the work was done and materials furnished under entire contract. Meek v. Parker, 63 Ark. 367, 38 S.W. 900 (1897).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where materials were furnished and labor performed for the construction of several buildings, each building will be liable only for the materials furnished and labor done in its construction, unless the buildings were upon the same lot or upon contiguous lots and the contract for labor and materials was entire, in which case all such lots would be jointly liable. Central Lumber Co. v. Braddock Land & Granite Co., 84 Ark. 560, 105 S.W. 583 (1907).
     </p>
     <p>
      A lien exists in favor of a materialman upon two or more lots where the materials are furnished under a single contract for buildings to be constructed upon two or more lots which are not contiguous. Burel v. East Ark. Lumber Co., 129 Ark. 58, 195 S.W. 378 (1917).
     </p>
     <p>
      To qualify as a laborer or mechanic, a person must perform manual labor either with his hands or with tools. Drawings which require skill are not the type of services contemplated by a laborer's lien. Westside Galvanizing Servs., Inc. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 724 F. Supp. 644 (W.D. Ark. 1989), aff'd, 921 F.2d 735 (8th Cir. 1990).
     </p>
     <p>
      Physical presence on a job site without more does not fall within the definition of “work or labor done.” Buckman v. Gay, 27 Ark. App. 184, 768 S.W.2d 547 (1989).

     Despite the 1969 amendment to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-101ol1a" target="_self">18-44-101(a)</a></cite>, the law remains that as between the lien of a mechanic or the furnisher of material and the lien of a prior mortgage, the lien of the former is superior only upon a separate building constructed on the land with the labor and material furnished, or to such an addition as is separable from the original building; as between a materialman and a prior mortgagor, “first-in-time, first in right” is the law in Arkansas unless the materialman can remove the improvements from the land.

      Preparatory work, such as grading, removal of debris, and demolition of existing structures, which is not visible notice that a building is about to be erected does not constitute commencement of work so as to give the lien for such work priority over a subsequently recorded construction mortgage.

     </p>

     <p>
      Trial court erred in finding that construction on a project did not commence until after the filing of the lender's mortgage by considering the parties'intent; under subdivision (a)(2) of this section, the trial court should have considered whether there was a visible manifestation of activity on the property that would show that construction had begun or would soon begin.May Constr.

     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgagee did not defeat the priority of liens of subsequent materialmen who furnished materials after the recording of the construction money mortgage by paying a materialman who furnished materials prior to the recording of the mortgage; liens of the subsequent materialmen related back to commencement of construction of the home and were on an equality with that of the first materialman. Planters Lumber Co. v. Jack Collier E. Co., 234 Ark. 1091, 356 S.W.2d 631 (1962).
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to give a lien to a mechanic or a material furnisher superior to a prior mortgage, the improvement must be separate from the original improvement, or, if connected with the original improvement, it must be so connected as to be removable without injury to the original building. Imboden v. Citizens' Bank, 163 Ark. 615, 260 S.W. 734 (1924); Fine v. Dyke Bros., 175 Ark. 672, 300 S.W. 375 (1927); Morrilton Lumber Co. v. Groom, 176 Ark. 520, 3 S.W.2d 293 (1928).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where materialman sued to foreclose statutory lien on buildings erected by bankrupt contractor, fact that party who had financed contractor had taken prior construction money mortgage did not affect the lien since mortgage did not contain requisite language showing “purpose” for which money was loaned to contractor. Jack Collier E. Co. v. E.C. Barton & Co., 228 Ark. 300, 307 S.W.2d 863 (1957).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a materialman furnished materials for construction of home prior to the recording of the construction money mortgage, the mortgagee, by paying the materialman, did not defeat the priority of liens of subsequent materialmen who furnished materials after the recording of the mortgage, as their liens related back to commencement of construction of the home and were on an equality with that of the first materialman. Planters Lumber Co. v. Jack Collier E. Co., 234 Ark. 1091, 356 S.W.2d 631 (1962).
     </p>
     <p>
      A construction mortgage had priority over a subsequent materialmen's lien as to proceeds of the mortgage advanced for labor and materials, but not as to money retained by the mortgagee for the purchase price of the ground nor as to money paid by the disbursing agent to the mortgagee for interest. Planters Lumber Co. v. Wilson Co., 241 Ark. 1005, 413 S.W.2d 55 (1967).

      Where mortgagee under recorded mortgage was obligated to make future advances for construction of tourist cabin, its lien was superior to mechanic's lien of materialmen who furnished material used in construction of cabins. Ashdown Hdwe. Co. v. Hughes, 223 Ark. 541, 267 S.W.2d 294 (1954).
     </p>
     <p>
      A mortgage that recited that the loan secured should be used to construct a dwelling house on the mortgaged premises and that the mortgage should cover and secure future advances was not a construction loan as to future advances since the mortgagee was not obligated to make future advances. Lyman Lamb Co. v. Union Bank, 237 Ark. 629, 374 S.W.2d 820 (1964).
     </p>
     <p>
      The mortgagee of a mortgage securing future advances of funds “to be used solely for and in construction of a one family residence” was not entitled to priority over materialmen's liens as to funds used to satisfy a prior existing mortgage and to pay the balance due on the purchase price of the building site. House v. Scott, 244 Ark. 1075, 429 S.W.2d 108 (1968).
     </p>
     <p>
      A materialman's lien cannot be acquired upon land, as distinguished from the building, for materials furnished in rebuilding a house thereon which was destroyed by fire as against mortgages filed prior to the furnishing of such material. Barton Lumber & Brick Co. v. Caraway, 178 Ark. 1034, 13 S.W.2d 586 (1929).
     </p>
     <p>
      A materialman's lien on a house rebuilt after being destroyed by fire is superior to a prior mortgage covering both land and improvements, and it is immaterial that the insurance money covering the destroyed house was in part used to erect the new one. Barton Lumber & Brick Co. v. Caraway, 178 Ark. 1034, 13 S.W.2d 586 (1929).
     </p>

      An unrecorded mortgage, even though executed before work upon which mechanics' liens are based was done, will not take precedence over mechanics' liens perfected according to statute. O'Neill v. Lyric Amusement Co., 119 Ark. 454, 178 S.W. 406 (1915).
     </p>
     <p>
      Even though materialman knew that mortgagee was furnishing money for construction, that knowledge would not make mortgage superior to lien of materialman where mortgage was not recorded. Jack Collier E. Co. v. E.C. Barton & Co., 228 Ark. 300, 307 S.W.2d 863 (1957).
     </p>
     <p>
      An innocent purchaser of a note secured by a mortgage given to a contractor does not have lien prior to those of subcontractors, laborers, and materialmen who subsequently furnished labor and material in making the improvement. Home Oil Co. v. Helton, 179 Ark. 132, 14 S.W.2d 549 (1929).
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasers of an interest in real estate, after the accrual of a materialman's lien thereon and within the statutory period allowed to file a lien after the materials had been furnished, are not innocent purchasers of the property but take subject to the lien. Bell v. Koontz, 172 Ark. 870, 290 S.W. 597 (1927); Owen v. Continental Supply Co., 175 Ark. 741, 300 S.W. 398 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>

        The requirement of “actual notice” at least contemplates a notice reasonably contemporaneous with the assignment of the lien and since the requirement of notice is not conditioned upon actual prejudice, there is a time beyond which the giving of notice of the assignment will not be sanctioned.

          The institution of a suit by a materialman to enforce a lien for materials furnished cures the omission to comply with this section where the suit is brought before the expiration of the statutory period within which liens may be enforced.

          Subsection (f), exempting certain licensed contractors from giving notice to owners, is unconstitutional as violative of due process and equal protection. Urrey Ceramic Tile Co. v. Mosley, 304 Ark. 711, 805 S.W.2d 54 (1991).

         </p>
         <p>
          As the construction was performed by the general contractor, a licensed contractor, who used an unlicensed contractor, the commercial construction exception still applied and the materialmen's lien was therefore enforceable and did not fail for lack of notice. Seyller v. Pierce & Co., 306 Ark. 474, 816 S.W.2d 577 (1991) (decision under prior law).

          Under the plain wording of subdivision (a)(8)(A) of this section, to the extent a homeowner had ordered materials or services directly from a contractor, those transactions constituted direct sales, and the contractor was not required to give the homeowner statutory notice as the homeowner was in direct privity of contract with the direct-sale contractor, and there were no undisclosed suppliers or laborers.Hammerhead Contr. & Dev., LLC v. Ladd, 2016 Ark. 162, 489 S.W.3d 654 (2016).

          Evidence held sufficient to find that exception to the notice requirement applied. National Lumber Co. v. Advance Dev. Corp., 293 Ark. 1, 732 S.W.2d 840 (1987).
         </p>
         <p>
          Supplier held not entitled to lien against homeowners for the value of the materials supplied where neither the supplier nor the contractor had given the homeowners the notice required under this section. Gunter Bros. Lumber Co. v. Launius, 11 Ark. App. 191, 669 S.W.2d 205 (1984).
         </p>

         </p>

         A supplier is not entitled to an engineer's lien under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-105" target="_self">18-44-105</a></cite>, where the services were not done by a licensed engineer, and where notice under this section was not given. Westside Galvanizing Servs., Inc. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 724 F. Supp. 644 (W.D. Ark. 1989), aff'd, 921 F.2d 735 (8th Cir. 1990).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where property owner did not receive prescribed notice prior to the furnishing of materials, lien was not perfected although supplier filed lawsuit within 120 days of the last delivery of materials. Westside Galvanizing Services, Inc. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 921 F.2d 735 (8th Cir. 1990).
         </p>
         <p>
          General contractor was not entitled to a lien because it failed to comply with statutory provisions to notify the owner of the commercial real estate before 75 days had elapsed from the time that the labor was supplied and the material furnished; the contractor's certified letter to the owner to transmit the lien was not timely and the purported notice failed to satisfy the requirements of this section. Cannon Remodeling & Painting, Inc. v. Mktg. Co., 79 Ark. App. 432, 90 S.W.3d 5 (2002).
         </p>
         <p>
          The notice provisions contained in the statute are to be strictly construed, thus requiring strict compliance; they cannot be satisfied by substantial compliance. Books-A-Million, Inc. v. Cockerman Constr. Co., 340 Ark. 467, 10 S.W.3d 857 (2000).
         </p>
         <p>
          <p>
         Subcontractor did not acquire a mechanic's and materialman's lien on a home because neither the subcontractor nor the contractor gave the homeowner the notice required by this section, which had to be strictly complied with, notwithstanding that the subcontractor provided the notice required by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-114ol1a" target="_self">18-44-114(a)</a></cite>.Bryant v. Jim Atkinson Tile, 100 Ark. App. 408, 269 S.W.3d 383 (2007).
         </p>
         <p>
          Lien notice did not comply with this section, because strict compliance with the notice requirements of this section was required, and the description of work done simply tracked the language of the section, and in no way actually described the labor and materials provided by the claimant; the claimant merely stated that the lien notice was being provided in connection with sums owed and unpaid for labor and materials provided in connection with the properties.Ground Zero Constr., Inc. v. Creek, 2012 Ark. 243, 410 S.W.3d 579 (2012).
         </p>
         <p>
          There is no qualifying language in this section that invalidates a mechanics'lien claim if the amount sought in a 75-day notice includes amounts for profits, which are not lienable; whether the amount stated in the notice can be proved at trial is not a requirement when determining strict compliance. The merits of whether the entire stated amount due and unpaid in the notice is lienable is an issue of proof to be decided by the trier of fact at trial, rather than through a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.Ahern Rentals, Inc. v. Salter Constr., Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 423, 439 S.W.3d 699 (2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          In a lien case, a notice provided by a supplier strictly complied with this section because it expressly provided that the lien amount being sought was for rental equipment that was provided for a particular subcontractor; this was a sufficient general description of the labor, service, or materials provided.Ahern Rentals, Inc. v. Salter Constr., Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 423, 439 S.W.3d 699 (2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Supplier of rental equipment strictly complied with the requirements in the statute by providing an amount due and unpaid, even if the initial amount in the notice was ultimately for more than it could have proven as lienable.Ahern Rentals, Inc. v. Salter Constr., Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 423, 439 S.W.3d 699 (2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Subdivision (b)(1)(B) of this section protects a subcontractor from the contractor who fails to give notice. The distinction between contractors and subcontractors in subdivision (b)(1)(B) of this section is that the contractor has a legal duty to serve the notice before the work is commenced, while the subcontractor may serve the notice.Bryant v. Cadena Contr., Inc., 100 Ark. App. 377, 269 S.W.3d 378 (2007).
         </p>
         <p>
          “Important notice to owner” under this section must be given by either a contractor or subcontractor before the work is done in order for it to be of any practical value. Therefore, a trial court erred by finding that there was a valid mechanics'lien against real property based on the fact that a subcontractor was not paid for framing since the subcontractor had not delivered the notice personally or by certified mail until after the work was completed.Bryant v. Cadena Contr., Inc., 100 Ark. App. 377, 269 S.W.3d 378 (2007).

      Where creditor floor repair company filed a verified complaint with the circuit court within 120 days of the performance of its contract with the bankruptcy debtors, it complied with this section and had a valid lien; the lien was preserved under the Bankruptcy Code, and the creditor was permitted post-petition perfection of the lien.

      Where the complaint is verified by one of the plaintiffs, and the action is brought within statutory period, there is no necessity of having a “just and true account” other than a general statement in the complaint. Wood v. King Mfg. Co., 57 Ark. 284, 21 S.W. 471 (1893). See also McFadden v. Stark, 58 Ark. 7, 22 S.W. 884 (1893) (preceding decisions under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      When suit is brought within the statutory period, there is no necessity, between the lienholder and landowner, to file any account other than the one accompanying the complaint, nor to enter any abstract of the particulars in the mechanic's lien book. Pfeiffer Stone Co. v. Brogdon, 125 Ark. 426, 188 S.W. 1187 (1916); Carr v. Hahn & Carter, 133 Ark. 401, 202 S.W. 685 (1918); Rea v. Lammers, 212 Ark. 792, 207 S.W.2d 740 (1948).

     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      A suit to establish a lien is a substantial compliance with this section, if filed against the necessary parties within the statutory period, and cures the omission to file the account with the circuit court clerk, but this relaxation of the statutory requirement applies only as between the lien claimant and the landowner, and failure to file the required statement will not be excused in the case of a mortgagee against whom a suit is not instituted within the statutory period. Wiggins v. Searcy Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 253 Ark. 407, 486 S.W.2d 900 (1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where contractor brought a timely suit against landowner to establish lien within statutory period but did not join the bank, whose mortgage was executed subsequent to the commencement of the improvement, and contractor additionally failed to file the notice required by this section and did not file any pleading asserting priority over bank's mortgage until after the statutory period had elapsed, contractor's lien was subordinate to the mortgage of the bank. Wiggins v. Searcy Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 253 Ark. 407, 486 S.W.2d 900 (1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      When computing the time within which a suit in a civil proceeding has to be filed in order to perfect and enforce a lien, this section does not provide that a certain method or procedure be used; therefore, the use of ARCP 6(a) is not excluded by ARCP 81(a). Transportation Properties, Inc. v. Central Glass & Mirror of N.W. Ark., Inc., 38 Ark. App. 60, 827 S.W.2d 667 (1992).

     </p>
     <p>
      Where a materialman commences suit within statutory period after the materials were furnished to establish a lien, he is entitled to a lien, though he fails to verify his account, since a substantial compliance is all that is required. Rust v. Kelley Bros. Lumber Co., 180 Ark. 517, 21 S.W.2d 973 (1929).
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance with this section is not sufficient to render a lien choate so as to give it priority over subsequently established federal tax lien. United States v. McGehee, 237 Ark. 698, 375 S.W.2d 365 (1964).
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Failure to file claims with the clerk of the circuit court within statutory period was fatal to the enforcement of liens for labor unless action was brought within that period. Hirsch v. Farris, 174 Ark. 1040, 298 S.W. 487 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      Claimant who did not file any lien against property in accordance with the law, though entitled to personal judgment, was not entitled to a lien on the property. McGehee Realty & Lumber Co. v. Kennedy, 200 Ark. 926, 141 S.W.2d 524 (1940).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where no lien notice was filed and no suit brought within the statutory period after completion of work, additional work which amounted to nothing more than servicing machinery and fixtures already installed, did not extend the lien period. Turner-McCoy, Inc. v. Hardy, 230 Ark. 410, 323 S.W.2d 562 (1959).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Where materialman seeking to enforce lien elected to proceed by filing suit within the statutory period provided in this section against the property owner rather than filing a proper action with the clerk within the statutory period provided in this section as required by this section, he had the statutory period provided in this section and not period provided under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-119" target="_self">18-44-119</a></cite> in which to amend his pleadings to make the proper contractor a party, inasmuch as the claimant is not entitled to the extension provided under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-119" target="_self">18-44-119</a></cite> to bring suit until he has perfected his lien by filing a proper action with the clerk.

     </p>
     <p>
      It is not necessary that a claimant file an itemized account in order to make the lien effectual. Terry v. Klein, 133 Ark. 366, 201 S.W. 801 (1918).
     </p>
     <p>
      An affidavit made by claimant's bookkeeper is sufficient. Georgia State Sav. Ass'n v. Marrs, 178 Ark. 18, 9 S.W.2d 785 (1928).
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing requires a materialman to file an itemized account of the demand due; there is substantial compliance if the total is provided and the invoices introduced in evidence at trial. John E. Bryant & Sons Lumber Co. v. Moore, 264 Ark. 666, 573 S.W.2d 632 (1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      The claim for a lien filed must describe some particular tract or acre of land on which the building is situated, or the particular building or buildings upon which it is sought to establish a lien. Arkmo Lumber Co. v. Cantrell, 159 Ark. 445, 252 S.W. 901 (1923).
     </p>
     <p>
      Incorrect description did not invalidate the lien, since it was not misleading. Ferguson Lumber Co. v. Scriber, 162 Ark. 349, 258 S.W. 353 (1924).
     </p>
     <p>
      A verified claim and account is sufficient if it describes the premises so that a person of ordinary understanding can identify them and the structure into which the materials were placed can be found and identified. Brown v. Turnage Hdwe. Co., 181 Ark. 606, 26 S.W.2d 1114 (1930).
     </p>
     <p>
      Affidavits for a materialman's lien describing the property as a building situated on a certain block were sufficient. Geisreiter v. Standard Lumber Co., 187 Ark. 893, 63 S.W.2d 347 (1933).
     </p>
     <p>
      It is sufficient, if property to be charged is described with sufficient certainty so that land can be reasonably identified. In re Taylor Oak Flooring Co., 87 F. Supp. 6 (W.D. Ark. 1949).
     </p>
     <p>
      Holders of mechanics' liens were held to have preferred claims in bankruptcy, where statements of liens recorded designated property to be charged as property of the bankrupt, though descriptions of lot numbers were not included in the statements, as property of bankrupt was located in one section of the town known to everyone in the town. In re Taylor Oak Flooring Co., 87 F. Supp. 6 (W.D. Ark. 1949).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where description filed with account did not properly describe the land intended to be affected, a lien is not perfected. Speights v. Arkansas Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 239 Ark. 587, 393 S.W.2d 228 (1965).
     </p>
     <p>
      The description need not be in any particular form; the essential requirement is that the land or building be designated in such language as will afford information concerning the situation of the property to be charged with the lien. Arkhola Sand & Gravel Co. v. Hutchinson, 291 Ark. 570, 726 S.W.2d 674 (1987).
     </p>
     <p>
      Extrinsic evidence may be used to show that the description is adequate. Arkhola Sand & Gravel Co. v. Hutchinson, 291 Ark. 570, 726 S.W.2d 674 (1987).
     </p>
     <p>
      Description of property held insufficient. Arkhola Sand & Gravel Co. v. Hutchinson, 291 Ark. 570, 726 S.W.2d 674 (1987).
     </p>
     <p>
      The property description must be sufficient to enable anyone familiar with the locality to identify the premises intended to be described with reasonable certainty, to the exclusion of others. Westside Galvanizing Servs., Inc. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 724 F. Supp. 644 (W.D. Ark. 1989), aff'd, 921 F.2d 735 (8th Cir. 1990).
     </p>
     <p>
      Description was sufficient to enable a person with a reasonable amount of extrinsic evidence to locate the improvement in question, where description directed reader to mailbox located within eyesight of improvement, which layperson would be able to locate more easily and with less reference to extrinsic evidence than if the correct legal description were used, improvement was largest metal building in the locality, was the only property owned by the debtor in that area, and the only piece of property which reasonably answered the description provided. In re Horton Vaults, Inc., 109 B.R. 356 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1989).
     </p>
     <p>
      There are two exceptions to this section, one, where the items were furnished under a definite contract between the parties, and the other where the items were furnished under a “running” or open account without a specific contract, but under a reasonable assumption that further material would be furnished. Streuli v. Wallin-Dickey & Rich Lumber Co., 227 Ark. 885, 302 S.W.2d 522 (1957).
     </p>
     <p>
      The fact that material furnished during the required statutory period preceding the filing of the lien was not used in constructing the defendant's home did not preclude the enforcement of a materialman's lien for the entire account where all the material was furnished under a continuous account and was used to improve the land. McCann v. Dyke, 187 Ark. 507, 60 S.W.2d 918 (1933).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there was no evidence to show that improvements made several months later than original ones were contemplated at the time of the original purchases, the materialman filing his lien within the statutory period after the last purchase obtained a lien only for that purchase, not for the previous purchases. Streuli v. Wallin-Dickey & Rich Lumber Co., 227 Ark. 885, 302 S.W.2d 522 (1957).

      Where a construction company filed an action to enforce a mechanic's lien against the landowner and the general contractor on the 114th day after the completion of the construction company's work, but the construction company did not join the subcontractor as a party defendant until the 123rd day, and the construction company admitted that its contract of employment was only with the subcontractor, the trial court properly dismissed the action for failure to join a necessary party, the subcontractor, within the time allowed. Cline v. B.G. Coney Co., 289 Ark. 417, 711 S.W.2d 815 (1986).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the notice of a claim against real estate was given in the county where the property was located but the claim itself was filed in a different county, such filing was not in compliance with this section and the land could not be sold to satisfy the claim.

     </p>
     <p>

      Complaint for materialman's lien which alleged that the last item had been furnished within statutory period before claim was filed was sufficient to state a cause of action. Phelps-Powell Bldg. Supply Co. v. Silver Dollar Homes, Inc., 241 Ark. 425, 407 S.W.2d 925 (1966).
     </p>
     <p>
      When lien was filed, it related back to the time of supplying the machinery, and was superior to intervening encumbrances. White v. Chaffin, 32 Ark. 59 (1877) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      Workman's mechanic's lien filed in time would be superior to intervening encumbrances and conveyances since the filing of the lien relates back to the time of the work. Franks v. Wood, 217 Ark. 10, 228 S.W.2d 480 (1950).
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgagee did not defeat the priority of liens of subsequent materialmen who furnished materials after the recording of the construction money mortgage by paying materialman who furnished materials prior to the recording of the mortgage, since the liens of the subsequent materialmen related back to commencement of construction of the home and were on an equality with that of the first materialman. Planters Lumber Co. v. Jack Collier E. Co., 234 Ark. 1091, 356 S.W.2d 631 (1962).
     </p>
     <p>
      A lien relates back to the commencement of the construction when the lienor's account is filed with the circuit clerk as required by this section, but the filing of the account is essential to the perfection of the lien and its continued existence after the expiration of the statutory period allowed for filing, and in the absence of substantial compliance with this section the lien would become void and unenforceable when the statutory period for filing the lien expires. Wiggins v. Searcy Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 253 Ark. 407, 486 S.W.2d 900 (1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      When the materialman claiming a lien files his account with the circuit clerk, his lien dates back to the commencement of the building and is superior to any lien on the property that may have been placed there subsequent to the commencement of the building, and in order for a construction money mortgage to have priority, it must have been executed before the commencement of the building. Bank of Cave City v. Hill, 266 Ark. 727, 587 S.W.2d 833 (1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      A suit under the materialman's lien law must be based upon an account properly filed in the circuit clerk's office and be brought to enforce the lien established by that filing; such a suit relates back to the furnishing of the material. Lowe's of Ark., Inc. v. Bush, 282 Ark. 508, 669 S.W.2d 198 (1984).
     </p>
     <p>
      Although a materialman's lien was considered to relate back to the date on which the particular material was furnished, a materials supplier that filed a materialman's lien on property after a bank had filed a foreclosure complaint and a lis pendens on the same property was subject to the lis pendens because the supplier did not obtain an interest in the property prior to the filing of the lis pendens.Nat'l Home Ctrs., Inc. v. Coleman, 373 Ark. 246, 283 S.W.3d 218 (2008).
     </p>
     <p>
      If materials were furnished under one contract, the account should have been filed within statutory period after the last item was delivered; but if they were furnished under separate contracts, the account should have been filed under each contract within the time allowed. Kizer Lumber Co. v. Mosely, 56 Ark. 544, 20 S.W. 409 (1892) (decision under prior law); American Tank Co. v. Continental & Commercial Trust & Sav. Bank, 3 F.2d 122 (8th Cir. 1924).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where items of an account on which a mechanic's lien was sought were furnished from time to time under a single contract, it was sufficient if the claim was filed within the statutory period after the last item was furnished. Hill v. Imboden, 146 Ark. 99, 225 S.W. 330 (1920); Ferguson Lumber Co. v. Scriber, 162 Ark. 349, 258 S.W. 353 (1924); Whitener v. Purifoy, 177 Ark. 39, 5 S.W.2d 724 (1928).

      Recalibration of equipment amounted to an adjustment of equipment already installed and did not extend the period for filing materialmen's lien account beyond the date of last delivery nor for work done beyond the date of actual installation. Arkansas La. Gas Co. v. Moffitt, 245 Ark. 992, 436 S.W.2d 91 (1969).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Trial court did not err in granting contractor's motion to dismiss subcontractor's action, based on a forum selection clause, and in dismissing subcontractor's unjust enrichment claim against property developer because subcontractor's lien was untimely under the 120-day time limit provided in this section and, thus, the lien was not perfected and the complaint could not have been an in rem action; further, once the contractor posted a bond pursuant to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-118" target="_self">18-44-118</a></cite>, the lien had been discharged. Servewell Plumbing, LLC v. Summit Contrs., Inc., 362 Ark. 598, 210 S.W.3d 101 (2005).

     <p>
      Materialman's lien on barges was not untimely under subdivision (a)(1) of this section, as a shipment of steel made within the 120-day period was properly found to have been furnished on the barge builder's existing credit account; the district court credited testimony showing that the final delivery was not a one-time, prepaid shipment.Falcon Steel, Inc. v.

      Circuit court erred in denying a surety's motion for directed verdict because the general contractor was not liable, and thus, the surety was not liable; the surety, by the bond, bound itself only to the performance of the acts that the general contractor had promised to perform as part of the subcontract, and because the owner did not pay the general contractor for the subcontractor's work, the general contractor, and the surety, were entitled to invoke the pay-if-paid clause as a defense.Travelers Cas. & Sur.

     18-44-118. Filing of bond in contest of lien.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    (1)In the event any person claiming a lien for labor or materials upon any property shall file such a lien within the time and in the manner required by law with the circuit clerk or other officer provided by law for the filing of such a lien, and if the owner of the property, any mortgagee or other person having an interest in the property, or any contractor, subcontractor, or other person liable for the payment of such a lien shall desire to contest the lien, then the person so desiring to contest the lien may file:
   </p>
   <p>
    With the circuit clerk or other officer with whom the lien is filed as required by law a bond with surety, to be approved by the officer in the amount of the lien claimed; or
   </p>
   <p>
    An action under subsection (f) of this section to protest the filing of the lien.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bond shall be conditioned for the payment of the amount of the lien, or so much of the lien as may be established by suit, together with interest and the costs of the action, if upon trial it shall be found that the property was subject to the lien.
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)(A)Upon the filing of the bond, if the circuit clerk or other officer before whom it is filed approves the surety, he or she shall give to the person claiming the lien, at his or her last known address, three (3) days' notice of the filing of the bond.
   </p>
   <p>
    The notice shall be in writing and served by any:
   </p>
   <p>
    Officer authorized by law to serve process in a civil action; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Form of mail addressed to the person to be served with a return receipt requested and delivery restricted to the addressee or the agent of the addressee.
   </p>
   <p>
    (A)Within the three (3) days' notice, the person claiming the lien may appear and question the sufficiency of the surety or form of the bond.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the expiration of three (3) days, if the person claiming the lien shall not have questioned the sufficiency of the bond or surety or if the circuit clerk finds the bond to be sufficient, the circuit clerk shall note the filing of the bond upon the margin of the lien record and the lien shall then be discharged and the claimant shall have recourse only against the principal and surety upon the bond.
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)If no action to enforce the lien shall be filed within the time prescribed by law for the enforcement of a lien against the surety, the bond shall be null and void.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, if any action shall be timely commenced, the surety shall be liable in like manner as the principal.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the circuit clerk shall determine that the bond tendered is insufficient, the person tendering the bond shall have twenty-four (24) hours within which to tender a sufficient bond, and unless a sufficient bond shall be so tendered, the lien shall remain in full force and effect.
   </p>
   <p>
    “NOTICE OF INTENTION TO DISCHARGE LIEN You are hereby notified that the attached complaint in the above-styled cause claims that you have not satisfied the requirements for claiming a lien upon the property described in the complaint and seeks to have the lien discharged by the court. If, within five (5) days, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, from the date of service of this notice, you have not filed in the office of the clerk of this court a written objection to the claims made against you by the plaintiff, then an order discharging the lien shall be issued immediately by the court. If you should file a written objection to the allegations of the complaint of the plaintiff within five (5) days, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, from the date of service of this notice, a hearing will be scheduled by the court to determine whether or not the lien should be discharged.”

    United States'motion to dismiss plaintiffs'claims for breach of contract and enforcement of its materialman's lien was granted in part because it had not waived its sovereign immunity, and thus, it had to be dismissed with prejudice from the action. However, dismissing the United States from the lawsuit did not necessarily result in a dismissal of plaintiff's lien claims, as plaintiff was not required to make the United States, the owner and lessor of the subject property, a party to its lawsuit in order to perfect its lien interest and recover against defendant lessees'leasehold estate under this section.Dennis Allen Constr.

      Trial court did not err in denying a construction company's request for attorney's fees as the successful party in its lien-foreclosure action against property owners as the company had a full and fair opportunity in the arbitration proceedings to litigate the issue of attorney's fees, and the fact that the company submitted its disputes to arbitration implied an agreement to be bound by the arbitrator's decision. Except in certain limited situations, a valid and final award by an arbitrator had the same effect under the rules of res judicata as the judgment of a court.Bell-Corley Constr., LLC v.

      Subsection (b) of this section did not limit recovery of attorney's fees to those owners who received notice of the intent to file a lien, who owned at the time the lien was filed, or who owned the property before the lawsuit was filed, but rather, it applied to an owner who was a prevailing party. Thus, a party who had purchased the property after the lien was filed and was a prevailing party was entitled to attorney's fees.Fla. Oil Inv. Grp., LLC v. Goodwin & Goodwin, Inc., 2016 Ark.

   It shall be unlawful for any contractor, subcontractor, or other person who has performed work or furnished materials for the improvement of any property when the work or materials may give rise to a mechanic's, laborer's, or materialman's lien under the laws of this state, this subchapter and §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-201" target="_self">18-44-201</a></cite> —<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-210" target="_self">18-44-210</a></cite> and<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-301" target="_self">18-44-301</a></cite> —<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c44s18-44-305" target="_self">18-44-305</a></cite>, or any other statute providing for a mechanic's, laborer's, or materialman's lien, or the assignee of such person, knowingly to receive payment of the contract price or any portion of it without applying the money so received toward the discharge of any liens known to the person receiving the payment, or properly record it as required by statutes, with the intent thereby to deprive the owner or person so paying the contractor or other person receiving payment of his or her funds without discharging the liens and thereby to defraud the owner or person so paying.
   </p>
   <p>
    In any prosecution under this section as against the person so receiving payment, when it shall be shown in evidence that any lien for labor or materials existed in favor of any mechanic, laborer, or materialman and that the lien has been filed within the time provided by law in the office of the circuit clerk or other officer provided by law for the filing of such liens, and that the contractor, subcontractor, or other person charged has received payment without discharging the lien to the extent of the funds received by him or her, then the fact of acceptance of the payment without having discharged the lien within ten (10) days after receipt of the payment or the receipt of notice of the existence of the lien, whichever event shall occur last, shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud on the part of the person so receiving payment.

      Foundation of right to secure a lien for labor performed or material furnished must be a contract with the owner of the land upon which the lien is sought to be enforced, and, if there does not exist such a contract, express or implied, the person claiming it must fail. Roberts v. Tice, 198 Ark. 397, 129 S.W.2d 258 (1939).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the lienholder's complaint implied but did not allege a contract and no pleadings were filed attacking the sufficiency of the complaint, it was not error to permit the lienholder to testify to the existence of a contract. Myers v. Majors, 242 Ark. 326, 413 S.W.2d 661 (1967).

      Lien of materialmen on an oil rig was not sustained since derrick and machinery were not “appurtenances”. Bennett v. Weis, 205 Ark. 198, 168 S.W.2d 379 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section which creates a materialmen's lien on an oil and gas leasehold does not create a lien on oil produced therefrom and delivered to a pipe line. Tarheel Drilling & Equip. Co. v. Valley Steel Prods. Co., 231 Ark. 510, 330 S.W.2d 717 (1960).
     </p>

      This subchapter does not give the operator of the working interest a lien on the oil produced, only on the leasehold and equipment. American Nat'l Bank v. Dux, 286 Ark. 309, 691 S.W.2d 851 (1985).
     </p>
     <p>
      The lien provided for in this section does not extend to the property of a third party when the nature of its use shows it was not to remain a part of the leased premises. Bennett v. Weis, 205 Ark. 198, 168 S.W.2d 379 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a wife was not a party to a workman's contract made by husband the mechanic's lien would not attach to the wife's interest in the real estate. Franks v. Wood, 217 Ark. 10, 228 S.W.2d 480 (1950).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where purchaser of land entered into agreement for drilling of water well thereon, and later defaulted in the purchase price, well driller would have lien under this section for labor and materials against the equitable interest of the purchaser in the premises, subject to vendor's lien for purchase price. Snodgress v. Huff, 218 Ark. 113, 234 S.W.2d 505 (1950).
     </p>
     <p>
      Person performing work on water well for purchaser of land under contract was entitled to lien only on purchaser's interest and where purchaser obtained a decree for cancellation of contract and recover of down payment, the lien extended only to that fund.

      The giving of the bond adds nothing to the obligation of the contractor but adds sureties to his obligation, and thus effectively protects those furnishing labor and materials. The legislature intended to substitute the obligation of the bond given by the contractor on public work for the security given by the statutory lien in the case of property of private individuals. Oliver Constr. Co. v. Williams, 152 Ark. 414, 238 S.W. 615 (1922); Kotchtitsky v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 161 Ark. 275, 257 S.W. 48 (1923) (preceding decisions under prior law).

      This section requires a bond only when the public authority enters into a contract to repair, alter, or erect a public building, structure, or improvement; where the city housing authority entered into a contract to purchase the public housing units after the units were constructed, a bond was not required. Rawick Mfg. Co. v. Talisman, Inc., 17 Ark. App. 202, 706 S.W.2d 194 (1986).

      A materialman who furnishes material to a materialman has no recourse against the bond for lack of privity with the prime contractor, while a materialman who supplies material to a subcontractor in privity with the contractor may recover on the bond. American States Ins. Co. v. Tri Tech, Inc., 35 Ark. App. 134, 812 S.W.2d 490 (1991).

      Trial court properly ruled in favor of a contractor and its president on a steel company's fraud claim because the company could not make out a claim of fraud for failure to obtain a payment bond under subsection (a) of this section as the company did not determine that there was not a bond until after it had provided supplies to the contractor.Alliance Steel, Inc. v.

      This section does not create a property right or any constitutional right in materialmen; therefore, even though cities failed to exact bonds from construction companies, the builder did not have a cause of action against the cities when the suppliers subsequently failed to perform, because the builder had no right to rely on this section but, instead, had a duty to check to see if the bonds had been posted. Arkhola Sand & Gravel Co. v. City of Booneville, 694 F.2d 528 (8th Cir. 1982).
     </p>
     <p>
      The burden has been placed on materialmen dealing with a contractor to check the public records to verify the fact that a bond has been obtained before selling supplies to the contractor; accordingly, where a supply company materialman failed to check the records, it could not maintain suit against the school district or its officials to recover the balance of the money owed the materialman by the contractor. Beebe School Dist. v. National Supply Co., 280 Ark. 340, 658 S.W.2d 372 (1983).

      A manufacturer which sold the material to the distributor who in turn sold material to the subcontractor was not in privity with prime contractor; therefore, surety on bond of prime contractor was not obligated to pay the manufacturer.

      Companies that supplied labor and materials to subcontractors rather than directly to the prime contractor had sufficient privity to contract to be covered by the contractor's statutory performance and payment bond since the claims had their origin in the original contract and grew out of that contract.

    Where at the commencement of the debtors' bankruptcy case, auto repairman's lien was perfected by his possession of the vehicle, the lien could not be avoided by the debtors.

      Where an injured motor vehicle passenger received insurance benefits from his father's automobile insurer, $25,000 for underinsured motorist-bodily injury coverage and $5,000 for medical benefits, such funds fell squarely within the language of this section and the hospital at which the passenger was treated was entitled to the funds.

     District court erred in applying Arkansas law as a basis for dismissing plaintiff's suit seeking relief for the alleged impairment of its hospital lien by a decedent's estate that had settled a wrongful death claim without paying the decedent's medical bills, because Arkansas's interest did not outweigh concerns about forum shopping and maintenance of interstate order that favored the application of Tennessee law to plaintiff's lien impairment claim.Shelby Cnty.

     Notice Required.
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    The practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider shall serve on the patient a written notice of his or her claim of lien and shall serve a copy of that notice on the tortfeasor or on the insurer, if there is any, or, at the discretion of the practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider, or both. He or she shall file a copy of the notice so served in the office of the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which his or her professional, nursing, hospital, or ambulance service has been, or is being, rendered. The notice shall be authenticated by an affidavit to show that the notice and copies of it have been served as required by this chapter. This notice may be served and recorded at any time while service is being rendered and at any time after the discontinuance of service so long as the claim of the practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider for compensation for service is not barred by the statute of limitations.
   </p>
   <p>
    If, to the knowledge of the practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider, the patient against whose claim or right of action it is desired to establish a lien has instituted an action in any court in Arkansas to enforce his or her claim against the tortfeasor responsible for his or her injury, or against any insurer by which he or she was insured against loss through injury due to accident or accidental means, then the practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider may, in his or her or its discretion, in lieu of, or in addition to serving notice of his or her claim and recording the notice, as authorized by subdivision (1)(A) of this section, file a notice of his or her claim, duly authenticated under oath, in the court in which the action is pending. The filing of the notice of the claim shall be notice thereof to all parties to the action, without the serving of further notice of the recording of the copy of any notice in the office of the clerk of the circuit court.

   </p>
   <p>
    The notice required by this section shall show, so far as is known to the practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider on whose behalf it is filed or served:
   </p>
   <p>
    The name and address of the tortfeasor and, if a lien is claimed against an insurer, then the name and address of that insurer;
   </p>
   <p>
    The name of the patient, his or her usual address, and his or her whereabouts when the notice is served, if elsewhere than at his or her usual address;
   </p>
   <p>
    The name and address of the person claiming the lien, and whether he or she claims as a practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider;
   </p>
   <p>
    The time when, place where, and circumstances under which the alleged fault or neglect of the tortfeasor occurred and the nature of the injury; and
   </p>
   <p>
    If the service of the practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider has been completed, the amount for which his or her lien is claimed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The notice shall be supported by an affidavit by the practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider showing that the facts stated of affiant's own knowledge are true, and that the facts stated on information and belief he or she believes to be true.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the professional, nursing, hospital, or ambulance service on which the claim of lien is based has not been completed when notice of the claim of lien is served and the amount for which a lien is claimed is not stated in the notice, then the practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider on whose behalf the notice has been served shall serve, within sixty (60) days after the termination of service, a supplementary notice on each person previously notified and file a notice in the court in which the previous notice was filed, showing the amount claimed under the lien.
   </p>
   <p>
    Method of Service of Notice. Any notice required by this chapter to be served shall be deemed to have been served:
   </p>
   <p>
    If delivered to the person on whom it is to be served or left at his or her usual place of business or residence with some person of mature years employed or dwelling there; or
   </p>
   <p>
    If delivered by registered mail at the last known address of the person to be notified, either within or without the State of Arkansas, as shown by the receipt returned by the United States Postal Service and by an affidavit by an affiant having personal knowledge of the facts, showing that the notice required by this section to be served was enclosed in the letter for which the receipt was returned, when that letter was deposited in the mail.
   </p>
   <p>
    Amendatory and Supplementary Notices. The fact that a practitioner, nurse, hospital, or ambulance service provider has filed a notice of the lien as authorized by this chapter shall not prevent his or her filing amendatory or supplementary notices of liens subsequently, but every amendatory and supplementary notice shall be served and filed in the same manner as the original notice.

        Bankruptcy court denied Chapter 13 debtors'objection to a secured claim the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) filed against their bankruptcy estate that was based on the debtors'argument that the IRS did not have a secured claim against personal property they owned because it filed a lien under 26 U.S.C.S. § 6323 in Mississippi County, Arkansas, and the debtors had moved the property to Cleburne County, Arkansas. Section 6323(f)(2)(B) eliminated the need for the IRS to file tax liens in every location to which a taxpayer might move by creating a fiction and deeming the property situated at the location where the property was located when the lien was filed, and the IRS complied with subdivision (c)(4) of this section when it filed its lien in Mississippi County because the male debtor lived in Mississippi County at the time the lien was filed.In re Chitmon, 475 B.R. 689 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2012).

        Where a promissory note was signed on March 15, 1982, with the first payment due on March 15, 1983, and where no payments were made, under the five-year statute of limitations plaintiffs were barred by law from recovering those payments that became due prior to March 13, 1986 in a foreclosure suit filed on March 13, 1991.

       <p>
        After the passage of this section, the period of limitations governing the foreclosure of mortgages and deeds of trust after the death of the mortgagor, either by suit in chancery or by proceedings under the power of sale incorporated in such instruments, was not that provided by the statute of nonclaim but the general statute of limitations applicable to the debt for which the security was given had the debtor not died. England v. Spillers, 128 Ark. 31, 193 S.W. 86 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        A mortgage is enforceable after the mortgagor's death so long as the debt is not barred, regardless of the statute of nonclaim. Burlingham v. Hutchins, 184 Ark. 764, 43 S.W.2d 362 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rights of the widow of a deceased mortgagor are subject to a mortgage existing at the time of the marriage, if foreclosure is sought before it is barred by limitations, and even if debt is barred by limitations and no foreclosure is brought, widow can assert no rights without paying debt. Harris v. Mosley, 195 Ark. 62, 111 S.W.2d 563 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one buys land upon which there is an apparent valid mortgage of record, he buys subject to the mortgage and may not thereafter plead the statute of limitations, if the mortgage is not in fact barred, though by the record it apparently expired by failure to endorse payments. Jimerson v. Reed, 202 Ark. 490, 150 S.W.2d 747 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bank which took mortgage containing warrant of title to mortgaged property against all claims except prior mortgage was estopped to plead the statute of limitations against prior mortgage when it became barred for failure to endorse credits on the margin thereof. Bank of Atkins v. Griffin, 205 Ark. 203, 168 S.W.2d 382 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of limitations applicable to open accounts could not be pleaded against a debt secured by mortgage which recited that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum. Haney v. Holt, 179 Ark. 403, 16 S.W.2d 463 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where period greater than statutory period elapsed between payments on past due mortgage note, claim of mortgagee under the mortgage was barred as to third parties. Johnson v. Lowman, 193 Ark. 8, 97 S.W.2d 86 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where payments were made and credited on the note keeping it alive beyond the time suit was instituted, debt was not barred by limitations. White v. White, 198 Ark. 740, 131 S.W.2d 4 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of taxes and insurance on mortgaged property within the period of limitation, under authority contained in the mortgage, extended statute of limitations. Bell v. McIlroy, 198 Ark. 1069, 132 S.W.2d 815 (1939); Young v. Blocker, 201 Ark. 802, 146 S.W.2d 902 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        A recorded mortgage was not barred by limitations on the face of the record where the defendant purchased the land from the mortgagor before mortgage was barred by the record and where the debt was in fact kept alive by payments though not endorsed on the record. R.S. Biggers & Co. v. Norman, 209 Ark. 514, 190 S.W.2d 984 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Endorsement of payments was not necessary where the record of the mortgage did not show that the mortgage was barred, although the debt secured would in fact be barred but for payments made upon the note secured. Hoye v. Burford, 68 Ark. 256, 57 S.W. 795 (1900) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where endorsements were made upon the record of a mortgage or deed of trust, an action for the foreclosure of the mortgage would not be barred either as against the mortgagor or any third person until the debt secured by the mortgage was barred by the statute of limitations applicable thereto, and partial payments made and endorsed on the record of the mortgage continued the lien of the mortgage as against the rights of all third parties if made and endorsed before the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. Wadley v. Ward, 99 Ark. 212, 137 S.W. 808 (1911) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
       In order to extend the statutory bar on recorded mortgage liens, as against third parties, the burden and duty are placed upon the mortgagee to enter the payments and dates thereof on the margin of the record where the mortgage is recorded but there is no duty to enter new undertakings by the mortgagor on the record in order to extend the period of limitation as to third persons. Christian Women's Bd. v. Clark, 140 Ark. 262, 215 S.W. 631 (1919). (But see §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c40s18-40-103" target="_self">18-40-103</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The presence or absence of the endorsement of credits or other payments on the back of a note is not conclusive proof that payments tolling the statute were or were not made. Schaefer v. Baker, 181 Ark. 620, 27 S.W.2d 83 (1930).

        Partial payments will keep alive a mortgage lien as between the parties and also as to third parties when the memorandum thereof is endorsed upon the record. Trent v. Johnson, 185 Ark. 288, 47 S.W.2d 12 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        As between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, it is not necessary that payments on the mortgage debt be endorsed on the record in order to stop the running of the statute of limitations. Tyson v. Mayweather, 170 Ark. 660, 281 S.W. 1 (1926); Wasson v. Beekman, 188 Ark. 895, 68 S.W.2d 93 (1934); Kansas City Life Ins. Co. v. Marsh, 196 Ark. 1121, 121 S.W.2d 81 (1938).

        Where action was barred as to prospective purchasers, it could not be revived by subsequent endorsement on the margin of the record showing a payment previously made. Johnson v. Lowman, 193 Ark. 8, 97 S.W.2d 86 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mortgagor continued to make payments on a mortgage acquired by his wife, and she made the endorsements required by this section, the mortgage was kept alive against one to whom he gave a quitclaim deed. Green v. Green, 231 Ark. 218, 329 S.W.2d 411 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure to make endorsement of payments upon a mortgage upon the margin of the record does not operate to defeat the mortgage where it has been kept alive by a subsequent written agreement. Austin v. Steele, 68 Ark. 348, 58 S.W. 352 (1900) (decision under prior law); Mullins v. Wilcox, 124 Ark. 17, 186 S.W. 290 (1916).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of failure to make marginal notations of payments on record of mortgage before the bar of limitations attaches according to the record, is, as to third parties, to reduce the instrument to the status of an unrecorded mortgage. Hamburg Bank v. Zimmerman, 196 Ark. 849, 120 S.W.2d 380 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgagor's attorneys who prior to institution of foreclosure suit received from the mortgagor a deed to an undivided one-half interest in the mortgaged land, took title free from the lien of the mortgages which had been kept alive by tax payments made by mortgagee which had not been endorsed upon the margin of the record, and attorneys' interest was not lost because, inter alia, they were not under duty to make inquiry which would have put them on notice that payment of taxes by mortgagee had kept the mortgages alive. Polster v. Langley, 201 Ark. 396, 144 S.W.2d 1063 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where foreclosure suit on mortgage was dismissed seven years after its institution and filing of lis pendens, subsequent foreclosure suit was not barred by statute of limitations as to judgment creditor of mortgagor because of failure to make marginal notation of payment on mortgage record within statutory period from filing of suit. Mitchell v. Federal Land Bank, 206 Ark. 253, 174 S.W.2d 671 (1943), superseded by statute as stated in, Croft v. Croft, 8 Ark. App. 20, 648 S.W.2d 511 (1983).

       <p>
        Endorsement held insufficient to check the operation of the statute of limitations. Clark v. Lesser, 106 Ark. 207, 153 S.W. 112 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Endorsement held sufficient to extend statute of limitations. Merchants' & Planters' Bank v. Ewan, 181 Ark. 679, 27 S.W.2d 784 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficiency of marginal endorsement upon mortgage record to comply with this section was unavailable to execution creditor if the note was not barred by the statute of limitations when the foreclosure suit of such creditor was filed. Taylor v. Magnolia Loan & Inv. Co., 194 Ark. 732, 109 S.W.2d 442 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        One owning a royalty interest in land could plead the statute of limitations as against a foreclosure of a prior mortgage where he was not a party to the foreclosure and there was no endorsement on the mortgage record extending the time of maturity of the mortgage. Arrington v. United Royalty Co., 188 Ark. 270, 65 S.W.2d 36 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “third party” as used in this section means a stranger to the mortgage. Beith v. McKenzie, 191 Ark. 353, 86 S.W.2d 176 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where second mortgage did not refer to prior mortgage, which had been duly recorded and was not barred, second mortgagee was a third party within the meaning of this section and its mortgage was subject to the prior one only as long as the lien thereof was kept alive, so that purchase by second mortgagee, at its own foreclosure sale, after the lien of the first mortgage had expired, was not subject to the first mortgage. Buckner State Bank v. Stager, 195 Ark. 1072, 115 S.W.2d 1076 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purchaser for value from grantee of purchaser under foreclosure of second mortgage was entitled to plead the statute of limitations upon proceedings to foreclose the first mortgage even though the original mortgagors did not interpose such defense. Billingsley v. Pruitt, 226 Ark. 577, 291 S.W.2d 498 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section protects only third-party purchasers for value whose rights are adversely affected by the failure of the first mortgagee to record a written instrument of payment. Bank of N.Y. v. University Partners, Ltd., 719 F. Supp. 1479 (W.D. Ark. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rationale of the “stranger to the transaction” rule is to protect a subsequent mortgagee from being adversely affected by actions of other parties of which he had no notice, not to allow a subsequent mortgagee with notice of the pre-existing mortgage and extensive involvement in the affairs of the debtor to obtain a greater interest in the mortgaged property than was contemplated. Bank of N.Y. v. University Partners, Ltd., 719 F. Supp. 1479 (W.D. Ark. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a debt secured by a mortgage was apparently barred by limitations and no payment which would stay the limitation was endorsed on the margin of the record of the mortgages, it became, as to third persons, as an unrecorded mortgage and constituted no lien upon the mortgaged property as against them, notwithstanding they had actual knowledge of the execution of the mortgage. Morgan v. Kendrick, 91 Ark. 394, 121 S.W. 278 (1909) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        A third party acquiring an interest in real estate on which there is an outstanding mortgage may invoke the benefit of this section notwithstanding he may have actual knowledge of the existence of the mortgage. Beith v. McKenzie, 191 Ark. 353, 86 S.W.2d 176 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where endorsements are not made as required by this section, the rights of third parties are not affected by payments, even though they may have actual knowledge. Johnson v. Lowman, 193 Ark. 8, 97 S.W.2d 86 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purchaser from mortgagor, his grantee, and purchaser from grantee's administratrix at sale ordered by probate court, were all third parties protected against mortgagee's successor where no notations of payment were made on the record for statutory period after maturity of note secured by the mortgage, mere knowledge of debt being insufficient to prevent the statutory bar. Hamburg Bank v. Zimmerman, 196 Ark. 849, 120 S.W.2d 380 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purchaser without actual knowledge of mortgage foreclosure suit or constructive notice since lis pendens notice had not been given, being a third party to the mortgage, took title free from the mortgage lien even though he acquired title by quitclaim deed. Shouse v. Scovill, 200 Ark. 441, 139 S.W.2d 240 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Husband of deceased vendor came within the class of third parties and it was immaterial whether he had actual knowledge of the mortgage and the payment thereon. Matthews v. Mullins, 201 Ark. 579, 145 S.W.2d 718 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where payments tolling the statute of limitations were made by mortgagor but not endorsed on margin of record, after statutory period from due date of indebtedness described in the mortgage, junior mortgage became superior even though junior mortgagee knew of prior mortgage, since it was not shown that he was other than a stranger or third person to such mortgage. Clark v. Shockley, 205 Ark. 507, 169 S.W.2d 635 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bank, which advanced additional money on first mortgage loan after knowledge that agent of mortgagor had made unrecorded payment within statutory period on prior mortgage, was entitled to recover entire amount of loan, since prior mortgage was in effect a prior unrecorded mortgage. Tucker v. Atkinson, 219 Ark. 921, 245 S.W.2d 388 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a wife joins with her husband in executing a deed of trust on land belonging to her to secure a debt of the husband, she is not a “third party.” Harper v. McGoogan, 107 Ark. 10, 154 S.W. 187 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Heirs held not “third parties.” Armstrong v. Armstrong, 181 Ark. 597, 27 S.W.2d 88 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a mortgagee brought a foreclosure suit and filed a lis pendens notice before the debt was barred, one who subsequently purchased the mortgaged land from the mortgagor was not an innocent purchaser nor a third party. Wasson v. Beekman, 188 Ark. 895, 68 S.W.2d 93 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Execution creditor purchasing at own execution sale was not a third person within this section. Citizens Bank & Trust Co. v. Garrott, 192 Ark. 599, 93 S.W.2d 319 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife of mortgagee's tenant who purchased mortgaged premises from mortgagor was not a third party within the meaning of this section. Tyler v. Niven, 194 Ark. 538, 108 S.W.2d 893 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Heirs and persons holding under voluntary conveyances are not third parties within this section. Kansas City Life Ins. Co. v. Marsh, 196 Ark. 1121, 121 S.W.2d 81 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mortgagor made payments which had effect of reviving the instrument as between himself and mortgagee's assignee, and which payments were not endorsed on record, upon mortgagor's death, his widow and heirs took the same title he had and the mortgage was binding upon them since they were not third parties. Kansas City Life Ins. Co. v. Marsh, 196 Ark. 1121, 121 S.W.2d 81 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgagor's vendor who claimed a vendor's lien though deed recited that purchase money had been paid could not contend that mortgagee's claim was barred by the statute of limitations because no entries of payment were made on the record, since he was not a third party within the meaning of this section. Blackwood v. Davidson, 198 Ark. 1055, 132 S.W.2d 799 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grantee of mortgaged premises who bought subject to the mortgage was not a third party within the meaning of this section so as to be entitled to its protection, and his widow and heirs have no better standing as third parties than he did. Henry v. Coe, 200 Ark. 44, 137 S.W.2d 897 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        A son, who had purchased mortgaged property from his father, could not avail himself of the defense in a foreclosure proceeding of the fact that no payment had been noted on the margin of the record, since he was not a third party within the meaning of this section. Denham v. Lack, 200 Ark. 455, 139 S.W.2d 243 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Son of mortgagor to whom property was transferred as trustee for benefit of mother and who managed property was not a third party within meaning of this section, hence he was bound by payments made on mortgage by stepson of mortgagor who had previously managed property. Tucker v. Atkinson, 219 Ark. 921, 245 S.W.2d 388 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decedent who received quitclaim deed to land on which there was a mortgage that was not barred, thereby taking it subject to the mortgage, was not a “third party” within this section. Green v. Green, 231 Ark. 218, 329 S.W.2d 411 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where land was sold and notes given for the purchase price and a bond for title was executed by the vendor, a trust relationship arose and the statute of limitations did not begin to run in favor of either party until there had been a determination of such relations. Williams v. Young, 71 Ark. 164, 71 S.W. 669 (1903) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section as re-enacted, so as to require the endorsement of payments upon a deed retaining a vendor's lien, was prospective in its operation so that debt was valid and subsisting for a full five years subsequent to payment made before the passage of the section, but in order for further payments to further toll the statute, memorandum thereof must be endorsed upon the record in the manner prescribed by this section. Coco v. Miller, 193 Ark. 999, 104 S.W.2d 209 (1937).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Ejectment action by vendor to recover possession because of purchaser's failure to make deferred payments was not barred by this statute where a payment on the indebtedness was made prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations before the action was filed. Williams v. Baker, 207 Ark. 731, 182 S.W.2d 753 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was passed to permit an adjustment of accounts between mortgagee and mortgagor, and remedy the former law permitting recovery in replevin suits in such cases, where any amount was due, putting the mortgagor to a further suit to adjust the accounts after his property had been taken. Neal v. Brandon, 74 Ark. 320, 85 S.W. 776 (1905).
       </p>

       <p>
        Where judgment impressed lien upon property and ordered property to be sold if judgment was not timely paid but named no commissioner and fixed no time for sale, it was an interlocutory judgment which was permissible under subsection (a), and court was required thereafter to complete the decree of sale under the provisions of subsection (b) which is mandatory, even at a subsequent term.

       <p>
        On affirmance of a decree enforcing foreclosure of a mortgage on land and rendering a personal decree against the appellant, judgment would be entered against the sureties on supersedeas bond for the amount of money, without waiting for the foreclosure decree to be enforced by sale of the property.

       </p>
       <p>
        A vendor foreclosing his lien for the purchase money is entitled to personal judgment against the purchaser in the first instance and not merely after report of the sale, and may have an ancillary remedy, such as garnishment, without waiting to exhaust his security.

      This section does not apply to a sale under a vendor's lien. Priddy & Chambers v. Smith, 106 Ark. 79, 152 S.W. 1028 (1912).
     </p>

      This section does not apply to a foreclosure of an equitable mortgage in the shape of an absolute deed. Lewis v. Muense, 136 Ark. 200, 206 S.W. 318 (1918).
     </p>
     <p>
      Though a sale of land under contract to convey the same on payment of the purchase price constitutes a reservation of the legal title merely as security for the payment of the price and though equity treats this form of transaction as having same effect as a mortgage, it is not a mortgage in the strict sense of the term and does not fall within the redemption statute. Standley v. Mason, 148 Ark. 141, 229 S.W. 3 (1921).
     </p>
     <p>
      After confirmation of a judicial sale, the possibility of redemption ceases to exist. In re Gordon, 161 B.R. 459 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1993).
     </p>
     <p>
      The right to redemption of foreclosed property within statutory period of the foreclosure was not a legal or equitable interest in property which would be included in a debtor's bankruptcy estate, and the foreclosed mortgagee could not retain possession of the property without paying the cash price of redemption. In re Pettit, 18 B.R. 816 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1982).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the corporate debtor failed to redeem the foreclosed property prior to filing a bankruptcy petition, the debtor had no legal or equitable interest in the property and such property was not bankruptcy estate property. In re Sugarloaf Props., Inc., 286 B.R. 705 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2002).
     </p>
     <p>
      Chapter 13 debtor had no legal or equitable interest in a residence to include in his bankruptcy estate, as both his equitable right of redemption and his statutory right of redemption under Arkansas law had expired prior to the date he filed his bankruptcy petition. However, debtor remained in possession of the residence at the time his petition was filed, and his mere possessory interest as a tenant at sufferance, even without any accompanying legal interest, was protected by the automatic stay.Farmers Bank & Trust Co. v. Wells (In re Wells), 536 B.R. 264 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2015).
     </p>
     <p>
      The right to redeem the property under state law is not the equivalent of curing the default; under Arkansas law, cure requires a lump-sum payment. In re Gordon, 161 B.R. 459 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1993).
     </p>
     <p>
      Independent of statute, there is in equity a right to redeem in apt time by the mortgagor or any one claiming under him. Shinn v. Barrie, 182 Ark. 366, 31 S.W.2d 540 (1930).
     </p>
     <p>
      A clause in an option contract, in effect a mortgage, making time of the essence of the contract to repurchase foreclosed property from the mortgagee, did not dispose of the equity of redemption which can be disposed of only by foreclosure, conveyance, or laches. Baugh v. Taylor, 184 Ark. 545, 42 S.W.2d 992 (1931).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a mortgagor of land died and thereafter the mortgagee foreclosed the mortgage and bought the land, it was proper to permit the mortgagor's heir, before confirmation, to redeem the land in the absence of a waiver of the right of redemption by the mortgagor. Taylor v. Shell, 102 Ark. 649, 145 S.W. 539 (1912).
     </p>
     <p>
      A junior mortgagee who was not a party to the foreclosure proceedings brought by the senior mortgagee may redeem by paying or tendering the whole mortgage debt. Smith v. Simpson, 129 Ark. 275, 195 S.W. 1067 (1917).
     </p>
     <p>
      A subsequent purchaser of an undivided interest in minerals who was not made a party to the proceedings for foreclosure of a pre-existing deed of trust was not entitled to redeem the entire property from the foreclosure sale and become subrogated to the right of the purchaser at such sale where he did not make an attempt to redeem his proportionate part of the premises and the purchaser refused to apportion the debt so as to permit redemption of the subsequent purchaser's part. Rowland v. Griffin, 179 Ark. 421, 16 S.W.2d 457 (1929).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Attempted redemption by one claiming to be a partner of the original owner amounted to an equitable assignment to the person purportedly redeeming and the redemption was invalid. Wilson v. Kitchens, 218 Ark. 845, 239 S.W.2d 270, cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">342 U.S. 897</cite>, <cite class="s_court">72 S. Ct. 232</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">96 L. Ed. 672</cite> (1951).
     </p>
     <p>
      The courts recognize the distinction between redeeming from a mortgage and the statutory right of redemption from a sale under the mortgage. In redeeming from a mortgage, it is necessary to pay what is due. Smith v. Simpson, 129 Ark. 275, 195 S.W. 1067 (1917).
     </p>
     <p>
      A purchaser at a mortgage sale is not entitled to recover from a mortgagor in possession the rents and profits during the period allowed for redemption. Deisch v. Moore, 97 Ark. 262, 133 S.W. 1035 (1911).
     </p>
     <p>
      A mortgagor who is deprived of rents and profits during term of mortgage is entitled to recover rents if he redeems the instrument. Oliver v. Deffenbaugh, 166 Ark. 118, 265 S.W. 970 (1924).
     </p>
     <p>
      Intention to waive right to redeem must be expressed in mortgage. Tate v. Dinsmore, 117 Ark. 412, 175 S.W. 528 (1915).
     </p>
     <p>
      Foreclosure decree cuts off redemption where mortgage contains waiver. Wilkinson v. James, 164 Ark. 475, 262 S.W. 319 (1924).
     </p>
     <p>
      No statutory right of redemption from mortgage foreclosure exists where mortgagor waived his right to redeem. Shinn v. Barrie, 182 Ark. 366, 31 S.W.2d 540 (1930).
     </p>
     <p>
      The right to redemption may be waived in the mortgage or deed of trust. In re Gordon, 161 B.R. 459 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1993).
     </p>
     <p>
      A waiver of the right of redemption in a mortgage contract operates as an absolute bar to a mortgagor's right to redeem within one year of sale. Dellinger v. First Nat'l Bank, 333 Ark. 460, 970 S.W.2d 223 (1998).

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Irregularities in a foreclosure proceeding under this subchapter may be grounds to set the sale aside. Matlock v. Lomas Mtg. U.S.A., Inc., 154 B.R. 721 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1993); In re Henson, 157 B.R. 867 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1993).
     </p>
     <p>
      A statutory foreclosure is subject to a judicial review. Matlock v. Lomas Mtg. U.S.A., Inc., 154 B.R. 721 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1993).
     </p>
     <p>
      Arkansas statutes governing foreclosure of property through a private sale do not specifically require that the foreclosing party produce a physical copy of the original promissory note; apart from there being no requirement that the creditor produce the original note, the creditor submitted an affidavit stating that the original note was in the creditor's possession, and given this, and the fact that the borrowers failed to create an issue of fact, the circuit court correctly granted summary judgment to the creditor on the borrowers'claim to void any interest the creditor might have in the mortgage and note.Anderson v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 683, 450 S.W.3d 251 (2014).
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankruptcy debtor was entitled to cure a mortgage default under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1322(c)(1) where the foreclosure sale was not completed before debtor's bankruptcy, even though this section deemed the sale complete upon bid acceptance which occurred prior to the debtor's bankruptcy, since a sale under bankruptcy law required an irrevocable transfer of the property through the completed foreclosure process; under state law, after bid acceptance the foreclosure trustee could reject the bid up to the time of delivery of the trustee's deed for any reason and the successful bidder's right to possession could not be enforced until the deed was recorded, and thus the sale was not complete until the trustee's deed was delivered and recorded.In re Jenkins, 422 B.R. 175 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2010).

          A sale of land under a power contained in a mortgage was void where the appraisers and the justice of the peace who appointed them lived in a different county from that in which the land was located. Raines v. Graham, 70 Ark. 490, 69 S.W. 551 (1902) (decision under prior law).

         <p>
          An unaccepted offer of a mortgagor to redeem from a sale of land under a power in a mortgage which was invalid by reason of failure to comply with statutory requirements as to appraisement of the land was not a ratification of the sale, and did not prevent the mortgagee from taking steps to procure a sale at which a valid title could be obtained. Craig v. Meriwether, 84 Ark. 298, 105 S.W. 585 (1907) (decision under prior law).
         </p>
         <p>
          <p>
         Where property had been foreclosed on and sold before the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, the debtor had no legal right or interest in the property, nor even a right of redemption; the only possible interest of the debtor, and thus of the estate, under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 541</cite>, was what has been described by courts as a “shadowy” tenancy at sufferance. Hickman v. Union Nat'l Bank, 154 B.R. 730 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1993).
         </p>
         <p>
          If a mortgagor filed a bill under the former right to redeem from a sale not made in accordance with former statute, he waived the irregularities, unless he assailed them in his bill. Dailey v. Abbott, 40 Ark. 275 (1883) (decision under prior law).
         </p>
         <p>
          A trustee's deed was invalid when it failed to show land brought two-thirds of appraised value. Meunse v. Harper, 70 Ark. 309, 67 S.W. 869 (1902) (decision under prior law).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where a mortgage, with power in a trustee to sell on default, provided that the trustee's deed should be taken as prima facie true and the trustee's deed recited a regular appraisement and sale of the land and there was no proof that a purchaser of the land had notice of irregularities in the appraisement or sale, the latter's title was upheld. Manchester v. Goeswich, 95 Ark. 582, 130 S.W. 526 (1910) (decision under prior law).
         </p>
         <p>
          A nonjudicial foreclosure sale of real property is final upon the acceptance of the highest bid when the bidder is ready, able, and in fact offering to tender the funds to the mortgagee. In re Bland, 227 B.R. 163 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1998).

         A statutory foreclosure sale conducted pursuant to §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c50s18-50-101" target="_self">18-50-101</a></cite> et seq. is complete when a trustee's or mortgagee's deed is recorded.

         Court denied bank's motion for summary judgment on its claim that a house owned by Chapter 13 debtors was not property of their bankruptcy estate because it was sold at a foreclosure sale that was conducted pursuant to this section three days before the debtors declared bankruptcy. While the bank might have been correct that the debtors lost their right of redemption under Arkansas law when the house was sold, it failed to consider the debtors'right to cure a mortgage default under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 1322</cite>, and the debtors'house was property of their estate because the trustee had the right under Ark. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c50s18-50-116" target="_self">18-50-116</a></cite> to set aside the sale and the trustee's deed was not recorded until after the debtors declared bankruptcy.In re McAdoo, No. 5:15-bk-72690, 2016 Bankr.

         <p>
          Where the bank had foreclosed on debtor's home and was active in the debtor's bankruptcy case, the neglect in failing to object to the bankruptcy plan constituted acquiescence in the debtor's possession of the home for the life of the plan. Hickman v. Union Nat'l Bank, 154 B.R. 730 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1993).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where notice of default gave as the place of sale “Sebastian County Courthouse,” which encompasses two distinct locations for the place of sale, the notice, in essence specifying two possible locations for the sale, was deficient. Henson v. Fleet Mtg. Co., 319 Ark. 491, 892 S.W.2d 250 (1995).
         </p>

          A mortgagee selling under power of sale could become a purchaser when the mortgage permitted it, and the sale was in all respects fairly and faithfully conducted. Ellenbogen v. Griffey, 55 Ark. 268, 18 S.W. 126 (1892) (decision under prior law).

      The right to redeem the property under state law is not the equivalent of curing the default; under Arkansas law, cure requires a lump-sum payment. In re Gordon, 161 B.R. 459 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 1993).

      Summary judgment was properly granted in favor of defendant bank which failed to reinstate the mortgage of plaintiff couple; it was undisputed that the couple had failed to pay the entire amount of the past-due payments, late fees, and costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, before curing the default pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

        Dismissal of owner's petition to set aside a statutory foreclosure sale of property by the bank was affirmed because an assertion that the land to be foreclosed on was primarily used for agricultural purposes was precisely the kind of claim or defense that must be raised prior to the sale or be forever barred and terminated and the owner did not raise the agricultural-lands defense until well after the auction sale.

        Company's motion for summary judgment showed it was entitled to possession of the borrowers'property, and it was then up to them to show either fraud or the failure to comply with the applicable requirements, but they failed to do so; because they did not present such proof, their other claims were forever barred.Brown v.

        After the sale, the borrowers were limited by statute to showing either fraud or the failure to comply with the applicable requirements as bases for setting aside the sale, and there was no statutory exception for setting aside a sale based on a legal or equitable claim that there had been a prior modification of the mortgage agreement.Brown v.

        Certain fees associated with the three foreclosures initiated by the creditor were not reasonable and therefore were disallowed. Because the creditor initiated the first foreclosure no later than February 27, 2009, and there was no evidence that it was the mortgagee before May 19, 2009, the first foreclosure would have been invalid under the Arkansas Statutory Foreclosure Act; the charges for the assignment of the mortgage were disallowed, as the assignment was not due to the debtors'default; and the fees charged for posting and cancellation of sale appeared to be exorbitant.In re Burrow, No. 3:09-bk-18876, 2011 Bankr.

While the bank might have been correct that the debtors lost their right of redemption under Arkansas law when the house was sold, it failed to consider the debtors'right to cure a mortgage default under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 1322</cite>, and the debtors'house was property of their estate because the trustee had the right under this section to set aside the sale and the trustee's deed was not recorded until after the debtors declared bankruptcy.In re McAdoo, No. 5:15-bk-72690, 2016 Bankr.

    Entity may be authorized to do business in Arkansas for Arkansas Statutory Foreclosure Act (SFA) purposes pursuant to either state or federal law; in appellee bank's case, National Bank Act provided such authorization, and bank could avail itself of the benefit of the SFA.JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v.

    Because Arkansas Statutory Foreclosure Act contained no express state certification requirements, court had to presume that General Assembly did not intend to include exclusive state registration it had insisted upon in other statutes.JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v.

      This section is a re-enactment of Rev. Stat., ch. 153, § 1 [repealed], in haec verba, thereby placing it back in the statutes. Sturgis v. Nunn, 203 Ark. 693, 158 S.W.2d 673 (1942).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section had no application where a tenant in common in possession cut timber on the land without the consent of his cotenants. Fitzhugh v. Norwood, 153 Ark. 412, 241 S.W. 8 (1922).

     This section providing for treble damages and not §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c32s15-32-301" target="_blank">15-32-301</a></cite> providing for double damages, would be applicable to a case where trees were injured by a chemical spray. McLouth v. General Tel. Co., 164 F. Supp. 496 (W.D. Ark. 1958).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section cannot be applied extra-territorially to an action for damages to land in Oklahoma. Widmer v. Wood, 243 Ark. 457, 420 S.W.2d 828 (1967).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where in an action against the defendants for wrongfully cutting timber from land owned by the plaintiffs, the trial court entered an order holding that the defendants could not be trespassers on the interest of their cotenants (the plaintiffs) and thus that this section did not apply, the court's ruling was not upon a separable branch of the litigation and thus an appeal was not permissible under ARAP 2(a)(2), since there had been no final or otherwise appealable order entered. Budd v. Davis, 289 Ark. 373, 711 S.W.2d 478 (1986).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Conversion does not necessarily involve damage to property, which would bring it within the reach of the statute and therefore, the Civil Justice Reform Act of 2003 (CJRA), codified at §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c55s16-55-201" target="_blank">16-55-201</a></cite> —<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c55s16-55-220" target="_blank">16-55-220</a></cite>, does not automatically apply to actions under this section; the CJRA clearly evinces an intent to alter the common law regarding joint and several liability for the causes of action listed, such as personal injury or property damage, but it does not, however, display such an intent regarding causes of action involving the conversion of property, and thus, the trial court did not err in finding the company, owner, and related individual jointly and severally liable with the business and business owner and with each other for the value of the landowner's timber.Shamlin v. Quadrangle Enters., 101 Ark. App. 164, 272 S.W.3d 128 (2008).
     </p>
     <p>
      It was proper for the jury to consider the use which might be and was made of the trees, and if the trees added to the value of the land and their destruction detracted from that value, then the difference in value was the measure of recovery even against one who, without malice, destroyed them; and if the trees were maliciously destroyed, the damages recoverable were treble that value. Laser v. Jones, 116 Ark. 206, 172 S.W. 1024 (1915).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     If timber has been unlawfully removed from land by a trespasser, the owner has two statutory remedies, for treble damages under this section and for double damages at the stump under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c32s15-32-301" target="_blank">15-32-301</a></cite>, and also the common law remedy whereby the owner may recover his property after it has been made into lumber or the value thereof. Peek v. Henderson, 208 Ark. 238, 185 S.W.2d 704 (1945).
     </p>
     <p>
      The court was justified in submitting to the jury the issue of whether or not defendant had acted in good faith when he cut timber on plaintiff's land on the evidence when there was question whether he should be subjected to treble damages as a trespasser, double damages as a person who knowingly cut the timber of another, or common law simple damages. Stair v. Jones, 223 Ark. 882, 269 S.W.2d 297 (1954).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the plaintiffs' lawsuit was for damages to timber and common law trespass, and the plaintiffs also sought punitive damages in connection with the trespass, it amounted to a double punitive recovery for the illegal act; the elements of damages were the same, and such a recovery was prohibited. Stoner v. Houston, 265 Ark. 928, 582 S.W.2d 28 (1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      Substantial evidence held to support award of compensatory damages. Arnold v. Lee, 296 Ark. 339, 756 S.W.2d 904 (1988).
     </p>
     <p>
      Replacement cost of trees destroyed in violation of this section constituted a proper measure of damages. Revels v. Knighton, 305 Ark. 109, 805 S.W.2d 649 (1991).
     </p>
     <p>
      Appellate court affirmed the judgment in favor of plaintiff for defendant's trespass and destruction of marketable timber on plaintiff's land and the award of treble damages as two witnesses testified that a bulldozer was on plaintiff's property at the direction of defendant. Jackson v. Pitts, 93 Ark. App. 466, 220 S.W.3d 265 (2005).
     </p>
     <p>
      Because both punitive damages and treble damages were not awarded against the company, owner, and related individual in the landowner's action under this section, they did not have standing to raise the issue on appeal.Shamlin v. Quadrangle Enters., 101 Ark. App. 164, 272 S.W.3d 128 (2008).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Trial court did not err in denying appellants a new trial or remittitur regarding a punitive damages award in favor of appellees, as the award was not in excess of federal due process standards, given that (1) appellees suffered economic harm, but the harm was much more than purely economic injury, as appellants cut down approximately 40 percent of appellees'future retirement homesite and the privacy afforded by the trees was very important to appellees, (2) appellants'action forced appellees to give up their plans to retire to the property and ultimately sell it, (3) the tree cutting was intentional and not an isolated incident, (4) the profit appellants received from the sale of their property was a direct result of the tree clearing on appellees'property, (5) the award was not so grossly excessive as to have violated federal due process, (6) each of appellants were on notice of and could have been charged with a Class C felony of criminal mischief under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c38s5-38-203ol1b1" target="_blank">5-38-203(b)(1)</a></cite> with, under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.05.html#t05c04s5-4-201ol1a2" target="_blank">5-4-201(a)(2)</a></cite>, a potential fine of $10,000, plus a violation of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c32s15-32-101ol1a1" target="_blank">15-32-101(a)(1)</a></cite>, (7) was a misdemeanor, with a potential fine and jail time, and (8) under subdivision (a)(1) of this section, appellants had ample notice that their actions could result in a penalty of $25,000 punitive damages.Bronakowski v. Lindhurst, 2009 Ark. App. 513, 324 S.W.3d 719 (2009).
     </p>
     <p>
      Damages awarded on the property owners'conversion claim were properly set at the value of the timber taken, which was found to be $188.95 and then trebled under this section; the only credible evidence as to the value of the timber taken was the testimony of a timber company president estimating the value at $188.95 since the owners presented only their own opinion as to the value of the trees taken.Pope v. Overton, 2011 Ark. 11, 376 S.W.3d 400 (2011).
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither double nor treble damages are recoverable in equity unless the action was originally brought in law. Augusta Cooperage Co. v. Bloch, 153 Ark. 133, 239 S.W. 760 (1922).
     </p>
     <p>
      Treble damages under this section were not allowable in federal equity court since a forfeiture or penalty will not be enforced in equity. Williamson v. Chicago Mill & Lumber Corp., 59 F.2d 918 (8th Cir. 1932).
     </p>
     <p>
      By proceeding in equity, rather than at law, plaintiffs waived the consideration of an award of treble damages under this section, as courts of equity will not aid in the enforcement of penalties. Gardner v. Robinson, 42 Ark. App. 90, 854 S.W.2d 356 (1993).
     </p>
     <p>
      Treble damages were not recoverable from one who in good faith accepted a previous survey as marking the true line, not knowing there was an error in the survey. Upton v. Wimbrow, 148 Ark. 408, 230 S.W. 277 (1921).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where removal of timber from another's land was the result of inadvertence and mistake and not a willful wrong, the landowner could recover only the value of the property when taken. Augusta Cooperage Co. v. Bloch, 153 Ark. 133, 239 S.W. 760 (1922); Sturgis v. Nunn, 203 Ark. 693, 158 S.W.2d 673 (1942).
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) is applicable in mitigation of damages under subsections (a) and (b). Sturgis v. Nunn, 203 Ark. 693, 158 S.W.2d 673 (1942).
     </p>
     <p>
      In action for treble damages under this section on account of cutting pine trees on plaintiff's land, verdict and judgment for single damages only were upheld on the ground that the timber was not knowingly, intentionally or willfully cut from plaintiff's land by defendant. Case v. Hunt, 217 Ark. 929, 234 S.W.2d 197 (1950).
     </p>
     <p>
      Government was not entitled to treble damages for cutting of timber where defendants had presented in evidence a letter from a government department indicating that the timber had been sold to a company which thereafter purportedly sold the timber to defendant. United States v. Wheeler, 161 F. Supp. 193 (W.D. Ark. 1958).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, a good faith argument is a question of fact for the jury. Arnold v. Lee, 296 Ark. 339, 756 S.W.2d 904 (1988).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where defendant, under the authority of a presumed contract, entered the plaintiff's land and cut standing timber and thereafter the presumed contract was repudiated by the plaintiff and the defendant ordered from the land, defendant was responsible to the plaintiff for treble damages for all timber cut after defendant was ordered to leave. Dickson v. Love, 149 Ark. 669, 233 S.W. 800 (1921).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where, shortly after defendant purchased land from rival claimant, plaintiff notified defendant of his title and warned him against trespass, especially the cutting of timber, defendant's cutting of timber thereafter was deliberate and willful, with full knowledge of the consequences should he fail to sustain his claim of title and he was subject to triple damages under this section. Zunamon v. Brown, 287 F. Supp. 426 (E.D. Ark. 1968), aff'd, 418 F.2d 883 (8th Cir. 1969).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where two co-defendants cut plaintiff's timber, one at the direction of a third co-defendant, and one on his own, the third co-defendant could not be held liable for treble damages for all the timber so cut, but only that cut by the co-defendant whose actions he had directed. Russell v. Pryor, 264 Ark. 45, 568 S.W.2d 918 (1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      In a proper case, either the jury or the court can treble the damages, but it is preferable for the court to do so. Arnold v. Lee, 296 Ark. 339, 756 S.W.2d 904 (1988).
     </p>
     <p>
      An award of damages, which included restoration costs, was properly trebled under this section. Shamlin v. Shuffield, 302 Ark. 164, 787 S.W.2d 687 (1990).
     </p>
     <p>
      Treble damages were properly awarded where defendant was apprised of neighboring property owner's property line claim before damages were incurred, but proceeded to have his bulldozer operator cross the line to clear property anyway. Revels v. Knighton, 305 Ark. 109, 805 S.W.2d 649 (1991).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     In claim for treble damages trial court did not err in precluding plaintiff from recovering treble damages because the two-year limitation period of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-108" target="_blank">16-56-108</a></cite> had expired. Kutait v. O'Roark, 305 Ark. 538, 809 S.W.2d 371 (1991).
     </p>
     <p>
      In an action for the wrongful cutting of trees on plaintiffs' property, an award of treble damages would have been inappropriate in the absence of plaintiffs' pleading for them or the issue being tried with the express or implied consent of the parties. Linebarger v. Owenby, 79 Ark. App. 61, 83 S.W.3d 435 (2002).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Statutory changes made in 1995 to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c11s18-11-106" target="_self">18-11-106</a></cite>, which required one who sought to claim land by adverse possession to show payment of taxes on the property, were found to not be applicable to property owners whose rights to the disputed land had vested prior to that time; thus, where a neighboring property owner was found to have deliberately trespassed onto the land and destroyed a fence, caused ruts in the grass, and drove over a vegetable garden, all in violation of a prior trial court order restricting his right to be on that land, awards of treble damages pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and attorney's fees and costs were proper. Schrader v. Schrader, 81 Ark. App. 343, 101 S.W.3d 873 (2003).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     The treble-damage remedy under subsection (a) of this section requires a showing of intentional wrongdoing while the double-damage remedy of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.20.html#t20c22s20-22-304" target="_blank">20-22-304</a></cite> requires something less than intentional misconduct; an effective defense waged in opposition to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.20.html#t20c22s20-22-304" target="_blank">20-22-304</a></cite> would be markedly different from one mounted against this section. Hackleton v. Larkan, 326 Ark. 649, 933 S.W.2d 380 (1996).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     In a trespass to timber action, a circuit court did not err in allowing the landowner's expert to testify as to the fair market value of all of the timber removed from the property, including that which was removed prior to the date the land was transferred to a trust, even though the landowner could not recover for timber removed prior to that date, because the evidence was relevant to prove defendants'wrongful conduct under Ark. R. Evid. 401 for purposes of an award of treble damages under this section, of double damages under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c32s15-32-301" target="_blank">15-32-301</a></cite>, and of punitive damages.Travis Lumber Co. v. Deichman, 2009 Ark. 299, 319 S.W.3d 239 (2009).
     </p>
     <p>
      Instruction construing section held proper. Fogel v. Butler, 96 Ark. 87, 131 S.W. 211 (1910); Case v. Hunt, 217 Ark. 929, 234 S.W.2d 197 (1950).
     </p>
     <p>
      Instruction that jury must find the timber was willfully and intentionally cut and removed and that it was not cut by mistake was not misleading to the jury, since the jury understood that cutting timber by mistake would mean the same thing as cutting with probable cause to believe a party was cutting his own land. Freeze v. Hinkle, 229 Ark. 714, 317 S.W.2d 817 (1958).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there was jury question as to whether defendant was liable for treble or single damages, it was reversible error to instruct jury that if it found for plaintiff it would award treble damages, even though court had previously quoted section on single damages. Callaway v. Perdue, 238 Ark. 652, 385 S.W.2d 4 (1964).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     In a trespass and conversion of timber action, the trial court did not err in wording two interrogatories to the jury regarding a timber company's knowledge of a forged timber deed and whether the company removed the timber with probable cause to believe that it owned the timber, because these interrogatories followed the language of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.15.html#t15c32s15-32-301" target="_blank">15-32-301</a></cite>, which authorized double damages if the timber cutting was “knowing,” and this section, which provided for single damages only if the timber company had probable cause to believe that the timber was its own.Travis Lumber Co. v. Deichman, 2009 Ark. 299, 319 S.W.3d 239 (2009).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Estate administrator's amended complaint for the wrongful conversion of timber, brought on behalf of the estate, was time-barred under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-105ol14" target="_blank">16-56-105(4)</a></cite> and (6), the three-year statute of limitations for trespass and conversion, and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-108" target="_blank">16-56-108</a></cite>, the two-year statute of limitations applicable to penal statutes where the penalty goes to the person suing, which included claims brought pursuant to this section. It was also barred because the administrator failed to meet the bond requirement of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.28.html#t28c42s28-42-103" target="_blank">28-42-103</a></cite>.Travis Lumber Co. v. Deichman, 2009 Ark. 299, 319 S.W.3d 239 (2009).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where timber purchasers did not know the boundary lines of a tract of land, did not have the land surveyed, and relied on an employee to determine the lines, the evidence warranted a finding that the purchaser committed willful trespass where it was shown that the employee, without the owner's consent, cut trees on the adjoining land. Lewis v. Mays, 208 Ark. 382, 186 S.W.2d 178 (1945).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the adjacent landowner with a prescriptive easement over the plaintiff landowners' property moved dirt around on the plaintiffs' property in his effort to improve the easement road, thereby changing the topographic structure of the plaintiffs' land, the defendant's actions amounted to a trespass, but it was not the sort of trespass envisioned in this section and treble damages could not be awarded. Foran v. Molitor Ford, 279 Ark. 121, 649 S.W.2d 177 (1983).
     </p>
     <p>
      It was not error for the trial court to have granted summary judgment against an individual in a landowner's action under this section; the case the individual cited had no application to an action like this one because of the nature of the statutory action, which was not the common law action for trespass.Shamlin v. Quadrangle Enters., 101 Ark. App. 164, 272 S.W.3d 128 (2008).
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether the related individual was an independent contractor or an employee of the company was irrelevant under this section; the company was a sole proprietorship belonging to the owner and had no separate identity apart from the owner, and thus, when the individual, operating on behalf of the company, trespassed on the landowner's property, they were acting as one person and became liable as joint tortfeasors.Shamlin v. Quadrangle Enters., 101 Ark. App. 164, 272 S.W.3d 128 (2008).

      This section imposes absolute liability in cases of intentional firing of farm land except where the required notice is given and due care is exercised to prevent the spread of the fire. Swearengen v. Johns, 210 Ark. 119, 194 S.W.2d 445 (1946).

      Subsection (b) does not limit liability to adjoining landowners and it is not necessary that the damaged property abut or have a common boundary line with defendant's property to come within this section. Cecil v. Headley, 237 Ark. 400, 373 S.W.2d 136 (1963).

      In action for recovery of damages caused by fire started by defendant on his land that spread to plaintiffs' land, the fact that some of the damaged property did not join plaintiffs' property was of no consequence for it is not necessary that the property abut or have a common boundary as there was such a unity of the tracts of land that it could reasonably have been foreseen that such lands would be affected or damaged by fire started by defendant. Cecil v. Headley, 237 Ark. 400, 373 S.W.2d 136 (1963).

    In that the very object of an ejectment action under this section was to obtain possession of land from one who wrongfully held possession, a home buyer's malicious-prosecution claim and her abuse of process claim were based on the same event, the seller's recovery of possession of the house; therefore, the circuit court was correct in holding that the abuse-of-process claim was barred by res judicata.Benedetto v. Justin Wooten Constr., LLC, 2009 Ark. App. 825, 372 S.W.3d 391 (2009).

     The action of ejectment may be maintained in all cases in which the plaintiff claims the possession of the premises under or by virtue of:
     <ol>
      <li id="t18c60s18-60-202ol1a1">
       An entry made with the register and receiver of the proper land office of the United States;

       When an improvement has been made by him or her on any of the public lands of the United States, whether the lands have been surveyed or not, and when any person, other than those to whom the right of action is given by subdivisions (a)(1) and (2) of this section, is in possession of the improvement.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>

     The executor or administrator of any person who has died and who in his or her lifetime made improvements on any of the public lands of the United States, whether he or she had a right of preemption to the improvements or not under the laws of the United States, or whether the lands on which the improvements may have been made have been surveyed or not, may maintain an action of ejectment for the recovery of the improvement, to the same extent and with the same restrictions as provided by subsection (a) of this section, for their testator or intestate.
     <p>
      The plaintiff in ejectment has the burden where each party claims under a deed of the state land commissioner. Winn v. Whitehouse, 96 Ark. 42, 131 S.W. 70 (1910).
     </p>
     <p>
      The circuit court had jurisdiction of an ejectment suit where it appeared that the defendant had entered the land in controversy before being sued and obtained a patent after judgment was rendered against him in the circuit court, since there was no controversy between the two claimants to the land before the United States Department of the Interior relieving the circuit court of its jurisdiction. Jimmerson v. Fordyce Lumber Co., 106 Ark. 127, 152 S.W. 1022 (1913).
     </p>
     <p>
      Ejectment may be maintained on any certificate of entry. Trulock v. Taylor, 26 Ark. 54 (1870); Surginer v. Paddock, 31 Ark. 528 (1876); Gaither v. Lawson, 31 Ark. 279 (1876); Brummett v.

      Possession is prima facie evidence of title. Jacks v. Dyer, 31 Ark. 334 (1876); Ferguson v. Peden, 33 Ark. 150 (1878).
     </p>
     <p>
      A void patent may be used to give color of title. Logan v. Jelks, 34 Ark. 547 (1879).
     </p>
     <p>
      A void certificate of homestead entry constitutes color of title. Abraham v. Hatchett, 128 Ark. 15, 193 S.W. 72 (1917).
     </p>
     <p>
      Cited: Newsome v. Williams, 27 Ark. 632 (1872); Trapnall v. Hill, 31 Ark. 345 (1876); Wells v. Rice, 34 Ark. 346 (1879); Queen of Arkansas Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 100 Ark. 9, 138 S.W. 990 (1911).
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchaser under certificate from the state may protect his rights by action of ejectment. Sorrels v. Warnock, 116 Ark. 496, 173 S.W. 417 (1915).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the state sold swamp land and issued a certificate of purchase therefor to the purchaser, before a patent was issued to the state, the certificate passed the state's equitable title to the purchaser and the state, upon issuance of the patent, became a naked trustee of the legal title. Hibben v. Malone, 85 Ark. 584, 109 S.W. 1008 (1908).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Where the parties to the action were the real parties in interest, and where the lands claimed have to be accurately described, a verdict and judgment is as final and conclusive as in a personal action. Sturdy v. Jackaway, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 174, <cite class="l_ed">18 L. Ed. 387</cite> (1866).
     </p>
     <p>
      In an action by mortgagee, representatives of deceased mortgagor need not be made parties. Simms v. Richardson & May, 32 Ark. 304 (1877).
     </p>
     <p>
      An action may be brought by the administrator to recover possession, but nothing will be settled beyond the right of possession, and, if the title is put in issue, the heirs must be made parties. Chowning v. Stanfield, 49 Ark. 87, 4 S.W. 276 (1886).

     <p>
      Answer held insufficient. Wilson v. Murray, 188 Ark. 312, 66 S.W.2d 622 (1933).
     </p>
     <p>
      Procedure to be pursued by defendant in ejectment is by an answer and not by a motion to dismiss. Lincoln Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Smith, 205 Ark. 1023, 172 S.W.2d 241 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      Complaint in ejectment held sufficient. Driver v. Board of Dirs., 70 Ark. 358, 68 S.W. 26 (1899).
     </p>
     <p>
      When the plaintiff in an ejectment suit bases his right of recovery wholly upon the invalidity of the tax sale under which the defendant claims and alleges such invalidity in his complaint, the allegations continue to be a part of the pleadings after the answer is filed and the complaint will be held to be a substantial compliance with this section. Wolf & Bailey v. Phillips, 107 Ark. 374, 155 S.W. 924 (1913).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the plaintiffs' complaint in an action in ejectment did not set out how or by what right they claim possession of the land in controversy, the complaint would be held bad. McAlister v. Harness, 110 Ark. 293, 161 S.W. 185 (1913).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where plaintiff in suit for ejectment claimed title to property by virtue of proceedings in bankruptcy against former owner but bankruptcy orders attached to complaint did not describe property, complaint was defective. Jones v. Harris, 221 Ark. 716, 255 S.W.2d 691 (1953).
     </p>
     <p>
      An ejectment complaint which shows by reference to attached conveyances title in plaintiff's family over a period of years with nothing on file showing title to the disputed tract in defendants will be construed as pleading prior peaceful possession in plaintiff and as sufficient to force defendants to plead. Wyatt v. Griffin, 242 Ark. 562, 414 S.W.2d 377 (1967).
     </p>
     <p>
      Complaint insufficient to show proper title. Scott v. Rutherford, 243 Ark. 306, 419 S.W.2d 595 (1967).
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of statutory requirement, in an ejectment action, the rule that any specificity or other defect should be reached, at least in equity, by a motion to make the complaint definite and certain is not applicable. McKim v. McLiney, 250 Ark. 423, 465 S.W.2d 911 (1971).
     </p>
     <p>
      An equitable title coupled with the right to the legal title is a good defense in ejectment. Alexander v. Hardin, 54 Ark. 480, 16 S.W. 264 (1891).
     </p>
     <p>
      The defendant in an action of ejectment to recover land may take advantage of the fraud of the plaintiff and his grantor by answer and cross-complaint and have the action transferred to the equity docket. Neal v. Wideman, 59 Ark. 5, 26 S.W. 16 (1894).
     </p>
     <p>
      A defendant in ejectment having no title or right to possession of the land in controversy is not in a position to invoke the doctrine of estoppel or laches nor to question the bona fides of the plaintiff who holds under a perfect record title. Cooper v. Newton, 68 Ark. 150, 56 S.W. 867 (1900); Davis v. Beauchamp, 99 Ark. 404, 138 S.W. 636 (1911).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where, in ejectment, the defendant set up that the plaintiff's title was procured by fraud and asked that the cause be transferred to equity and the cloud on the defendant's title removed, it was error to refuse to make the transfer. Castle v. Hillman, 70 Ark. 157, 66 S.W. 648 (1902).
     </p>
     <p>
      Equitable defenses may be interposed. Gates v. Gray, 85 Ark. 25, 106 S.W. 947 (1907).
     </p>
     <p>
      Equitable title is not a good defense if the legal right to possession is wanting. Stricklin v. Moore, 98 Ark. 30, 135 S.W. 360 (1911); Fort Smith Whse. Co. v. Friedman-Howell & Co., 111 Ark. 15, 163 S.W. 175 (1914).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section requires the defendant in an ejectment action to affirmatively plead the defense of adverse possession. Mid-South Partitions, Inc. v. Brandon, 261 Ark. 317, 547 S.W.2d 764 (1977).
     </p>
     <p>
      A plat is not evidence of title. Pace v. Crandall, 74 Ark. 417, 86 S.W. 812 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      As the burden of proving title in himself is undertaken by one who sues in ejectment, the defendant may rely upon the weakness of the plaintiff's title. Dowdle v. Wheeler, 76 Ark. 529, 89 S.W. 1002 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the plaintiffs in an ejectment suit relied upon a deed executed by the Commissioner of State Lands and the defendant relied upon a prior deed executed by the Commissioner there is a statutory presumption in favor of each deed and the plaintiffs, to succeed, must show that they have the real title. Winn v. Whitehouse, 96 Ark. 42, 131 S.W. 70 (1910).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the answer in an action in ejectment admitted that the defendant derived his title through a mortgage from the plaintiffs' ancestor and other mesne conveyances, proof by the plaintiffs that they were the sole heirs of the deceased made a prima facie case in their favor and the burden was on the defendant to show that the ancestor had conveyed the land away or that his heirs were barred by the statute of limitations. Foster v. Elledge, 106 Ark. 342, 153 S.W. 819 (1913).
     </p>
     <p>
      The exceptions and the rulings of the court on them are parts of the record. Jacks v. Chaffin, 34 Ark. 534 (1879).
     </p>
     <p>
      A copy of an addition to a town is neither a deed nor a written evidence of title and is not a subject of exception. Pace v. Crandall, 74 Ark. 417, 86 S.W. 812 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      Exceptions need not be passed upon before trial. Winn v. Eickhoff, 139 Ark. 211, 213 S.W. 405 (1919).
     </p>
     <p>
      The exhibits need not be copied in the pleadings; only the substance need be stated. Surginer v. Paddock, 31 Ark. 528 (1876).
     </p>
     <p>
      The exhibits are parts of record, though not of the pleadings. Percifull v. Platt, 36 Ark. 456 (1880).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the plaintiffs sued in ejectment, alleging title based on a mining claim, a different cause of action and source of title based on adverse possession could not be introduced by them after the issue was joined and the cause was before the jury. White River Mining & Nav. Co. v. Langston, 76 Ark. 420, 88 S.W. 971 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a complaint in ejectment alleges title in the plaintiff's grantor by adverse possession, proof tending to show title by deed in such grantor is variant. Westmoreland v. Plant, 89 Ark. 147, 116 S.W. 188 (1909).

      Complaint for ejectment was improperly dismissed because an appellate court was unable to determine whether a trial court found that the alleged owners failed to prove a prima facie case for ejectment or whether it failed to shift the burden of proof to the occupants upon a showing of prima facie evidence.King v.

Acts 1883, No. 114, § 139, as amended, was superseded by §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c37s26-37-101" target="_blank">26-37-101</a></cite> —<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c37s26-37-105" target="_blank">26-37-105</a></cite>,<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c37s26-37-201" target="_blank">26-37-201</a></cite> —<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c37s26-37-205" target="_blank">26-37-205</a></cite> and<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c37s26-37-301" target="_blank">26-37-301</a></cite> —<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c37s26-37-303" target="_blank">26-37-303</a></cite>.

      This section does not apply to a suit to enjoin the execution of a tax deed. Hare v. Carnall, 39 Ark. 196 (1882).

      This section applies to infants and others under disability. Sims v. Camby, 53 Ark. 418, 14 S.W. 623 (1890); Sparks v. Farris, 71 Ark. 117, 71 S.W. 255 (1903).

     <p>
      This section did not apply in a case where the widow who was joint tenant with minor children in homestead suffered a forfeiture for nonpayment of taxes as a device to destroy the interests of the minor children. Rowland v. Wadly, 71 Ark. 273, 72 S.W. 994 (1903).

     <p>

     <p>
      This section is not applicable in cases other than those for the recovery of lands or the possession thereof. Reynolds v. Plants, 196 Ark. 116, 116 S.W.2d 350 (1938).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section was not applicable in favor of defendant who purchased land sold for taxes under erroneous double assessment and who had title to and possession for statutory period of adjacent tract under deed from taxpayer's father. Morgan v. Austin, 206 Ark. 235, 174 S.W.2d 562 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (c) and (d) do not apply when the tax sale is void for lack of power or authority to sell the land or a description in the tax deeds sufficient to identify the property. Before subsections (c) and (d) apply, there must be a prayer for possession by the person who has filed the quiet title action; that, in essence, makes it an ejectment action. Liggett v. Church of Nazarene, 291 Ark. 298, 724 S.W.2d 170 (1987).
     </p>
     <p>
      Pursuant to the terms of the patent, and by operation of 43 U.S.C.S. § 869-2, disputed property that was subject to a 1965 patent issued by the United States to the State of Arkansas reverted back to the United States after Arkansas lost its claim to the property by failing to timely challenge several tax deeds issued for the property, as required by this section. The disputed property could not end up in private hands because it was public land that had been conveyed to a governmental body for public use, i.e. for fish and wildlife management, which meant something more substantial than private hunting and fishing excursions.Flannigan v. Arkansas, 427 F. Supp. 2d 861 (E.D. Ark. 2006).
     </p>
     <p>
      Action by heirs of deceased owner to cancel a deed from the state based on tax sale was not an action for the recovery of lands within the provision of this section. Reynolds v. Plants, 196 Ark. 116, 116 S.W.2d 350 (1938).
     </p>
     <p>
      Suit to recover on notes for balance on purchase price of land, to have a lien declared and to foreclose, was held not an action for the recovery of land within this section. Rural Realty Co. v. Buckner, 203 Ark. 474, 158 S.W.2d 17 (1942).
     </p>
     <p>
      Intervention in suit by the state to confirm a state's title to lands for the purpose of invalidating the tax sale and canceling the deed is not a possessory action within this section. Farrell v. Sanders, 204 Ark. 1068, 166 S.W.2d 889 (1942).
     </p>
     <p>
      A bill for the redemption of lands sold for taxes, or ejectment therefor, may be dismissed if the affidavit is not first filed. Craig v. Flanagin, 21 Ark. 319 (1860); Pope v. Macon, 23 Ark. 644 (1861); Spain v. Johnson, 31 Ark. 314 (1876).
     </p>
     <p>
      The failure to file an affidavit of the tender of the taxes and interest and of the value of the improvements made is a good defense to an action of ejectment and may be presented either by motion or by plea in abatement. Craig v. Flanagin, 21 Ark. 319 (1860); Pope v. Macon, 23 Ark. 644 (1861); Haney v. Cole, 28 Ark. 299 (1873); Spain v. Johnson, 31 Ark. 314 (1876); Wycough v. Ford & Reed, 35 Ark. 500 (1880).
     </p>
     <p>
      The failure to file an affidavit is waived where no objections are made. Pettus & Glenn v. Wallace, 29 Ark. 476 (1874); Spain v. Johnson, 31 Ark. 314 (1876); Sugg v. Utley, 186 Ark. 560, 54 S.W.2d 413 (1932).
     </p>
     <p>
      The affidavit is unnecessary where the taxes were paid before the sale. Wagner v. Head, 94 Ark. 490, 127 S.W. 706 (1910).
     </p>
     <p>
      Affidavit held in sufficient compliance with this section. Wolf & Bailey v. Phillips, 116 Ark. 115, 172 S.W. 894 (1915).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where neither the notice of a tax sale of land nor the tax deed described the land sold for taxes with sufficient particularity to identify it, the owner could maintain an action to recover such land from the purchasers without complying with subsection (c). Buchanan v. Pemberton, 143 Ark. 92, 220 S.W. 660 (1920).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where complaint alleges that plaintiff is the owner and is entitled to the possession thereof, the action is for the recovery of the lands and affidavit of tender is required regardless of omission of prayer to ask for possession. Chronister v. Skidmore, 198 Ark. 261, 129 S.W.2d 608 (1939).
     </p>
     <p>
      Allegations of complaint that quorum court was not legally in session did not avoid the necessity of the affidavit of tender of taxes and betterments since there is no claim that land was not subject to taxation or that the taxes were paid. Chronister v. Skidmore, 198 Ark. 261, 129 S.W.2d 608 (1939).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a tax sale is absolutely void for lack of power to sell, the affidavit of tender required by this section is dispensed with; where the tax sale is voidable for mere irregularities of the officers conducting the sale, the rule is different. Smart v. Alexander, 201 Ark. 211, 144 S.W.2d 25 (1940).
     </p>
     <p>
      An intervention in state's suit to confirm tax title to lands to invalidate the tax sale and to cancel the state's deed to the defendant was not a possessory action within this section, therefore intervenor was not required to file the affidavits required by this section. Farrell v. Sanders, 204 Ark. 1068, 166 S.W.2d 889 (1942).
     </p>
     <p>
      Affidavit held not required where tax purchaser not in possession of land. Robinette v. Day, 210 Ark. 181, 194 S.W.2d 878 (1946).
     </p>
     <p>
      Plaintiff in ejectment suit who failed to file required affidavit was entitled on motion to take a nonsuit without prejudice. Brown v. Frazier, 223 Ark. 671, 267 S.W.2d 951 (1954).
     </p>
     <p>
      One possessed of donation certificate merely cannot invoke this statute. Woodruff v. Dickinson, 199 Ark. 663, 135 S.W.2d 667 (1940).
     </p>
     <p>
      Donation deed to holder of land under donation certificate conveyed such title as the state had when the deed was issued and grantee's possession related back to the certificate in so far as rights under this section are conferred. Terry v. Drainage Dist. No. 6, Miller County, 206 Ark. 940, 178 S.W.2d 857 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      Holder of donation certificate who occupied land adversely for more than statutory period acquired good title notwithstanding the fact that drainage district was holder of record title. Honeycutt v. Sherrill, 207 Ark. 206, 179 S.W.2d 693 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section does not afford relief against suit to foreclose prior drainage district tax liens. Miller v. Cache River Drainage Dist., 205 Ark. 618, 170 S.W.2d 371 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      Possessor's failure to pay subsequent taxes does not operate to deprive him of the benefit of this section nor to question validity of subsequent tax sale. Schuman v. Kerby, 203 Ark. 653, 158 S.W.2d 35 (1942); Sage Land & Lumber Co. v. Hickey, 222 Ark. 147, 257 S.W.2d 941 (1953).
     </p>
     <p>
      A widow having what is similar to a life estate in the homestead has the duty to pay the taxes, and cannot remain in possession and acquire a tax title adverse to the remainderman. Vesper v. Woolsey, 231 Ark. 782, 332 S.W.2d 602 (1960).
     </p>
     <p>
      Objection may be made either by motion or by answer. Pope v. Macon, 23 Ark. 644 (1861).
     </p>
     <p>
      An allegation in a complaint that the defendant has been in lawful possession of the land for statutory period is not an admission that the possession was adverse or under claim of ownership under a tax deed and therefore does not show affirmatively that the plaintiff's right of action is barred. Berg v. Johnson, 139 Ark. 243, 213 S.W. 393 (1919).
     </p>
     <p>
      Complaint held sufficient. Smart v. Alexander, 201 Ark. 211, 144 S.W.2d 25 (1940).
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonpossessory suit in equity to cancel alleged void tax sale and donation certificate could not, after decree granting the relief prayed, be converted into an action in ejectment by thereafter filing a motion for a writ of assistance and still be maintained in equity, thus depriving defendant of all rights to have compensation for his improvements made. Patterson v. McKay, 202 Ark. 241, 150 S.W.2d 196 (1941).
     </p>
     <p>
      Actual possession of the plaintiff, his ancestors, predecessors, or grantors under a deed is contemplated. Harvey v. Douglass, 73 Ark. 221, 83 S.W. 946 (1904); Towson v. Denson, 74 Ark. 302, 86 S.W. 661 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, actual possession of land taken and held continuously for statutory period under a tax deed bars an action for recovery though the sale is irregular or void for jurisdictional defects. Maywood v. Mayo, 153 Ark. 620, 241 S.W. 7 (1922).
     </p>
     <p>
      Continuous possession for statutory period is necessary to sustain title under this section. Pride v. Gist, 169 Ark. 1096, 277 S.W. 870 (1925).
     </p>
     <p>
      Actual possession during the statutory period of time must be continuous and unbroken. McMillen v. East Ark. Inv. Co., 196 Ark. 367, 117 S.W.2d 724 (1938).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where complaint to set aside tax deed was not filed until more than two years after date of deed and grantee had held possession of the lot for longer than the statutory period under his tax deed, the deed would not be set aside. Bridwell v. Davis, 206 Ark. 445, 175 S.W.2d 992 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      Actual possession of land under deed from the state for over four years before former owner intervened in suit to confirm state title alleging invalidity of tax sale to the state vested a good title as against any claim of ownership by former owner. Standard Sec. Co. v. Republic Mining & Mfg. Co., 207 Ark. 335, 180 S.W.2d 575 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where minerals were constructively severed from the soil by mineral deeds, and were non-producing, it follows that there was no possession of the minerals by anyone within the purview of this section. Davis v. Stonecipher, 218 Ark. 962, 239 S.W.2d 756 (1951).
     </p>
     <p>
      In action to quiet title by purchaser at tax sale wherein defendant counterclaimed for cancellation of tax deed, this statute of limitations could have only been invoked by one in actual possession of the land. Alsobrook v. Taylor, 254 Ark. 132, 491 S.W.2d 808 (1973).
     </p>
     <p>
      Limited warranty deeds to the farm, although invalid because of the constitutionally insufficient notice to the railroad, still constituted color of title for purposes of the two-year limitations period in subsection (a) of this section, color of title alone was not sufficient to set in motion the statute of limitations; a purchaser with color of title also had to take possession, and no claim was made that the farm opened and operated a mine on the lands or drilled for and produced oil or gas. Therefore, the two-year statute of limitations in this section did not run against the railroad.Linn FarmsTimber Ltd. P'ship v. Union Pac. R.R., No. 4:09CV00663 JLH, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51714 (E.D. Ark. May 25, 2010), aff'd, 661 F.3d 354 (8th Cir. 2011) (decided under prior version of statute).
     </p>
     <p>
      Adverse possession for statutory period by tax purchaser bars original owner. Cooper v. Lee, 59 Ark. 460, 27 S.W. 970 (1894); Woolfork v. Buckner, 60 Ark. 163, 29 S.W. 372 (1895); Finley v. Hogan, 60 Ark. 499, 30 S.W. 1045 (1895).
     </p>
     <p>
      Adverse possession for statutory period by tax purchaser bars original owner, unless there is a right to redeem. McConnell v. Swepston, 66 Ark. 141, 49 S.W. 566 (1899).
     </p>
     <p>
      A purchaser at a void tax sale who goes into possession and remains in undisturbed possession for longer than the statutory period acquires title by adverse possession. Black v. Brown, 129 Ark. 270, 195 S.W. 673 (1917).
     </p>
     <p>
      Actual adverse possession of land taken and held continuously for statutory period under a donation deed bars an action for recovery, even though sale by a collector, through which the state claims title, is void on account of jurisdictional defects. Terry v. Drainage Dist. No. 6, Miller County, 206 Ark. 940, 178 S.W.2d 857 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section is a statute of limitations and actual adverse possession under a tax deed from the Commissioner of State Lands vests a good title in the occupying holder of the donation certificate or deed, regardless of any defects in the tax sale under which the state acquired title. Honeycutt v. Sherrill, 207 Ark. 206, 179 S.W.2d 693 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      After purchaser held land adversely under donation for two years, his title became good by limitation and would not be divested out of him because he attempted to purchase from the holder of the record title. Honeycutt v. Sherrill, 207 Ark. 206, 179 S.W.2d 693 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where state's deed to mortgagor's son was in effect a redemption by mortgagor, possession of land by son was not adverse under this section. Lewis v. Fidelity Sav. & Trust Co., 207 Ark. 433, 181 S.W.2d 22 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      Title by adverse possession acquired. St. Louis Union Trust Co. v. Hillis, 207 Ark. 811, 182 S.W.2d 882 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      The fact that purchaser and his grantor, who took possession of land under the deed from the State of Arkansas, held exclusive possession of lands and exercised visible and notorious acts of ownership over same, for longer than the statutory period prior to the filing of an action by the plaintiff, was sufficient to give the purchaser title. Pitts v. Johnson, 212 Ark. 119, 205 S.W.2d 449 (1947).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who took title under a void tax sale, and claimed adverse possession for more than the statutory period, was entitled to only the land which he had actually possessed. Nall v. Phillips, 213 Ark. 92, 210 S.W.2d 806 (1948).
     </p>
     <p>
      Intent to hold land adversely was not disclaimed where plaintiffs made offer to buy out defendant, if offer stated that plaintiffs were claiming title under tax deed, and were merely offering what it would take to clear title. Cook v. Langhorne, 219 Ark. 443, 242 S.W.2d 838 (1951).
     </p>
     <p>
      Tax title purchaser could not assert adverse possession as a result of the original owner's tenant having attorned to the tax title purchaser after tax sale in absence of proof that original owner had notice that tenant had attorned to such purchaser or was put on notice that the statute of limitations was running. Laney v. Monsanto Chem. Co., 233 Ark. 645, 348 S.W.2d 826 (1961).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where testimony showed no plaintiff had ever been in possession of land in question, this section applied and one holding under a state deed adversely for the statutory time had vested title regardless of a defect in the tax sale. Brown v. Masterson, 240 Ark. 880, 402 S.W.2d 666 (1966).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the record contained no evidence of notice of any kind to the heirs or their predecessor in title, the defendant's claim to title which rested wholly on a showing of adverse possession following possession by permission would fail. McDowell v. King, 266 Ark. 1005, 589 S.W.2d 594 (Ct. App. 1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section, in essence, shortens the period of limitation for the recovery of lands adversely possessed under deeds based on tax sales to two years, and two years actual adverse possession by the holder of the tax deed is required before the original owner's right to recover the land is barred. Boyd v. Meador, 10 Ark. App. 5, 660 S.W.2d 943 (1983).
     </p>
     <p>
      A suit by an infant to redeem land sold is not controlled by this section. Burgett v. McCray, 61 Ark. 456, 33 S.W. 639 (1896); Hodges v. Harkleroad, 74 Ark. 343, 85 S.W. 779 (1905); Chambers v. Burke, 194 Ark. 665, 109 S.W.2d 117 (1937).
     </p>

Smith v. MRCC Partnership, 302 Ark. 547, 792 S.W.2d 301 (1990).
     </p>
     <p>
      A decree which adjudged the title to land to be in the plaintiff without awarding the value of improvements made by the defendant was conclusive at the end of the term and could not be reopened later so as to render a decree for improvements. Brown v. Norvell, 88 Ark. 590, 115 S.W. 372 (1909); Gaither v. Campbell, 94 Ark. 329, 126 S.W. 1061 (1910).
     </p>
     <p>
      Improvements held not to be made in good faith. Graves v. Bean, 200 Ark. 863, 141 S.W.2d 50 (1940); Vernon v. McEntire, 234 Ark. 995, 356 S.W.2d 13 (1962).
     </p>

      One is not entitled to betterments for improvements unless he has acted in good faith in making improvements. Welch v. Burton, 221 Ark. 173, 252 S.W.2d 411 (1952).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, “good faith” means in honest belief and ignorance that any other person claims a better right to the land. Vernon v. McEntire, 234 Ark. 995, 356 S.W.2d 13 (1962).
     </p>
     <p>
      Occupants of land, claiming reimbursement for improvements made thereon, had the burden of proving the improvements were made in good faith. Vernon v. McEntire, 234 Ark. 995, 356 S.W.2d 13 (1962).
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of the paramount title must be actual, not constructive. Beard v. Dansby, 48 Ark. 183, 2 S.W. 701 (1886); Shepherd v. Jernigan, 51 Ark. 275, 10 S.W. 765 (1888); White v. Stokes, 67 Ark. 184, 53 S.W. 1060 (1899).
     </p>
     <p>
      Holder aware of claims of heirs to original owner held not entitled to compensation for improvements. Douglass v. Hunt, 98 Ark. 320, 136 S.W. 170 (1911); Welch v. Burton, 221 Ark. 173, 252 S.W.2d 411 (1952).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who placed improvements upon the land of another after he had been notified of the latter's ownership could not be said to have placed them in good faith and was not entitled to recover therefor. Foltz v. Alford, 102 Ark. 191, 143 S.W. 905 (1912).
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchaser by quitclaim deed of land subject to recorded deed of trust was not entitled upon foreclosure of deed of trust to recover from purchaser at the foreclosure sale the value of the improvement he put on the land. Vernon v. Lincoln Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 200 Ark. 47, 138 S.W.2d 61 (1940).
     </p>
     <p>
      One chargeable with notice as to the kind of title he holds may not make such improvements as will impair the title in fee. Graves v. Bean, 200 Ark. 863, 141 S.W.2d 50 (1940).
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of a prior title must be actual and not constructive, so that recording of prior deed does not defeat right of second purchaser of tax title to cash value of improvements. Topham v. Hodges, 215 Ark. 407, 221 S.W.2d 27 (1949).
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Improvements made with the knowledge that another is claiming interest in the property cannot be characterized as improvements made under a bona fide belief of ownership as required by this section.

     </p>
     <p>
      Where all the improvements made by wife were made after she had notice that she merely had possession of the property until further orders of the court providing for a sale of the marital home, and that the husband had an interest in the property, the Betterment Act did not apply. Jones v. Jones, 22 Ark. App. 179, 737 S.W.2d 654 (1987).
     </p>

      <p>
     Arkansas Betterment Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-213" target="_self">18-60-213</a></cite>, was inapplicable to a property buyer's claim against a judgment creditor bank; although the buyer made substantial improvements to the property after buying it from the judgment debtors, the buyer took title subject to the lien of the judgment creditor bank's judgment.Canady v. Petit Jean State Bank, 2015 Ark. App. 313, 463 S.W.3d 328 (2015).
     </p>
     <p>
      Life tenant cannot recover from remainderman for repairs, since it is the duty of the life tenant to keep property in repair. Frazier v. Hanes, 220 Ark. 765, 249 S.W.2d 842 (1952).
     </p>
     <p>
      A life tenant was not entitled to an award under the statutes for improvements made to the land since (1) she testified that, at the time she moved to the property at issue, she knew that she and her husband only had a right to live on the property for the life of her husband and son, and (2) she had no basis for a good-faith belief that she held the property under color of title at the time the improvements were made as her name was not on the deed granting the life estate. Acord v. Acord, 70 Ark. App. 409, 19 S.W.3d 644 (2000).
     </p>
     <p>
      A grantee who made improvements upon real estate was not entitled to reimbursement for the cost of such improvements upon the exercise by the grantor of an option contained in the deed to repurchase the real estate for the original consideration recited in the deed. Berry v. Bierman, 248 Ark. 440, 451 S.W.2d 867 (1970).
     </p>
     <p>
      Plaintiff who has not paid judgment for improvements cannot recover possession even after expiration of time for enforcing lien. Douglass v. Sharp, 64 Ark. 645, 44 S.W. 221 (1898).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where improvement assessments are distributed over a period of years, a ratable and equitable distribution of the burden requires the life tenant to discharge the annual assessments during each year of his occupancy. Crowell v. Seelbinder, 185 Ark. 769, 49 S.W.2d 389 (1932).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where part owners of land sold at a partition sale had made improvements to the land, the value of the improvements was entitled to priority in the proceeds following the deduction of court costs and awarded attorney's fees. Crouch v. Crouch, 251 Ark. 1047, 476 S.W.2d 248 (1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      Minors and insane persons are entitled to recover land sold at a void judicial sale notwithstanding the lapse of time subject only to the purchaser's right to betterments. Cowling v. Nelson, 76 Ark. 146, 88 S.W. 913 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      The infancy of the plaintiff does not defeat betterments. Beard v. Dansby, 48 Ark. 183, 2 S.W. 701 (1886).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where purchaser of land at administrator's sale acted in good faith and acquired and held possession believing that he had the right to do so, he was a bona fide occupant of the land entitled to recover the value of the improvements made and taxes paid by him on the land and liable only for mesne profits which accrued within three years next before the commencement of the suit in which they may be claimed. Brown v. Nelms, 86 Ark. 368, 112 S.W. 373 (1908).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who purchases lands at a judicial sale based upon a decree which was subsequently reversed may be entitled to recover the value of improvements placed upon the land before the appeal was taken if he purchased in good faith and held possession without actual notice that his title was assailed by one claiming a better title. McDonald v. Rankin, 92 Ark. 173, 122 S.W. 88 (1909).
     </p>
     <p>
      In a case that set aside a foreclosure decree due to improper service on the property owner, the foreclosure sale purchaser's judgment against the foreclosure mortgagee for the costs of the improvements to the property was set aside and judgment was entered against the property owner under subsection (a) of this section for the value of the improvements, where the purchaser had made improvements to the property while believing she was the true owner and under color of title.MidFirst Bank v. Sumpter, 2016 Ark. App. 552, 508 S.W.3d 69 (2016).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Remedy provided by the Betterment Act, §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-213" target="_self">18-60-213</a></cite>, is against the true owner of the property.MidFirst Bank v. Sumpter, 2016 Ark. App. 552, 508 S.W.3d 69 (2016).
     </p>
     <p>
      Circuit court erred in awarding a judgment for indemnification in favor of the property owner for Betterment Act damages against the foreclosure mortgagee. The owner had received an increase in value to her property from the improvements made by the foreclosure sale purchaser; and the Betterment Act is not based on contract, consent, or negligence but is a rule for administering justice.MidFirst Bank v. Sumpter, 2016 Ark. App. 552, 508 S.W.3d 69 (2016).
     </p>
     <p>
      In ejectment case, where no demand was made for rents and profits, it was held that defendants, who took possession under void tax sale, were not entitled to recover the value of their improvements. Buswell v. Hadfield, 202 Ark. 200, 149 S.W.2d 555 (1941).
     </p>
     <p>
      Part owner could not be given lien upon proceeds of partition sale until it was established that the value of his improvements exceeded the rents and profits realized from the land by him. Crouch v. Crouch, 245 Ark. 67, 431 S.W.2d 261 (1968).
     </p>
     <p>
      The owners of a fractional interest in land were entitled to have their portion of the accumulated rents and profits collected by the owner of the other fractional interest set off against the value of improvements made by such part owner in the belief that he owned the entire fee. Crouch v. Crouch, 245 Ark. 67, 431 S.W.2d 261 (1968).
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the permissive plain language of subsection (e) of this section, the Arkansas Supreme Court has construed the Betterment Act as not providing for recovery of the value of improvements unless the improvements exceed the rents and profits due the owner.MidFirst Bank v. Sumpter, 2016 Ark. App. 552, 508 S.W.3d 69 (2016).
     </p>
     <p>
      In a case that set aside a foreclosure decree due to improper service on the property owner, the circuit court erred in calculating the foreclosure sale purchaser's recovery under the Betterment Act by failing to apply a setoff rate, pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, for the rents the foreclosure sale purchaser received.MidFirst Bank v. Sumpter, 2016 Ark. App. 552, 508 S.W.3d 69 (2016).
     </p>
     <p>
      A tenant in common has the right to make improvements on the land without the consent of his cotenants; and, although he has no lien on the land for the value of his improvements, he will be indemnified for them, in a proceeding in equity to partition the land between himself and cotenants, either by having the part upon which the improvements are located allotted to him or by having compensation for them, if thrown into the common mass, because tenants in common might be improved out of their property; however, the cotenant can only receive the enhancement value of the improvement to the property. Graham v. Inlow, 302 Ark. 414, 790 S.W.2d 428 (1990).

      Bankruptcy court found that the debtor's sublease was terminated by the creditor sublessor by service of a notice to quit almost five months before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. Thus, the sublease was not part of the debtor's bankruptcy estate and the creditor was granted relief from the automatic stay to pursue the creditor's unlawful detainer action.

     18-60-213. Recovery for improvements and taxes paid on land of another.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    If any person believing himself or herself to be the owner, either in law or equity, under color of title has peaceably improved, or shall peaceably improve, any land which upon judicial investigation shall be decided to belong to another, the value of the improvement made as stated and the amount of all taxes which may have been paid on the land by the person, and those under whom he or she claims, shall be paid by the successful party to the occupant, or the person under whom, or from whom, he or she entered and holds, before the court rendering judgment in the proceedings shall cause possession to be delivered to the successful party.
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)The court or jury trying the cause shall assess the value of the improvements in the same action in which the title to the lands is adjudicated.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the trial, the damages sustained by the owner of the lands from waste and any mesne profits as may be allowed by law shall also be assessed.
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)If the value of the improvements made by the occupant and the taxes paid as stated in subsection (a) of this section shall exceed the amount of the damages and mesne profits combined, the court shall enter an order as a part of the final judgment providing that no writ shall issue for the possession of the lands in favor of the successful party until payment has been made to the occupant of the balance due him or her for the improvements and the taxes paid.
   </p>
   <p>
    This amount shall be a lien on the lands, which may be enforced by equitable proceedings at any time within three (3) years after the date of the judgment.
   </p>
   <p>
    In recoveries against the occupants, no account for any mesne profits shall be allowed unless they shall have accrued within three (3) years prior to the commencement of the suit in which they may be claimed.
   </p>
   <p>
    In any of these equitable proceedings, the court may allow to the owner of the lands, as a setoff against the value of the improvements and taxes, the value of all rents accruing after the date of the judgment in which it has been allowed.

     18-60-214. Lien of tax deed holder for improvement by reason of survey.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    (1)If any person believing himself or herself to be the owner, either in law or equity, under a clerk's tax deed or a Commissioner of State Lands' forfeited land deed, containing a valid and proper description constituting color of title, has, or shall, peaceably improve any land by having the boundaries surveyed and corners established by the county surveyor of the county in which the land is situated and, upon judicial investigation of the title to the land, it is found that the forfeiture for nonpayment of taxes is void and that the land belongs to another or that the former owner is entitled to redeem from the tax forfeiture, the value of the improvement to the land by reason of the survey shall be paid by the successful party to the holder of the tax deed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The holder of the tax deed shall have a lien on the lands for this amount, which may be enforced by equitable proceedings at any time within three (3) years after the date of the judgment.
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   This section shall not repeal any statute providing for recovery of improvements and betterments but shall be cumulative to §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-213ol1a" target="_self">18-60-213(a)</a></cite> and to all other existing laws not inconsistent with it.

    Acts 1875, No. 85 [repealed], as amended by Acts 1875 (Adj. Sess.) No. 56; Acts 1891, No. 8 [repealed] and Acts 1947, No. 373 [repealed], which declare and describe the cause of action for forcible entry and detainer and unlawful detainer and prescribe the procedure for carrying out the rights and remedies granted to affected parties thereunder, is in need of clarification and revision in order that persons affected thereby may be afforded reasonable opportunity to be heard on legitimate objections to writs of possession entered in accordance with the provisions of this law.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is, therefore, found to be to the best interest of the people of this state that an additional procedure be specifically prescribed for the enforcement of the rights of parties claiming a cause of action by reason of forcible entry and detainer or unlawful detainer of real property and those persons against whom such causes of action are brought.

    No entry by a landlord onto property occupied by another is given by this section, except by first resorting to legal process; accordingly, self-help action is prohibited. Gorman v. Ratliff, 289 Ark. 332, 712 S.W.2d 888 (1986).
   </p>
   <p>
    The tenants did not waive their rights under the forcible entry and detainer statutes by executing the lease agreement which authorized the landlord's self-help remedy. Gorman v. Ratliff, 289 Ark. 332, 712 S.W.2d 888 (1986).

   <p>
    A person shall be guilty of a forcible entry and detainer within the meaning of this subchapter if the person shall:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t18c60s18-60-303ol11">
     Enter into or upon any lands, tenements, or other possessions and detain or hold them without right or claim to title;
    </li>
    <li id="t18c60s18-60-303ol12">
     Enter by breaking open the doors and windows or other parts of the house, whether any person is in it or not;
    </li>
    <li id="t18c60s18-60-303ol13">
     Threaten to kill, maim, or beat the party in possession or use words and actions as have a natural tendency to excite fear or apprehension of danger;
    </li>
    <li id="t18c60s18-60-303ol14">
     Put out of doors or carry away the goods of the party in possession; or
    </li>
    <li id="t18c60s18-60-303ol15">
     Enter peaceably and then turning out by force or frightening by threats or other circumstances of terror the party to yield possession.
     <p>
      The remedy is designed to protect the actual possession, whether rightful or wrongful; it must be shown that the defendant entered without the consent of the person in actual possession, and that the entry or subsequent holding of possession was with force. Johnson v. West, 41 Ark. 535 (1883) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of former similar statute was to prevent all persons with or without title from assuming to right themselves with a strong hand when peaceable possession is withheld, as such action provokes breach of the peace. Littell v. Grady, 38 Ark. 584 (1881); Anderson v. Mills, 40 Ark. 192 (1882); Grammer v. Blansett, 93 Ark. 421, 124 S.W. 1037 (1910) (preceding decisions under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      Force is the gist of the action, and it must be actual and hostile. Hall v. Trucks, 38 Ark. 257 (1881); Miller v. Plummer, 105 Ark. 630, 152 S.W. 288 (1912) (preceding decisions under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      One having title and right of possession may get possession peaceably and hold by force and not be guilty of forcible entry and detainer. Towell v. Etter, 69 Ark. 38, 63 S.W. 53 (1901) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      Actual physical force is not necessary. Douglas v. Lamb, 157 Ark. 11, 247 S.W. 77 (1923) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      One has right to recover possession of which he was deprived through a reasonable fear that he may be maimed or beaten. Holzman v. Gattis, 195 Ark. 773, 114 S.W.2d 3 (1938) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      The tenants did not waive their rights under the forcible entry and detainer statutes by executing the lease agreement which authorized the landlord's self-help remedy. Gorman v. Ratliff, 289 Ark. 332, 712 S.W.2d 888 (1986).
     </p>
     <p>
      It is no defense that the defendant is legally entitled to the possession. Logan v. Lee, 53 Ark. 94, 13 S.W. 422 (1890) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      As a present right of possession is essential to a recovery in forcible entry and detainer as well as unlawful detainer, a landlord cannot, during the term of a lease, recover the leased premises in either action from one who, by permission of a sub-lessee in possession as such, has taken possession of a portion of the premises under an adverse claim of title. King v. Duncan, 62 Ark. 588, 37 S.W. 228 (1896) (decision under prior law).

        Failure or refusal of a tenant to pay rent when due, and to quit possession after demand therefor in writing, is a ground for action of unlawful detainer, independent of its being a ground of forfeiture in the contract or lease. Parker v. Geary, 57 Ark. 301, 21 S.W. 472 (1893) (decision under prior law).
       </p>

        Trial court erred in holding that a subtenant was an assignee rather than a sublessee and was not required to surrender possession of commercial premises upon breach by original lessee where the subtenant and original lessee's intention was that they consistently referred to their arrangement as a sublease; further, in their pleadings and at trial, the parties exclusively referred to the original tenant's transfer to the subtenant as a sublease rather than an assignment. Abernathy v. Adous, 85 Ark. App. 242, 149 S.W.3d 884 (2004).

        Crawford County Circuit Court erred by dismissing a seller's unlawful-detainer complaint based on the doctrine of claim preclusion because the seller did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the unlawful-detainer claim in another county; section 18-60-306 specifically prohibited the seller from asserting his unlawful-detainer claim in Pulaski County, and the Pulaski County Circuit Court correctly determined that it did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim.D&T Pure Trust v.

        Because the parties did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate all components of an unlawful-detainer action in Pulaski County, the Crawford County Circuit Court was not barred from doing so on the basis of issue preclusion; although the Pulaski County Circuit Court determined the amount of unpaid rent the buyer owed the seller, it specifically found that the rent amounts were instructive and not binding on the Crawford County court.D&T Pure Trust v.

        <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving jury instructions on the unlawful detainer statute and the criminal possession of real property statute because the instructions were correct statements of the law since they tracked the statutory language of subdivision (2) of this section and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c16s18-16-101ol1a" target="_self">18-16-101(a)</a></cite> and (b)(1); there was some basis in the evidence to give the instructions because the lawfulness of the respective parties'legal right to possess real property bore on the issue of punitive damages, and the evidence did not demonstrate that an unlawful detainer action or misdemeanor charges were ever filed, but it was evident that there could have been grounds for such civil or criminal proceedings given the evidence adduced at trial.Schmidt v. Stearman, 2010 Ark. App. 274, 374 S.W.3d 254 (2010).

        A tenant holding over and paying rent for another year becomes a tenant for years entitled to six months' notice, but if there is a new rental agreement for a year, the tenant holds for that year and is only entitled to the statutory notice to vacate in event he holds possession after the expiration of the term of his lease. Chappell v. Reynolds, 206 Ark. 452, 176 S.W.2d 154 (1943) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is an allegation in the complaint that there was a default in rent, it is necessary to prove service of notice and order to quit for only three days. Lingo v. Myers, 211 Ark. 638, 201 S.W.2d 745 (1947) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an unlawful-detainer action, trial court's award of treble damages for the period prior to the filing of the formal notice to vacate was proper because all subdivision (3) of this section required in cases of failure to pay rent was three days'written notice to quit and demand for possession. According to the owner's testimony, that was provided by her attorney's letter.Mendez v. Aguilar, 2010 Ark. App. 268 (2010).

        It is no defense that the defendant is legally entitled to the possession. Logan v. Lee, 53 Ark. 94, 13 S.W. 422 (1890) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a present right of possession is essential to a recovery in forcible entry and detainer as well as unlawful detainer, a landlord cannot, during the term of a lease, recover the leased premises in either action from one who, by permission of a sub-lessee in possession as such, has taken possession of a portion of the premises under an adverse claim of title. King v. Duncan, 62 Ark. 588, 37 S.W. 228 (1896) (decision under prior law).

        Allegation held sufficient to assert that plaintiff was entitled to possession. Lingo v. Myers, 211 Ark. 638, 201 S.W.2d 745 (1947) (decision under prior law).
       </p>

        In an unlawful detainer suit, the landlord is not required to deraign title as title is not involved in the suit but only the right of possession. McGee v. Nuckols, 136 F. Supp. 948 (E.D. Ark. 1955) (decision under prior law).

       Substantial evidence supported finding of a city's unlawful detainer, and, because substantial evidence of the rent due was presented, there was no need for evidence of fair market value; however, the triple damages award against the city was error because the space rented by the city was used as a courtroom, and was not used for any purpose pertaining to commerce. Thus, there was no entitlement to triple damages under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-309ol1b2" target="_self">18-60-309(b)(2)</a></cite>.City of Pine Bluff v.

        Unlawful detainer summary judgment was proper because appellant tenant did not show occupancy under a license granted in an oral partnership agreement; no partnership existed and the tenant occupied the premises at will.Anderson's Taekwondo Ctr. Camp Positive, Inc. v. Landers Auto Group No. 1, Inc., 2015 Ark. 268 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment on appellant's counterclaim for promissory estoppel and detrimental reliance was reversed because appellant provided proof that there was an agreement or promise between the parties and that it allegedly relied on that agreement in expending money to improve the property, a service bay at a car dealership; a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether appellant detrimentally relied on appellee's promise to use the property and what improvements were actually made by appellant.Anderson's Taekwondo Ctr. Camp Positive, Inc. v. Landers Auto Group No. 1, Inc., 2015 Ark. 268 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlawful detainer is a remedy for the benefit of landlords against tenants who hold over after the expiration of their term and may be maintained either by the lessor, his heirs or assignee, to whom the land passes. See Buckner v. Warren, 41 Ark. 532 (1883); Johnson v. West, 41 Ark. 535 (1883) (preceding decisions under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlawful detainer will lie where there has been a sale of land with a stipulation that upon the failure of the vendee to pay at maturity, he shall pay rent. Ish v. McRae, 48 Ark. 413, 3 S.W. 440 (1886) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grantee or assignee of landlord may bring unlawful detainer. Cherry v. Kirkland, 138 Ark. 33, 210 S.W. 344 (1919) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grantees who held for owner's benefit could not maintain unlawful detainer action. Hilliard v. Jen Yim, 207 Ark. 161, 179 S.W.2d 456 (1944) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Willful holding over necessary to support a judgment for treble damages was not required to support an action for unlawful detainer. Heral v. Smith, 33 Ark. App. 143, 803 S.W.2d 938 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administratrix of the decedent's estate, who was the decedent's widow, was entitled to pursue an unlawful detainer action against the decedent's parent, after the parent conveyed a property to the decedent, the parent moved into a house that the decedent built on the property, and the administratrix executed an administratrix deed following the decedent's death that gave the administratrix title to the property, because the administratrix made a written demand for surrender to the parent and the parent failed to surrender.Stamps v. Brown-Epps, 2015 Ark. App. 631, 474 S.W.3d 906 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature contemplated actions for unlawful detainer under this section to include situations where a landlord-tenant relationship is not present; to rule that all unlawful-detainer actions must contain an element of landlord-tenant relationship would render the language of subdivision (2) meaningless.Stamps v. Brown-Epps, 2015 Ark. App. 631, 474 S.W.3d 906 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlawful detainer will not lie save where the relation of landlord and tenant exists. Dortch v. Robinson, 31 Ark. 296 (1876); Necklace v. West, 33 Ark. 682 (1878); Mason v. Delancy, 44 Ark. 444 (1884); Lindsey v. Bloodworth, 97 Ark. 541, 134 S.W. 959 (1911); Miller v. Plummer, 105 Ark. 630, 152 S.W. 288 (1912); White River Land & Timber Co. v. Hawkins, 128 Ark. 277, 194 S.W. 9 (1917); Dover v. Henderson, 195 Ark. 496, 112 S.W.2d 963 (1938); Cline v. Smith, 205 Ark. 136, 167 S.W.2d 872 (1943); Hilliard v. Jen Yim, 207 Ark. 161, 179 S.W.2d 456 (1944) (preceding decisions under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where lease and sublease had been canceled pursuant to provisions of the lease, sublessee became a tenant at will of lessor and action of unlawful detainer was maintainable. Dover v. Henderson, 195 Ark. 496, 112 S.W.2d 963 (1938) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of action for unlawful detainer is based on the contract relationship of landlord and tenant. McGee v. Nuckols, 136 F. Supp. 948 (E.D. Ark. 1955) (decision under prior law).

      A tenant unable to give a retaining bond did not waive his right to damages for wrongful eviction by vacating the premises before forcible eviction by the sheriff after posting of eviction bond by landlord. Woods v. Kirby, 238 Ark. 382, 382 S.W.2d 4 (1964) (decision under prior law).

     </p>

      Instruction stating that plaintiff was entitled to possession upon showing he had legal title thereto, without finding that he was deprived of his possession by force, was error. Holzman v. Gattis, 195 Ark. 773, 114 S.W.2d 3 (1938) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, an action of unlawful detainer is a two-step process: the right to possession is to be preliminarily determined and, if appropriate, a writ of possession issued, but the question of damages will be left for a subsequent hearing.

    When any person to whom any cause of action shall accrue under this subchapter shall file in the office of the clerk of the court a complaint signed by him or her, his or her agent or attorney, specifying the lands, tenements, or other possessions so forcibly entered and detained, or so unlawfully detained over, and by whom and when done, and shall also file the affidavit of himself or herself or some other credible person for him or her, stating that the plaintiff is lawfully entitled to the possession of the lands, tenements, or other possessions mentioned in the complaint and that the defendant forcibly entered upon and detained them or unlawfully detains them, after lawful demand therefor made in the manner described in this subchapter, the clerk of the court shall thereupon issue a summons upon the complaint. The summons shall be in customary form directed to the sheriff of the county in which the cause of action is filed, with direction for service thereof on the named defendants. In addition, he or she shall issue and direct the sheriff to serve upon the named defendants a notice in the following form:
   </p>
   <p>
    “NOTICE OF INTENTION TO ISSUE WRIT OF POSSESSION You are hereby notified that the attached complaint in the above styled cause claims that you have been guilty of [forcible entry and detainer] [unlawful detainer] (the inapplicable phrase shall be deleted from the notice) and seeks to have a writ of possession directing the sheriff to deliver possession of the lands, tenements, or other possessions described in the complaint delivered to the plaintiff. If, within five (5) days, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, from the date of service of this notice, you have not filed in the office of the clerk of this court a written objection to the claims made against you by the plaintiff for possession of the property described in the complaint, then a writ of possession shall forthwith issue from this office directed to the sheriff of this county and ordering him to remove you from possession of the property described in the complaint and to place the plaintiff in possession thereof. If you should file a written objection to the complaint of the plaintiff and the allegations for immediate possession of the property described in the complaint within five (5) days, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, from the date of service of this notice, a hearing will be scheduled by the court to determine whether or not the writ of possession should issue as sought by the plaintiff. If you continue to possess the property described in the complaint, you are required to deposit into the registry of the court a sum equal to the amount of rent due on the property and continue paying rent into the registry of the court during the pendency of these proceedings in accordance with your written or verbal rental agreement. Your failure to tender the rent due without justification is grounds for the court to grant the writ of possession. Clerk of Circuit/District Court”

    An action of unlawful detainer is only to decide the right to the immediate possession of lands and tenements and not to determine the rights or title of the parties to such lands. Cortiana v. Franco, 212 Ark. 930, 208 S.W.2d 436 (1948) (decision under prior law).

    If the defendant admits his status as a tenant he cannot defend his possession by asserting title to the land, but this does not mean that a defendant in this type of action can never prove that he owns the land; therefore, if defendant has denied the landlord-tenant relationship, he is entitled to bolster his denial on the trial by an attack on his adversary's title.

     If upon the trial of any action brought under this subchapter the finding or verdict is for the plaintiff, the court or jury trying it shall assess the amount to be recovered by the plaintiff for the rent due and agreed upon at the time of the commencement of the action and up to the time of rendering judgment or, in the absence of an agreement, the fair rental value.

       When the property sought to be recovered is used for residential purposes only, the plaintiff shall receive an amount equal to the rental value for each month, or portion thereof, that the defendant has forcibly entered and detained or unlawfully detained the property; and

     </p>
     <p>
      Where the party in possession of real estate refuses to surrender possession, but wrongfully retains possession, he agrees to pay the owner, not only the rent but damages for such wrongful withholding. Damages include a judgment against the owner for failure to give possession, costs and attorney fees and a reasonable travel expense. Garrott v. Kendal, 212 Ark. 210, 205 S.W.2d 192 (1947).

     </p>
     <p>
      Where evidence showed that tenant signed written lease giving him three year lease with option of renewal for three years, which landlord refused to sign, but allowed tenant to remain for three years, tenant was not liable for treble damage by holding over even though landlord contended lease was from month to month. Johnson v. Taylor, 220 Ark. 46, 246 S.W.2d 121 (1952) (decision under prior law).

     </p>
     <p>
      In the absence of a showing that there was willful and wrongful detainer, landlord was not entitled to triple damages. Warmack v. Merchants Nat'l Bank, 272 Ark. 166, 612 S.W.2d 733 (1981).
     </p>

      Seller entitled to unpaid rent based on twice the amount of fair rental value under unlawful detainer law notwithstanding purchasers' argument that under the contract, they did not owe seller anything at the time suit was filed. Perryman v. Hackler, 323 Ark. 500, 916 S.W.2d 105 (1996).
     </p>
     <p>
      Treble damages disallowed although purchasers did not vacate the property when demand was made and did not surrender the property until ordered to do so by the court, since before such liability can be imposed, there must be a finding of willful or wrongful holding over, and there was no argument characterizing purchasers' failure to vacate as wrongful. Harvill v. Bevans, 52 Ark. App. 57, 914 S.W.2d 784 (1996).

     <p>
      Where trial court found son unlawfully detained his father's property but only awarded damages in the amount of the fair-market-rental value from August 17, 2001, until possession of said lands was delivered; in contravention of subdivision (b)(1) of this section, the circuit court failed to award the mandated liquidated damages in the amount of $300 per month for the same time period. Waterall v. Waterall, 85 Ark. App. 363, 155 S.W.3d 30 (2004).
     </p>
     <p>
      Court properly awarded landlord treble damages for tenants' holdover where tenants' failure to vacate was willful; tenants were told by landlord in an October 2 letter that a default would be declared if they performed again in an untimely manner, however, tenants failed to tender the November rent until November 4 and then asserted, without a reasonable basis therefore, that their payment was timely. Southway Corp. v. Metro. Realty & Dev. Co., LLC, 90 Ark. App. 51, 206 S.W.3d 250 (2005).
     </p>
     <p>
      Substantial evidence supported finding of a city's unlawful detainer, and, because substantial evidence of the rent due was presented, there was no need for evidence of fair market value; however, the triple damages award against the city was error because the space rented by the city was used as a courtroom, and was not used for any purpose pertaining to commerce. Thus, there was no entitlement to triple damages under subdivision (b)(2) of this section.City of Pine Bluff v. Pine Bluff/Jefferson County Library, 2010 Ark. 327 (2010).
     </p>
     <p>
      In an unlawful-detainer action, a store owner was entitled to back rental and treble damages pursuant to subdivision (b)(2) of this section because the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Ark. R. Civ. P. 15(b) in refusing to dismiss the owner's treble-damages claim, which was pled the day of trial. It was apparent from the commencement of the proceeding that the property involved was commercial.Mendez v. Aguilar, 2010 Ark. App. 268 (2010).
     </p>
     <p>
      Use of the word “shall” in subsection (b) of this section mandates an award of liquidated damages to the owner in an action for unlawful detainer.Cleary v. Sledge Props., 2010 Ark. App. 755, 379 S.W.3d 680 (2010).
     </p>
     <p>
      Crawford County Circuit Court erred by dismissing a seller's unlawful-detainer complaint based on the doctrine of claim preclusion because the seller did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the unlawful-detainer claim in another county; section 18-60-306 specifically prohibited the seller from asserting his unlawful-detainer claim in Pulaski County, and the Pulaski County Circuit Court correctly determined that it did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim.D&T Pure Trust v. DWB, LLC, 2019 Ark. App. 122, 572 S.W.3d 451 (2019).
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the parties did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate all components of an unlawful-detainer action in Pulaski County, the Crawford County Circuit Court was not barred from doing so on the basis of issue preclusion; although the Pulaski County Circuit Court determined the amount of unpaid rent the buyer owed the seller, it specifically found that the rent amounts were instructive and not binding on the Crawford County court.D&T Pure Trust v. DWB, LLC, 2019 Ark. App. 122, 572 S.W.3d 451 (2019).
     </p>
     <p>
      Crawford County Circuit Court erred by dismissing a seller's unlawful-detainer complaint based on the concept of judicial economy; judicial economy, by itself, is insufficient to support dismissal.D&T Pure Trust v. DWB, LLC, 2019 Ark. App. 122, 572 S.W.3d 451 (2019).
     </p>
     <p>
      Intervener in forcible entry action who unsuccessfully asserted title against plaintiff was not entitled to complain of judgment holding her jointly and severally liable with tenant for damages and rent on property of which tenant remained in possession pending litigation. De Clerk v. Spikes, 206 Ark. 1004, 178 S.W.2d 70 (1944) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      A judgment awarding the defendant possession of land and house held proper. Davis v. Goodman, 62 Ark. 262, 35 S.W. 231 (1896) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      Judgment for restitution of the premises to the defendant on a verdict awarding damages for unlawful eviction was proper. Wakin v. Morgan, 165 Ark. 234, 263 S.W. 783 (1924) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      Testimony as to what the premises would rent for is not the only way, but is at least one way, of ascertaining the rental value in an unlawful detainer action. Sumlin v. Woodson, 211 Ark. 214, 199 S.W.2d 936 (1947) (decision under prior law).
     </p>
     <p>
      After awarding summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff's adverse possession claim, a trial court erred under subsection (a) of this section in denying defendant's claim for damages on its unlawful detainer counterclaim; if the use of the word “shall” was deemed to mandate an award of liquidated damages under subsection (b), it was deemed to mandate an award of damages for the fair market rental of the property under subsection (a).Cleary v. Sledge Props., 2010 Ark. App. 755, 379 S.W.3d 680 (2010).

      Effective Dates. Acts 1941, No. 92, § 3: Feb. 25, 1941. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and declared by the General Assembly that the present statute relative to partition of real property in Arkansas, having been enacted many years ago, is inadequate and not broad enough to provide this form of relief in numerous cases in the State of Arkansas, and which are working an unjust hardship upon citizens owning property jointly, in common or in coparceny, absolutely or subject to the life estate of another or otherwise, and that such condition is hindering the alienation of real property and prejudicing the property rights of many citizens. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist, and this act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in full force from and after the date of its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1947, No. 161, § 3: Mar. 3, 1947. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and declared by the General Assembly that the present statute relative to partition of real property in Arkansas, having been enacted many years ago, is inadequate and not broad enough to provide this form of relief in numerous cases in the State of Arkansas, and which are working an unjust hardship upon citizens owning property jointly, in common, or in coparceny, absolute or subject to the life estate of another or otherwise, or under an estate by the entirety, where said owner shall have been divorced either prior or subsequent to the passage of this act, and that such condition is hindering the alienation of real property and prejudicing the property rights of many citizens. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist, and this act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in full force from and after the date of its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1949, No. 349, § 3: Mar. 21, 1949. Emergency clause provided: “The Fifty-Seventh General Assembly of the State of Arkansas hereby finds and declares that many competent citizens, owners of an interest in real property with an incompetent person, have been denied the right to dispose of such interest when it would have been to the best interest of all concerned to do so; that the denial of such sales, even when supervised by a Court of competent jurisdiction, has prohibited the alienation of property and has unduly worked a hardship upon competent persons owning an interest therein; and, accordingly, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety of the citizens of this State, shall take effect and be in full force from and after the date of its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1963, No. 518, § 3: Mar. 19, 1963. Emergency clause provided: “It having been found by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the present law regarding payment of attorney's fees in partition suits is not clear, and that procedure in such matters vary from court to court within this state, thereby working an undue hardship on attorneys and petitioners in partition suits, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1983, No. 783, § 4: Mar. 24, 1983. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that there is no statutory law currently in effect describing in particular those services for which an attorney's fee may be awarded in partition actions and that since such fees are assessed against the defendants as well as the plaintiffs interest in the property, such codification is necessary to protect the interest of all parties involved in a partition lawsuit. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this Act, being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2013, No. 1184, § 3: Apr. 12, 2013. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the procedure for selling land in a partition action does not allow a method for listing the property for sale or obtaining the best price for the property through a negotiated sale; that a procedural change to permit more flexibility to obtain the best price for property subject to partition should be authorized for the benefit of owners of real property; and that this act is immediately necessary to provide these benefits to pending and future cases to protect the property rights and interest of owners of real property. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Where there was no allegation or evidence produced that the defendants had not had sufficient notice or were discriminated against because of their race or otherwise, application of this section was not unconstitutional. McNeely v. Bone, 287 Ark. 339, 698 S.W.2d 512 (1985).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Trial court erred in refusing to set aside a confirmation of a judicial sale of land held by the grandsons to satisfy an attorney's lien for representation of one grandson; the grandson was not afforded due process before his interest in the property was ordered to be sold, §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-401" target="_self">18-60-401</a></cite> and -403, and the attorney's lien rendered the order void as to him.Williams v. Hall, 98 Ark. App. 90, 250 S.W.3d 581 (2007).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section did not apply to the partition of a leasehold working agreement. Pasteur v. Niswanger, 226 Ark. 486, 290 S.W.2d 852 (1956).
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 18-60-213 applies to tenants in common involved in ejectment and trespass actions, and does not apply to tenants in common involved with a partition suit which is governed by this section. Graham v. Inlow, 302 Ark. 414, 790 S.W.2d 428 (1990).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the owners of an undivided interest in oil, gas, and mineral leases to certain land conveyed a smaller undivided fraction of the leases to attorneys at law to represent them in litigation concerning such leases, the clients had a right upon petition to a partition of that interest. Schnitt v. McKellar, 244 Ark. 377, 427 S.W.2d 202 (1968).
     </p>
     <p>
      Lands cannot be partitioned if the lands are adversely held, or the title to the lands is in dispute, unless the lands are vacant and not in actual possession. Where the cotenant has been ousted, or his rights totally denied by his cotenant, his remedy is by ejectment, in which he may recover his just proportion of the land, and also of the rents and profits. London v. Overby, 40 Ark. 155 (1882).
     </p>
     <p>
      A party claiming legal title cannot maintain partition with cotenant while his interests are adversely held by others. His title must first be established at law. Moore v. Gordon, 44 Ark. 334 (1884).
     </p>
     <p>
      Ejectment is the only remedy for a tenant in common who is not in actual possession and whose title is denied by his cotenants. Criscoe v. Hambrick, 47 Ark. 235, 1 S.W. 150 (1886).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where appellants failed to identify the precise interests held in the property they were seeking to divide, a grant of a partition under this section would not only have been improper, but would have been impossible. Trice v. Trice, 91 Ark. App. 309, 210 S.W.3d 147 (2005).
     </p>
     <p>
      A third party may execute against a spouse's interest in a tenancy by the entirety, subject to the other spouse's continued rights of possession and survivorship, and interest in one-half of the rents and profits. Morris v. Solesbee, 48 Ark. App. 123, 892 S.W.2d 281 (1995).
     </p>
     <p>
      One with a dower right only in real property has a sufficient interest to sue for partition against the remaindermen. Smith v. Smith, 235 Ark. 932, 362 S.W.2d 719 (1962), overruled on other grounds, Bell v. Wilson, 298 Ark. 415, 768 S.W.2d 23 (1989); Gibson v. Gibson, 264 Ark. 418, 572 S.W.2d 146 (1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, a widow having an unassigned dower interest in land could maintain the partition suit she had filed against the grandson, a minor, who held his undivided one-half interest in fee. Smith v. Smith, 235 Ark. 932, 362 S.W.2d 719 (1962), overruled on other grounds, Bell v. Wilson, 298 Ark. 415, 768 S.W.2d 23 (1989).
     </p>
     <p>
      The exercise of jurisdiction of the chancery court under this section is not prevented by the widow's unassigned dower. Doss v. Taylor, 244 Ark. 252, 424 S.W.2d 541 (1968).
     </p>
     <p>
      The 1947 amendment operated prospectively as regards entirety estates and could not affect those created prior to the effective date of the act; therefore, if an entirety estate created prior to 1947 could not be divided against the wishes of one tenant in divorce proceedings, the entirety estate could not be partitioned against the wishes of one tenant in a partition proceeding. Brown v. Brown, 233 Ark. 422, 345 S.W.2d 27 (1961).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Where an estate by the entirety could not be divided by the court prior to the enactment of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.09.html#t09c12s9-12-317" target="_blank">9-12-317</a></cite>, one of the owners could not claim adverse possession where the other owner quit living on the property following the divorce of the owners by the entirety. Hubbard v. Hubbard, 251 Ark. 465, 472 S.W.2d 937 (1971).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section requires that tenants by the entirety be validly divorced. Stewart v. Stewart, 16 Ark. App. 164, 698 S.W.2d 516 (1985).
     </p>
     <p>
      Noticeably absent from this section is the right to partition an estate by the entirety where the tenants are still married; an estate by the entirety, which is peculiar to marriage, entails the right of survivorship, and such right can be dissolved only in a divorce proceeding, by death, or by the voluntary action of both parties. Lowe v. Morrison, 289 Ark. 459, 711 S.W.2d 833 (1986).
     </p>
     <p>
      A third party, who has a money judgment against a husband, cannot force partition and sale of land held by the husband and wife by the entirety. Lowe v. Morrison, 289 Ark. 459, 711 S.W.2d 833 (1986).
     </p>
     <p>
      A third person can obtain a judgment against a husband or wife and that judgment will be a lien against the debtor's interest in the land; however, that claim cannot defeat the interest of the other spouse. Lowe v. Morrison, 289 Ark. 459, 711 S.W.2d 833 (1986).
     </p>
     <p>
      Party who treated tract of land as his own property estopped himself from claiming an undivided interest in the larger property of which the tract was a part. Crain v. Foster, 230 Ark. 190, 322 S.W.2d 443 (1959).
     </p>
     <p>
      Expenses incurred as to land owned jointly by partners should be settled in a proceeding for partition, and not on bill to settle partnership accounts. Jones v. Jones, 23 Ark. 212 (1861).
     </p>
     <p>
      When appellant failed to appeal from the partition order confirming the deed, it became final and protected by the doctrine of res judicata. Magness v. Commerce Bank, 42 Ark. App. 72, 853 S.W.2d 890 (1993).
     </p>
     <p>
      A widow's right of homestead is individual and indivisible and can only be divided or sold with her consent. Henderson v. Henderson, 212 Ark. 31, 204 S.W.2d 911 (1947).
     </p>
     <p>
      The homestead right of a widow in real property is not such an interest in the real estate as will support a partition suit under this section. Gibson v. Gibson, 264 Ark. 420, 572 S.W.2d 148 (1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      Homestead exception held to prevent partition of property. Pascall v. Smith, 267 Ark. 66, 588 S.W.2d 700 (1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Where wife obtained valid Texas divorce, real property held by the couple in Arkansas as tenancy by the entirety should, under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.09.html#t09c12s9-12-317" target="_blank">9-12-317</a></cite>, be converted to a tenancy in common and the proceeds of sale divided equally and husband was not entitled to claim the property as his homestead under this rule even though he occupied it as his home. Rodgers v. Rodgers, 271 Ark. 762, 611 S.W.2d 175 (1981).
     </p>
     <p>
      The homestead exception contained in this section applies only to property held by divorced persons as tenants by the entirety and not to property held as tenants in common. Padgett v. Haston, 279 Ark. 367, 651 S.W.2d 460 (1983).
     </p>
     <p>
      The homestead exception of this section should not be construed to limit the right to partition with respect to each form of tenancy listed in this section, because the express language of the exception refers only to that portion of this section creating a right to partition land held as tenants by the entirety by divorced persons. Padgett v. Haston, 279 Ark. 367, 651 S.W.2d 460 (1983).
     </p>
     <p>
      Improvements made without the assent of cotenants and without promise to contribute to their payment, although not constituting a lien upon the estate, should be taken into consideration in a partition decree. Drennen's Adm'r v. Walker, 21 Ark. 539 (1860).
     </p>
     <p>
      A tenant in common has the right to make improvements on the land without the consent of his cotenants; and, although he has no lien on the land for the value of his improvements, he will be indemnified for them, in a proceeding in equity to partition the land between himself and cotenants, either by having the part upon which the improvements are located allotted to him or by having compensation for them, if thrown into the common mass, because tenants in common might be improved out of their property; however, the cotenant can only receive the enhancement value of the improvement to the property. Graham v. Inlow, 302 Ark. 414, 790 S.W.2d 428 (1990).
     </p>
     <p>
      The statutory regulations for partition of land do not take away the original jurisdiction of chancery. Patton v. Wagner, 19 Ark. 233 (1857).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where initial action for ejectment or partition was filed in circuit court, but Bank filed its action to quiet title and its foreclosure action in chancery court, the actions could be consolidated in chancery court; although ejectment lies in law, partition may be filed in either law or equity, providing a basis for equitable jurisdiction. Schwarz v. Colonial Mtg. Co., 326 Ark. 455, 931 S.W.2d 763 (1996).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a possessory life estate is owned by a joint tenant or by tenant in common and at least one undivided interest in such land is owned in fee by another joint tenant or tenant in common, then such joint tenant or tenant in common may have partition of the land in which life estate exists, so as to bind the future interest limited after such life estate unless the creator of the life estate directed otherwise. McGee v. Hatcher, 217 Ark. 402, 230 S.W.2d 41 (1950).
     </p>
     <p>
      Partition is available to remaindermen, coparceners, joint tenants, and tenants in common subject to the life estate of another but is not available to a life tenant against the wishes of the remaindermen. Monroe v. Monroe, 226 Ark. 805, 294 S.W.2d 338 (1956).
     </p>
     <p>
      The words “or otherwise” modify and refer to the life estate of another and not to the words “in joint tenancy in common or coparceny” in this section as amended in 1941, so that a life tenant has no right to partition as against remaindermen. Monroe v. Monroe, 226 Ark. 805, 294 S.W.2d 338 (1956).

      Although a life tenant does not have the right to obtain a partition as against the remainderman, the life tenant, when he is also a remainderman, could obtain a partition by giving up any claim to the value of his life estate. Bowman v. Phillips, 260 Ark. 496, 542 S.W.2d 740 (1976).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who acquires a life estate by will or deed does not have the same right of partition or commutation as one who holds a life estate in land by virtue of dower or curtesy, and the owner of a life estate created by a will or deed is not denied equal protection of or equal rights under the law because of the different treatment. Staggs v. Staggs, 277 Ark. 315, 641 S.W.2d 29 (1982).
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 18-60-414 and this section confer upon the chancellor the authority to decide whether partition in kind is feasible; that is a question of fact, the answer to which depends on evidence of the nature of the land and the nature of the interests of the owners. McNeely v. Bone, 287 Ark. 339, 698 S.W.2d 512 (1985).
     </p>
     <p>
      Remainderman is entitled to partition subject to life estate where life tenant is committing waste. Smith v. Smith, 219 Ark. 304, 241 S.W.2d 113 (1951).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section, citizens of the State of Arkansas who have an interest in property as remaindermen, whether or not they have any possessory interest, may utilize the power of partition provided in the statute to partition their respective future interests in the subject property which are subject to and do not affect the life estate of another. Henry v. Kennedy, 273 Ark. 383, 619 S.W.2d 632 (1981).
     </p>
     <p>
      When a coparcener has used rents and profits from the common property, in partition, no lien can be declared upon share of such coparcener for such sums. Clark v. Hershey, 52 Ark. 473, 12 S.W. 1077 (1889); Brown v. Bocquin, 57 Ark. 97, 20 S.W. 813 (1892).
     </p>
     <p>
      After finding that the land was not divisible in kind, and as an appraisal could not be ordered, the court followed the only appropriate option advanced by counsel, a sale. Webber v. Webber, 331 Ark. 395, 962 S.W.2d 345 (1998).
     </p>
     <p>
      Circuit court did not err in refusing to partition the property where the attorney had a lien on the property, not an ownership interest, in the property.Howard v. Adams, 2016 Ark. App. 222, 490 S.W.3d 678 (2016).

     Trial court erred in refusing to set aside a confirmation of a judicial sale of land held by the grandsons to satisfy an attorney's lien for representation of one grandson; the grandson was not afforded due process before his interest in the property was ordered to be sold, §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-401" target="_self">18-60-401</a></cite> and -403, and the attorney's lien rendered the order void as to him.Williams v.

      Publisher's Notes. This section, concerning restriction on the right to partition for certain purchasers of land, was repealed by Acts 2015, No. 107, § 3.This section was derived from Acts 1985, No. 971, §§ 1, 2; A.S.A. 1947, §§ 34-1839, 34-1840; Acts 1991, No. 759, § 1; 2015, No. 107, §3.

      A compromise decree entered with consent of the guardian but without sanction or investigation by the court was void. Rankin v. Schofield, 81 Ark. 440, 98 S.W. 674 (1905).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under this section giving the guardian the right to appear and defend for the minor, the fact that no summons in a partition suit had been served on the minor personally but had been served on his guardian, where minor appeared and asked for affirmative relief, gave the minor no grounds for complaint. Smith v. Smith, 235 Ark. 932, 362 S.W.2d 719 (1962), overruled on other grounds, Bell v. Wilson, 298 Ark. 415, 768 S.W.2d 23 (1989).

     18-60-310. Execution of writ of possession.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Upon receipt of a writ of possession from the clerk of the court, the sheriff shall immediately proceed to execute the writ in the specific manner described in this section and, if necessary, ultimately by ejecting from the property described in the writ the defendant or defendants and any other person or persons who shall have received or entered into the possession of the property after the issuance of the writ, and thereupon notify the plaintiff that the property has been vacated by the defendant or defendants.
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)Upon receipt of the writ, the sheriff shall notify the defendant of the issuance of the writ by delivering a copy thereof to the defendant or to any person authorized to receive summons in civil cases and in like manner.
   </p>
   <p>
    If, within eight (8) hours of receipt of the writ of possession, the sheriff shall not find any such person at their normal place of residence, he or she may serve the writ of possession by placing a copy conspicuously upon the front door or other structure of the property described in the complaint, which shall have like effect as if delivered in person pursuant to the terms of this section.
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)If, at the expiration of twenty-four (24) hours from the service of the writ of possession in the manner indicated, the defendants or any or either of them shall be and remain in possession of the property or possession has not been returned to the plaintiff, the sheriff shall notify the plaintiff or his or her attorney of that fact and shall be provided with all labor and assistance required by him or her in removing the possessions and belongings of the defendants from the affected property to a place of storage in a public warehouse or in some other reasonable safe place of storage under the control of the plaintiff until a final determination by the court.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the determination is in favor of the defendant, then the possessions and belongings of the defendant shall be immediately restored to the defendant with the cost of storage assessed against the plaintiff.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the determination is in favor of the plaintiff, and it includes a monetary judgment for the plaintiff, then the court shall order the possessions and belongings of the defendant sold by the plaintiff in a commercially reasonable manner with the proceeds of the sale applied first to the cost of storage, second to any monetary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and third any excess to be remitted to the defendant.
   </p>
   <p>
    In executing the writ of possession, the sheriff shall have the right forcibly to remove all locks or other barriers erected to prevent entry upon the premises in any manner which he or she deems appropriate or convenient and, if necessary, physically to restrain the defendants from interfering with the removal of the defendants' property and possessions from the property described in the writ of possession.
   </p>
   <p>
    The plaintiff shall not be required to give any bond, unless ordered to do so by the court, as a condition to the execution of the writ by the sheriff.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sheriff shall return the writ at or before the return date of the writ and shall state in his or her return the manner in which he or she executed the writ and whether or not the properties described therein have been delivered to the plaintiff and, if not, the reason for his or her failure to do so.

    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    In all cases of forcible entry and detainer and unlawful detainer, when the defendant disputes the plaintiff's right of possession, it shall be lawful for the defendant to introduce before the court or the jury trying the main issue in the action evidence showing the damage he or she may have sustained in being dispossessed of the lands and premises mentioned in the complaint.
   </p>
   <p>
    The jury, if they find for the defendant, shall at the same time find what damage the defendant has sustained by being dispossessed, if he or she has been so dispossessed, under the provisions of this subchapter, for all of which the court shall render judgment restoring the property to the defendant, as provided for in this subchapter, and shall render judgment against the plaintiff and any surety on any bond posted by the plaintiff for damages as found by the jury, as well as the costs of the suit.

     <p>
      Where the original decree in a partition suit determined the interests of all the parties involved, it became final with the lapse of the term, and a supplemental decree rendered at a subsequent term changing the interests of the parties but not embracing any of the statutory grounds for vacating or modifying the prior decree and alleging no claims that the original decree was procured by fraud was held void.

    Trial court properly dismissed the grandchildren's complaint to set aside a sale and cancel a deed conveying the children's 8/9 interest in the subject property because the restriction on the right of alienability in the testator's will was given to, and was personal to, her surviving children, the conveyance of the children's undivided interest was not a partition of the property, and setting aside the deed would not benefit the grandchildren since they would have the same collective 1/9 interest in the property regardless of the outcome of the litigation.Graham v.

      This section is not violative of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment nor any other provision of the U.S. Constitution. Cole v. Scott, 264 Ark. 800, 575 S.W.2d 149 (1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a lawyer is entitled to an attorney's fee because he files a petition and partition is granted, the fee should be set carefully by the court after deliberation and then only for an amount that is fair and justified. Swinson v. Jarratt, 265 Ark. 242, 578 S.W.2d 197 (1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      There is no fixed formula in partition actions, unlike probate proceedings, to be applied in the determination of an attorney's fee, and the amount of the fee awarded is within the broad discretion of the trial court, although it must not be abused. Padgett v. Haston, 279 Ark. 367, 651 S.W.2d 460 (1983).
     </p>
     <p>
      An award of attorney's fees based on a percentage of the total sales price of partitioned property is not per se unreasonable. Rahat v. Golmirzaie, 332 Ark. 569, 966 S.W.2d 883 (1998).
     </p>
     <p>
      The chancery court properly refused to tax against the defendant's interest any portion of the fee of the successful attorney in a partition suit where the court ordered the sale of the property. Warren v. Klappenbach, 213 Ark. 227, 209 S.W.2d 468 (1948).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where plaintiff filed a petition to quiet title, defendant counterclaimed for partition, and plaintiff filed an amended complaint asking for partition, plaintiff's attorney was allowed the fee as the first one bringing suit for partition since the amended complaint superseded the previous pleadings and was the one on which the decree was rendered. McElhaney v. Cox, 257 Ark. 934, 521 S.W.2d 66 (1975).
     </p>
     <p>
      Arkansas law does not permit an attorney to receive an attorney's fee when he is also a petitioner in a partition suit. Swinson v. Jarratt, 265 Ark. 242, 578 S.W.2d 197 (1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where plaintiff brought a successful partition suit which resulted in the selling of the farm and the dividing of the proceeds along with an accounting for the proper rents and profits offset by the reimbursement allowed for improvements between the four cotenants, chancellor properly awarded an attorney's fee to the plaintiff's attorney for services performed for the benefit of all cotenants. Graham v. Inlow, 302 Ark. 414, 790 S.W.2d 428 (1990).
     </p>
     <p>
      The trial court did not abuse its discretion discretion in awarding attorney's fees of 5 percent of the total sales price of three partitioned parcels since both parties to the action benefited from the partition of the land and it was of no consequence that one party incurred more debt after the sale when they chose to purchase two of the three parcels. Rahat v. Golmirzaie, 332 Ark. 569, 966 S.W.2d 883 (1998).
     </p>
     <p>
      If a partition was a mere incident to a suit to cancel deeds and establish a trust, attorney's fees under this section were properly disallowed. McHenry v. McHenry, 209 Ark. 977, 193 S.W.2d 321 (1946) (decision prior to 1963 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the proceedings are not adversary, a reasonable attorney's fee for plaintiff's attorney should be assessed as costs against all the parties, and an answer which only raises the question as to such fee does not make the suit adversary. Ramey v. Bass, 210 Ark. 1097, 198 S.W.2d 835 (1947) (decision prior to 1963 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to the 1963 amendment, this section was not applicable in an adversary proceeding. Hendrickson v. Duncan, 236 Ark. 722, 370 S.W.2d 131 (1963).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the parties stipulated their respective interests in the subject land and the only issues were the susceptibility of the land to division and attorney's fees, the proceeding was not adversary and it was proper to allow a fee to plaintiff's attorney. Guynn v. Guynn, 237 Ark. 668, 375 S.W.2d 656 (1964) (decision prior to 1963 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      The appointment of a guardian ad litem for the incompetent defendant and the filing of formal pleadings and insisting upon strict proof of the issues by such guardian did not render the proceeding adversary and so preclude the allowance of a fee to plaintiff's attorney. Guynn v. Guynn, 237 Ark. 668, 375 S.W.2d 656 (1964) (decision prior to 1963 amendment).
     </p>
     <p>
      The adversary nature of partition suits is no bar to the allowance of attorney's fees for the services of the attorney bringing the suit and failure or refusal to allow such fees is error. Johnston Smith, 248 Ark. 929, 454 S.W.2d 649 (1970).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a case was essentially a partition suit, there was no error in awarding the attorney's fees and deducting it from the proceeds of the sale. Crouch v. Crouch, 251 Ark. 1047, 476 S.W.2d 248 (1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      The attorney's fee should be assessed and taxed proportionately against all parties. McElhaney v. Cox, 257 Ark. 934, 521 S.W.2d 66 (1975).
     </p>
     <p>
      A cotenant was not entitled to have an attorney's fee taxed as costs in the action where the matter was not raised with the chancellor at or after the trial and there was no evidence of any services which were of common benefit to all parties having been performed by the cotenant's attorney.

       <p>
        “Findings and intent.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a)The General Assembly finds that:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1)Current law concerning partition actions is susceptible of an interpretation that all partition sales are required to be conducted at public auction;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2)Requiring all partition sales to be conducted at public auction may be contrary to the interests of the property owners in some circumstances;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3)The interest of affected property owners may be better served by permitting courts to order a negotiated sale of property that is being partitioned; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4)Permitting courts additional flexibility to order the best manner for conducting a partition sale is a procedural change that should be implemented immediately.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b)It is the intent of this act to allow a court in a partition action to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1)Order the sale of all or part of the property to be sold by a negotiated sale;
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2)Establish the terms and conditions of the negotiated sale; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3)To permit the change in the procedure for selling property in a partition action authorized by this act to apply to cases filed after the effective date of this act.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments. The 2013 amendment added (a)(2) and the (1) designation; and, in the introductory language of (a), substituted “under this subchapter” for “shall”, inserted “all or part of”, deleted “or that any lot or portion thereof is so situated” preceding “that partition”, deleted “thereof” preceding “cannot”, substituted “of the land or tenements” for “thereof”, and substituted “all or part of the land or tenements” for “the premises so situated”.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not authorize a sale of land involved in a partition suit merely to pay the costs. Cowling v. Nelson, 76 Ark. 146, 88 S.W. 913 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        A finding that a sale is necessary should be based upon the consent of parties, on the report of commissioners, or on evidence heard by the chancellor. Moore v. Willey, 77 Ark. 317, 91 S.W. 184 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where two intersecting “runways” had little value except as airplane landing strips but could not, as a practical matter, be utilized for an airport except as a unit, equity required a partition of the realty by sale, rather than partition in kind. Geary v. Kirksey, 234 Ark. 325, 351 S.W.2d 846 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parties to partition proceeding could not object to sale of five apartment buildings in bulk where decree did not provide for sale alternatively as a whole and in parcels where court had jurisdiction of parties and subject matter and purchaser had paid amount of sale price. Hadfield v. Kitzmann, 223 Ark. 459, 266 S.W.2d 801 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though this section contemplates that the sale be made by three commissioners, at least when they recommend a sale, the court would not reverse a decree merely because the circuit clerk was appointed as the commissioner to conduct the sale. Best v. Williams, 263 Ark. 444, 566 S.W.2d 133 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is incorporated by reference in the statute pertaining to partition of oil and gas leasehold interest and it gives the court power to order a sale for cash or on credit, as the court may determine. Overton v. Porterfield, 206 Ark. 784, 177 S.W.2d 735 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cited: Van Landingham v. Cruce, 152 Ark. 562, 239 S.W. 25 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        A commissioner is a trustee and it is his duty and obligation not only to avoid, in every way, participating in the purchase of property, the sale of which is under his supervision, but also to report to the court any possible conflict of interest. Swinson v. Jarratt, 265 Ark. 242, 578 S.W.2d 197 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        A guardian ad litem of infant defendants in a partition suit may not purchase the interest of such defendants. McLaughlin v. Morris, 150 Ark. 347, 234 S.W. 259 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the purchaser at a partition sale had a previous agreement with the guardian of an interested minor heir to let him have a half interest in the land, the sale was voidable. Van Landingham v. Cruce, 152 Ark. 562, 239 S.W. 25 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Partition sale is not complete until confirmed by the court and court had power to disapprove sale, even though term of court had expired. Brown v. Mitchell, 228 Ark. 106, 305 S.W.2d 854 (1957).

     18-60-420. Sale of land not susceptible to division.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    If the commissioners appointed under this subchapter report to the court that all or part of the land or tenements of which partition had been directed are so situated that partition cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners of the land or tenements, the court may, if satisfied that the report is just and correct, make an order that the commissioners sell all or part of the land or tenements:
   </p>
   <p>
    The court making the order of sale shall therein direct the terms and conditions, time and place of sale, the credit, if any, and the security to be taken.
   </p>
   <p>
    The commissioners shall give notice of the time and place and terms of any sale to be made by them, in accordance with the order of the court directing the sale.
   </p>
   <p>
    (1)If the premises consist of distinct farms, buildings, tracts, or lots of land, they shall be sold separately.
   </p>
   <p>
    When any tract of land or lot can be divided for the purpose of sale, with advantage to the parties interested, it may be so divided and sold in parcels.

   There was no basis in bankruptcy law or equity for granting a Chapter 13 debtor's request for a judgment declaring that the debtor was the legal owner of a home she had used as her residence for over 11 years and requiring two individuals who signed a land sale contract with the debtor in 2005 to deliver a deed to the debtor. The evidence established that the debtor did not fulfill the terms of the land sale contract, which allowed her to acquire title to her residence if she obtained adequate financing within a year of the date the contract was signed, and she had an adequate remedy under the Arkansas quiet title statute, §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-501" target="_self">18-60-501</a></cite> to<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-511" target="_self">18-60-511</a></cite>, to resolve her claim that she owned the property.In re Cole, No. 6:14-bk-71968, 2017 Bankr.

      Koonce v.

Therefore, the notice requirements of this section did not have to be met in an adverse possession case where only two parties were involved in a dispute over land separated by a fence.Boyd v.

      Circuit court erred in upholding a quiet title decree because the chancery court lacked jurisdiction to enter the decree, and the decree was void and should have been set aside; because there was no proof of publication of the statutory notice for the required period, the successors in title could not establish a prima facie case to quiet title to the mineral interest in themselves, and the chancery court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to enter the quiet-title decree.XTO Energy, Inc. v.

     <p>
      Where individual's warning order in her action to quiet title to property was published only for two weeks instead of the four weeks required by subsection (a) of this section, it did not comply with the statute and, in the absence of compliance, the individual could not make a prima facie case to quiet title; thus, the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights to the land.

      Circuit court erred in finding that a former sister-in-law established color of title under this section where the lease-purchase agreement contained only the owner's promise to sell the property upon the sister-in-law paying the monthly payments for 18 years, the agreement did not purport to transfer title, and a lease-purchase agreement was not an instrument or paper by which title usually passed.Dodson v.

     The decree in the cause shall not bar or affect the rights of any person who claims through, under, or by virtue of any contract with the petitioner, or who was an adverse occupant of the land at the time the petition was filed, or any person who within seven (7) years preceding had paid the taxes on the land, or a remainderman unless the person shall have been made a defendant in the petition and personally summoned to answer it.
     <p>
      Decree of confirmation was void on direct attack at the instance of one who had paid the taxes on the land for the statutory period preceding such confirmation and who was not made a defendant and served with process in the action. Quertermous v. Bilby, 144 Ark. 98, 221 S.W. 856 (1920); Grayling Lumber Co. v. Tillar, 162 Ark. 221, 258 S.W. 132 (1924).

     <p>
      Action to set aside and vacate decree of confirmation of title brought by claimants who had paid taxes on the property had not been made parties defendant to quiet title action was a direct attack on the decree, not an impermissible collateral attack.

     Summary judgment was improperly granted to an operator and a lessee as they failed to show evidence of entitlement to litigate the validity of a 1976 quiet-title decree based on potential claimants, thus, the limitations in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-510" target="_self">18-60-510</a></cite> applied, and a collateral attack was improper since there were no jurisdictional defects; the operator and the lessee failed to show how any potential claimant came within the reach of subsection (b) of this section as they did not identify any individual who they claimed was seeking royalties, or show that a predecessor in title adverse to the owners was known, but not named in the 1976 action.Verkamp v.

      Where predecessor of plaintiff in title paid taxes on land for required period prior to filing of confirmation petition by owners of tax title, and predecessor was not made a party to the confirmation proceeding, the confirmation decree was not binding on plaintiff.

Shevin, decided June 12, 1972, holding that writs of replevin cannot constitutionally issue without prior notice to the party in possession of personal property, there exists doubt as to the constitutionality of the Arkansas replevin laws. Due to the uncertainty created by the foregoing decision, persons with an enforceable right in personal property are being denied a procedure which enables such rights to be properly enforced, and the value of property held as collateral for loans, or for other reasons, is in danger of diminishing during the interim when such enforcement is delayed. Therefore an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in effect from the date of passage and approval.”

     When the delivery of several articles of property is claimed, the affidavit must state the value of each.
     <p>
      The affidavit is merely a prerequisite to the issuance of the writ and is in no manner connected with the merits of the cause and its truth cannot be contested by plea. Payne v. Bruton, 10 Ark. 53 (1849).
     </p>
     <p>
      An affidavit in a replevin case made by the plaintiff is not relevant to impeach him where he does not deny making it and it does not contradict his testimony. Jenkins v. Quick, 105 Ark. 467, 151 S.W. 1021 (1912).
     </p>
     <p>
      It is only when the plaintiff desires the possession or delivery of the property prior to the judgment that he is required to file an affidavit in compliance with this section. Climer v. Aylor, 123 Ark. 510, 185 S.W. 1097 (1916).
     </p>
     <p>
      The affidavit may be amended in the circuit court on appeal from a justice's court to enlarge the damages claimed. Hanf v. Ford, 37 Ark. 544 (1881).
     </p>
     <p>
      Affidavit is subject to amendment. Chapman v. Claybrook, 173 Ark. 705, 293 S.W. 43 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      The affidavit must describe the property in such a manner as to identify it. Hawes v. Robinson, 44 Ark. 308 (1884).
     </p>
     <p>
      No complaint need be filed in the circuit court on appeal from a justice's court when the plaintiff's affidavit contains a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action. Hanner v. Bailey, 30 Ark. 681 (1875).
     </p>
     <p>
      The affidavit is not part of the complaint. Donnelly v. Wheeler, 34 Ark. 111 (1879).
     </p>
     <p>
      The office of the affidavit is to procure the order of delivery. When that is accomplished it has performed its office as an affidavit, and in justice of the peace court serves as a complaint. Hawes v. Robinson, 44 Ark. 308 (1884).
     </p>
     <p>
      It is not essential in an action of replevin in a justice's court that plaintiff file a complaint, but an affidavit complying with this section is necessary to obtain an order of delivery. Chapman v. Claybrook, 173 Ark. 705, 293 S.W. 43 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      Affidavit must be objected to before trial. Thomas v. Owen, 178 Ark. 93, 10 S.W.2d 29 (1928).
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure to show separate values is not ground for dismissal when the aggregate value is stated. Chapman v. Claybrook, 173 Ark. 705, 293 S.W. 43 (1927).
     </p>
     <p>
      In suit to replevin personal property wherein complaint did not allege value of property sought, but in which affidavit set forth a value of property, plaintiff was not limited in recovery to the amount set forth in the affidavit but could recover amount developed by the evidence. Smith v. Smith, 220 Ark. 263, 247 S.W.2d 197 (1952).
     </p>
     <p>
      It is not necessary to have a written answer in justice court or in circuit court on appeal. Texas & St. Louis Ry. v. Hall, 44 Ark. 375 (1884).
     </p>
     <p>
      The dismissal of an action of replevin before trial and a return of the property to the defendant is not a bar to the maintenance of another suit. Martin v. Hodge, 47 Ark. 378, 1 S.W. 694 (1886).
     </p>
     <p>
      Replevin will not lie for property claimed as exempt until the claim for exemption is made in the statutory method. Settles v. Bond, 49 Ark. 114, 4 S.W. 286 (1886).
     </p>
     <p>
      A sale under execution did not divest a debtor of the right to claim the property as exempt when the failure to claim it was unavoidable, and replevin will lie even after sale. Thompson v. Ogle, 55 Ark. 101, 17 S.W. 593 (1891).
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the affidavit is necessary to the obtaining of an order of delivery, it is not a prerequisite to the court's jurisdiction to determine the rights of property without a change of possession during the action so that defects in the affidavit did not call for a dismissal or invalidate the judgment. Higgason v. Braswell, 163 Ark. 348, 258 S.W. 983 (1924).
     </p>
     <p>
      A complaint containing a sufficient description and value of the goods, alleging that the plaintiff is entitled to possession and that the defendant is in unlawful possession, is sufficient to give the court jurisdiction over the subject matter. Feldman v. Feldman, 171 Ark. 1097, 287 S.W. 384 (1926).
     </p>
     <p>
      Three years is the limitation in actions of replevin. Phipps v. Martin, 33 Ark. 207 (1878).
     </p>
     <p>
      The failure of an affidavit to replevin, to state that the plaintiff's cause of action accrued within the period of limitation, is not ground for quashing the writ. Higgason v. Braswell, 163 Ark. 348, 258 S.W. 983 (1924).
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure to issue order of delivery does not affect the nature of the suit. Eaton v. Langley, 65 Ark. 448, 47 S.W. 123 (1898).
     </p>
     <p>
      The affidavit must be filed before an order of delivery can issue. Gates v. Bennett, 33 Ark. 475 (1878); Hawes v. Robinson, 44 Ark. 308 (1884); Schattler v. Heisman, 85 Ark. 73, 107 S.W. 196 (1908); Spear v. Arkansas Nat'l Bank, 111 Ark. 29, 163 S.W. 508 (1914).
     </p>
     <p>
      Proof of plaintiff's possession and a wrongful taking from him, without more, is sufficient to maintain replevin for the property, though it appears that he intends an unlawful disposition of it when recovered. Martin v. Hodge, 47 Ark. 378, 1 S.W. 694 (1886).
     </p>
     <p>
      It is unnecessary in replevin to prove a demand for the property before the suit if the defendant's answer has set up title in himself showing that a demand would have been futile to induce a surrender of the property. Triplett v. Rugby Distilling Co., 66 Ark. 219, 49 S.W. 975 (1899).
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee may maintain replevin for the trust property, but the beneficiaries in the trust cannot. Gates v. Bennett, 33 Ark. 475 (1878).
     </p>
     <p>
      One tenant in common cannot maintain replevin against cotenant for his part of common crop unless there has been a division of it, consummated by an assignment and appropriation of a part to each. Ward v. Worthington, 33 Ark. 830 (1878).
     </p>
     <p>
      One wrongfully detaining property, and refusing to deliver it on demand, may be sued in replevin though he has parted with possession at the time of the suit. Harkey v. Tillman, 40 Ark. 551 (1883); Hamilton & Co. v. Ford, 46 Ark. 245 (1885).
     </p>
     <p>
      The owner of timber which has been taken and converted by a trespasser into crossties may recover the ties or their value from the trespasser or his vendee with or without notice. McKinnis v. Little Rock, Miss. River & Tex. Ry., 44 Ark. 210 (1884); Stotts v. Brookfield, 55 Ark. 307, 18 S.W. 179 (1892).
     </p>
     <p>
      Constable may bring replevin for property levied upon. Jetton v. Tobey, 62 Ark. 84, 34 S.W. 531 (1896).
     </p>
     <p>
      Replevin held not to lie. Hodges v. Nall, 66 Ark. 135, 66 Ark. 139, 49 S.W. 352 (1899).
     </p>
     <p>
      Replevin will not lie against officer levying under regular execution, though based on void judgment. Emerson v. Hopper, 94 Ark. 384, 127 S.W. 467 (1910).
     </p>
     <p>
      Replevin held maintainable. Oldham v. Melton, 205 Ark. 240, 168 S.W.2d 387 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      The owner of property seized under attachment against another may maintain replevin. Willis v. Reinhardt, 52 Ark. 128, 12 S.W. 241 (1889).
     </p>
     <p>
      Replevin lies where property is seized under specific attachment to which it is not subject. Mills v. Pryor, 65 Ark. 214, 45 S.W. 350 (1898).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there is an agreement that the title shall remain in the vendor until property is paid for, no title vests in the vendee until payment, and upon his failure to pay at maturity, the vendor may maintain replevin for the property. Ferguson v. Hetherington, 39 Ark. 438 (1882).
     </p>
     <p>
      When the passing of title is conditioned upon payment, the vendor may maintain replevin without returning notes executed by the purchaser for payment. Kirby v. Tompkins, 48 Ark. 273, 3 S.W. 363 (1886).
     </p>
     <p>
      Property sold with title conditioned upon payment and with a restriction on use until final payment, a breach of the restriction worked a forfeiture and the vendor could maintain replevin without a demand for the property before suit. Faisst v. Waldo, 57 Ark. 270, 21 S.W. 436 (1893).
     </p>
     <p>
      A landlord's lien will not sustain replevin for the crop. Bell v. Matheny, 36 Ark. 572 (1880); Knox v. Hellums, 38 Ark. 413 (1881).
     </p>
     <p>
      The mortgagee of a tenant's crop cannot maintain replevin for the crop without paying the rent. Roth & Co. v. Williams, 45 Ark. 447 (1885).

       The sheriff shall return the bonds with the order.

        The requirement that a redelivery bond be exacted in double the value of the property involved is not one of the conditions of the bond but merely limits the amount of the sureties' liability. McHaney v. Brown, 183 Ark. 201, 35 S.W.2d 594 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        A redelivery bond, though not executed in double the value of the property involved, is sufficient to authorize a summary judgment against the sureties. McHaney v. Brown, 183 Ark. 201, 35 S.W.2d 594 (1931).

        When the defendant continues to retain property during the pendency of an appeal from a justice of the peace, the affidavit in replevin may be amended in the circuit court to enlarge the damages sustained by reason of the appeal. Hanf v. Ford, 37 Ark. 544 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant fails to give the bond, the property remains in custody of sheriff in contemplation of law till turned over to the plaintiff. Hearn v. Ayres, 77 Ark. 497, 92 S.W. 768 (1906).

       <p>
        Dismissal of replevin action in vacation by notation on record following delivery of property to plaintiff on failure of defendant to file bond was without legal authority. Commercial Credit Corp. v. Mackay, 221 Ark. 226, 252 S.W.2d 819 (1952).

        Defendant who was unable to procure a bond to retain possession of the property did not waive his right to recover damages for consequential losses. Lake Village Implement Co. v. Cox, 252 Ark. 224, 478 S.W.2d 36 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an automobile was delivered to the defendant in a replevin suit upon his giving bond, the order of the chancellor transferring its custody to a third person upon the application of the defendant's surety was not in excess of the court's jurisdiction and therefore prohibition did not lie.

    <p>
   (1)In all actions for the recovery of personal property, where the defendant has given a delivery bond as provided for by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-816" target="_self">18-60-816</a></cite>, the court or jury trying the cause may render judgment against the defendant for the recovery of the property, or its value, together with all damages sustained by the detention thereof.

   <p>
    Upon motion of the plaintiff the court or jury may also render judgment against the sureties upon the defendant's delivery bond for the value of the property and also for damages as they may be found and determined by the court or jury trying the cause.

    <p>
   If, upon the trial of any replevin cause, judgment is given for the defendant in the action, the court or jury trying the cause may render judgment, not only against the plaintiff for the value of the property taken under the order of delivery in the case, provided it has not been surrendered to the defendant, upon bond, as provided for in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-816" target="_self">18-60-816</a></cite>, together with all damages sustained by the defendant in the action, but may, upon motion of the defendant, also render judgment against the sureties upon the bond of the plaintiff, for the value of the property and all damages sustained by the defendant in the action.

   <p>
    In actions for recovery of specific personal property, the jury must assess the value of the property, and the damages for taking or detention, whenever, by their verdict, there will be a judgment for the recovery or return of the property.

    In a replevin action, where the defense was that the action was brought before the defendant obtained possession, it was error to charge the jury to return a verdict for the property in favor of the defendant if the property was in the plaintiff's possession at the institution of the suit, the defendant in such case being entitled only to costs. Pyburne v. Moses, 54 Ark. 121, 15 S.W. 84 (1891).
   </p>
   <p>
    The recovery of specific personal property is the primary object of a suit in replevin and it was error to instruct the jury that, if they found for the defendant on his counterclaim, they should include in his damages for the wrongful taking, in addition to return of the wrongfully replevied property, the down payment he had made to plaintiff on the purchase of the property. Lake Village Implement Co. v. Cox, 249 Ark. 733, 461 S.W.2d 108 (1970).

   </h4>
   <p>
    In ascertaining the separate value of each article of goods replevied from a sheriff who had seized them under an attachment, it is admissible for the jury to take to the jury room the invoice of the goods taken by the sheriff when he took possession of them, where the invoice is proved to be correct in description and value. Hickman v. Ford & Co., 43 Ark. 207 (1884).
   </p>
   <p>
    A verdict assessing the value of the “property taken” without describing it is sufficient if reference to the complaint makes certain what property is meant. Hobbs v. Clark, 53 Ark. 411, 14 S.W. 652 (1890).
   </p>
   <p>
    Verdict that property or its value be returned, without fixing the value, is defective. Keller v. Sawyer, 104 Ark. 375, 149 S.W. 334 (1912).
   </p>
   <p>
    Where the buyer under conditional sales contract admitted owing a balance on the car, it was error for the court to accept a verdict in favor of buyer wherein no value of the car was found and render a judgment on such verdict. Rebsamen Motors v. Moore, 231 Ark. 249, 329 S.W.2d 155 (1959).

     Waiver of Objections.
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p>
    A verdict in solido when separate articles are replevied is waived, unless objected to before the discharge of the jury. Hobbs v. Clark, 53 Ark. 411, 14 S.W. 652 (1890).
   </p>
   <p>
    While the proper practice in replevin is for the verdict to value separately each article, the right to possession of which is determined by the judgment, so that the judgment may be satisfied by the return of such property, an objection to a verdict which does not thus value the property may be waived and is waived unless objected to before the discharge of the jury. Neal v. Cole, 144 Ark. 547, 223 S.W. 18 (1920).
   </p>
   <p>
    The statute requiring the separate valuation of each specific article replevied may be waived and will be held to be waived where the property replevied is treated as parts of a single unit. Taylor v. Walker, 149 Ark. 134, 231 S.W. 550 (1921).
   </p>
   <p>
    Verdict which did not conform to the statute was permitted to stand, since there was no objection thereto. Garrett v. McAtee, 195 Ark. 1123, 115 S.W.2d 1092 (1938).

   </p>
   <p>
    Not later than 45 days after the notice is sent under subsection (a), any cotenant except a cotenant that requested partition by sale may give notice to the court that it elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale.
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   The purchase price for each of the interests of a cotenant that requested partition by sale is the value of the entire parcel determined under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-1006" target="_self">18-60-1006</a></cite> multiplied by the cotenant's fractional ownership of the entire parcel.

    After expiration of the period in subsection (b), the following rules apply:
   </p>
   <p>
    If the court sends notice to the parties under subdivision (d)(1) or (2), the court shall set a date, not sooner than 60 days after the date the notice was sent, by which electing cotenants must pay their apportioned price into the court. After this date, the following rules apply:
   </p>
   <p>
    If all electing cotenants timely pay their apportioned price into court, the court shall issue an order reallocating all the interests of the cotenants and disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   If no electing cotenant timely pays its apportioned price, the court shall resolve the partition action under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-1008ol1a" target="_self">18-60-1008(a)</a></cite> and (b) as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased.
   </p>
   <p>
    If one or more but not all of the electing cotenants fail to pay their apportioned price on time, the court shall give notice to the electing cotenants that paid their apportioned price of the interest remaining and the price for all that interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not later than 20 days after the court gives notice pursuant to subdivision (e)(3), any cotenant that paid may elect to purchase all of the remaining interest by paying the entire price into the court. After the 20-day period, the following rules apply:
   </p>
   <p>
    If only one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall issue an order reallocating the remaining interest to that cotenant. The court shall issue promptly an order reallocating the interests of all of the cotenants and disburse the amounts held by it to the persons entitled to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   If no cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall resolve the partition action under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-1008ol1a" target="_self">18-60-1008(a)</a></cite> and (b) as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased.
   </p>
   <p>
    If more than one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall reapportion the remaining interest among those paying cotenants, based on each paying cotenant's original fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total original fractional ownership of all cotenants that paid the entire price for the remaining interest. The court shall issue promptly an order reallocating all of the cotenants' interests, disburse the amounts held by it to the persons entitled to them, and promptly refund any excess payment held by the court.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not later than 45 days after the court sends notice to the parties pursuant to subsection (a), any cotenant entitled to buy an interest under this section may request the court to authorize the sale as part of the pending action of the interests of cotenants named as defendants and served with the complaint but that did not appear in the action.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the court receives a timely request under subsection (g), the court, after hearing, may deny the request or authorize the requested additional sale on such terms as the court determines are fair and reasonable, subject to the following limitations:
   </p>
   <p>
    a sale authorized under this subsection may occur only after the purchase prices for all interests subject to sale under subsections (a) through (f) have been paid into court and those interests have been reallocated among the cotenants as provided in those subsections; and
   </p>
   <p>
    <p>
   the purchase price for the interest of a nonappearing cotenant is based on the court's determination of value under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-1006" target="_self">18-60-1006</a></cite>.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby ascertained and declared by the 55th General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that as the law now stands many improvement districts are in danger of losing a large amount of revenue which is justly due them from lands heretofore forfeited to such districts for nonpayment of taxes, and that in many instances such loss of revenue will cause such districts to default in the payment of their bond and interest requirements; and that to permit a person holding under a tax title from the State to avoid payment of improvement district taxes upon lands purchased from the State by him would result in an unequal distribution of taxation and thus throw more burden of taxation upon those taxpayers who have been paying their taxes; that it is not feasible for improvement districts to keep informed, as to the sale to the State and subsequent possession under a deed from the State, as to all of the lands within the boundaries of said district, and that an emergency, therefore, exists, and this act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage.”

          Neither conveyances, nor color of title, nor payment of taxes, nor all combined can give title under this section since there must be actual possession for the requisite period. Calloway v. Cossart, 45 Ark. 81 (1885).

          To amount to an investiture of title there must be open, notorious, peaceful, continuous, and adverse possession for more than the statutory period. Jeffery v. Jeffery, 87 Ark. 496, 113 S.W. 27 (1908).
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          In order that one may acquire a private right of way across another's land, the use must be under a claim of right and not permissive and must be used openly, continuously and adversely for the statutory period. Medlock v. Owen, 105 Ark. 460, 151 S.W. 995 (1912).
         </p>
         <p>
          The possession which will bar the right of a former owner of land must be an open, notorious, continuous and exclusive possession under claim of title. Young v. Knox, 165 Ark. 129, 263 S.W. 52 (1924); Smart v. Murphy, 200 Ark. 406, 139 S.W.2d 33 (1940).
         </p>
         <p>
          In order that adverse possession may ripen into ownership, possession for seven years must have been actual, open, notorious, continuous, hostile and exclusive, and it must be accompanied with an intent to hold against the true owner. Terral v. Brooks, 194 Ark. 311, 108 S.W.2d 489 (1937); Stricker v. Britt, 203 Ark. 197, 157 S.W.2d 18 (1941); Montgomery v. Wallace, 216 Ark. 525, 226 S.W.2d 551 (1950); Dierks Lumber & Coal Co. v. Vaughn, 131 F. Supp. 219 (E.D. Ark. 1954), aff'd, 221 F.2d 695 (8th Cir. 1955); Harrison v. Collins, 247 Ark. 210, 444 S.W.2d 861 (1969).
         </p>
         <p>
          Mere possession, without color of title, for the statutory period is sufficient to vest title in the disseisor, if such possession is actual, adverse, continuous, open, notorious, exclusive, and hostile, and for the statutory period. Rye v. Baumann, 231 Ark. 278, 329 S.W.2d 161 (1959).
         </p>
         <p>
          The statute of limitations is not defensive alone but confers a title which can be enforced by suit. Jacks v. Chaffin, 34 Ark. 534 (1879); Logan v. Jelks, 34 Ark. 547 (1879); Wilson v. Spring, 38 Ark. 181 (1881); Worthen v. Rushing, 228 Ark. 445, 307 S.W.2d 890 (1957).
         </p>
         <p>
          Once title has vested in adverse possessor by running of statute of limitations, his recognition of validity of another's claim to land does not divest the adverse possessor of title. Hudson v. Stillwell, 80 Ark. 575, 98 S.W. 356 (1906); Hutt v. Smith, 118 Ark. 10, 175 S.W. 399 (1915); Stroud v. Snow, 186 Ark. 550, 54 S.W.2d 693 (1932); Dierks Lumber & Coal Co. v. Vaughn, 131 F. Supp. 219 (E.D. Ark. 1954), aff'd, 221 F.2d 695 (8th Cir. 1955).
         </p>
         <p>
          One in adverse possession of land under color of title for more than seven years acquires title. Fletcher v. Josephs, 105 Ark. 646, 152 S.W. 293 (1912).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where adverse possessor had possession of land for over seven years, the title would become vested in him unless he unconditionally acknowledged the title to be in person from whom he later contracted to rent the land. Turquett v. McMurrain, 110 Ark. 197, 161 S.W. 175 (1913).
         </p>
         <p>
          Title of purchasers from adverse possessor may be perfected by the running of the statute. Brinkley v. Taylor, 111 Ark. 305, 163 S.W. 521 (1914).
         </p>
         <p>
          A title acquired by adverse possession is a title in fee simple and is as perfect as a title by deed from the original owner. Smart v. Murphy, 200 Ark. 406, 139 S.W.2d 33 (1940); Stricker v. Britt, 203 Ark. 197, 157 S.W.2d 18 (1941); Hart v. Sternberg, 205 Ark. 929, 171 S.W.2d 475 (1943); Palmer v. Sanders, 233 Ark. 1, 342 S.W.2d 300 (1961).
         </p>
         <p>
          Adverse possession maintained for the statutory seven year period vests title in adverse possessor as completely as would a conveyance from the holder of a valid record title. Montgomery v. Wallace, 216 Ark. 525, 226 S.W.2d 551 (1950); Dierks Lumber & Coal Co. v. Vaughn, 131 F. Supp. 219 (E.D. Ark. 1954), aff'd, 221 F.2d 695 (8th Cir. 1955); Palmer v. Sanders, 233 Ark. 1, 342 S.W.2d 300 (1961); Buckhannan v. Nash, 216 F. Supp. 843 (E.D. Ark. 1963); Neyland v. Hunter, 282 Ark. 323, 668 S.W.2d 530 (1984).
         </p>
         <p>
          Title cannot be acquired by adverse possession of less than the statutory period. Webb v. Miller, 236 Ark. 245, 365 S.W.2d 450 (1963).
         </p>
         <p>
          This section means that when one is in possession of land, no one may question his claim of ownership except within seven years after the cause of action first accrues. Utley v. Ruff, 255 Ark. 824, 502 S.W.2d 629 (1973).

          While color of title is not necessary to give title by limitations, it is necessary to extend the title so acquired beyond the limits of the actual possession. Bradbury v. Dumond, 80 Ark. 82, 96 S.W. 390 (1906); Dierks Lumber & Coal Co. v. Vaughn, 131 F. Supp. 219 (E.D. Ark. 1954), aff'd, 221 F.2d 695 (8th Cir. 1955); Buckhannan v. Nash, 216 F. Supp. 843 (E.D.

          Possession of land for the statutory period will not ripen into title unless it is accompanied by a claim of title in fee. Hardin v. Watson, 104 Ark. 641, 148 S.W. 506 (1912).
         </p>
         <p>
          One who without color of title enters upon a tract of unoccupied real property and takes visible, open and notorious possession of a part cannot extend his possession so as to embrace the whole tract merely by subsequently obtaining color of title to the entire tract and continuing to occupy only the part of the land of which he originally took actual possession. Sanderson v. Thomas, 192 Ark. 302, 90 S.W.2d 965 (1936).
         </p>
         <p>
          Without color of title, it is necessary that adverse possessor have actual possession in order to claim the benefits of this section. National Property Owners Ass'n v. Hogue, 229 Ark. 743, 318 S.W.2d 151 (1958).
         </p>
         <p>
          To prevail on a claim of adverse possession not under color of title, one must show actual possession for the statutory period. Coons v. Lawler, 237 Ark. 350, 372 S.W.2d 826 (1963); Hill v. Surratt, 240 Ark. 122, 398 S.W.2d 225 (1966); DeClerk v. Johnson, 268 Ark. 868, 596 S.W.2d 359 (Ct. App. 1980).
         </p>
         <p>
          An interruption of the possession is a new point from which the statute of limitations must run. Byers v. Danley, 27 Ark. 77 (1871); Pulaski County v. State, 42 Ark. 118 (1883).
         </p>
         <p>
          The possession must be continuous for the full limitations period; if there is a break in the continuity, the adverse holding before and since the break cannot be tacked in computing the period. Brown v. Hanauer, 48 Ark. 277, 3 S.W. 27 (1886), overruled in part, Price v. Price, 253 Ark. 1124, 491 S.W.2d 793 (1973); Nicklace v. Dickerson, 65 Ark. 422, 46 S.W. 945 (1898).
         </p>
         <p>
          Fitful, disconnected acts of possession accompanied with a claim of title is not sufficient to establish title. Brown v. Bocquin, 57 Ark. 97, 20 S.W. 813 (1892).
         </p>
         <p>
          Continuity of adverse possession held not to have been broken. Robinson v. Nordman, 75 Ark. 593, 88 S.W. 592 (1905); McComb v. Saxe, 92 Ark. 321, 122 S.W. 987 (1909); Wilson v. Rogers, 97 Ark. 369, 134 S.W. 318 (1911); Cupp v. Cady, 190 Ark. 700, 81 S.W.2d 417 (1935).

          Continuity of possession held to have been broken. Chicago Mill & Lumber Co. v. Matthews, 163 Ark. 571, 260 S.W. 963 (1924).
         </p>
         <p>
          A prescriptive easement may be created over a ditch or waterway and the circuit court did not err by finding that the adjoining landowner proved the elements of a prescriptive easement as to the road and the ditch, despite the ditch being used only when the road flooded; even a member of the appellant hunting club admitted that the adjoining landowner had continuously used the road and “regularly” used the ditch, the adjoining landowner took steps to maintain the property, and there was no evidence of attempted obstruction of the use between 2005 and 2014, a period in excess of the seven-year prescriptive period required.Five Forks Hunting Club, LLC v. Nixon Family P'ship, 2019 Ark. App. 371, 584 S.W.3d 685 (2019).
         </p>
         <p>
          An executed parol agreement by one to surrender possession to another is sufficient to constitute such continuity of possession and privity between the parties as to authorize the tacking of possession and completion of title by limitation. Horseman v. Hincha, 138 Ark. 415, 211 S.W. 385 (1919).
         </p>

          Although no color of title exists, possession of claimant's predecessors may be tacked to claimant's possession. Dierks Lumber & Coal Co. v. Vaughn, 131 F. Supp. 219 (E.D. Ark. 1954), aff'd, 221 F.2d 695 (8th Cir. 1955).
         </p>
         <p>
          When a co-tenant executes a deed to a stranger to the title, describing the entire land, and such grantee enters into exclusive possession under such deed, then the deed constitutes color of title, and such entry commences the running of limitation in favor of the grantee and against all co-tenants of the grantor. Marshall v. Gadberry, 303 Ark. 534, 798 S.W.2d 99 (1990).

         </p>
         <p>
          Statute of limitations ran against owner until it had knowledge of the adverse holding, even though it had knowledge of the possession; however, where possession was in fact adverse for more than seven years, title was perfected against the record owner whether it had knowledge of the adverse possession or not. Little Rock & Ft. Smith Ry. v. Rankin, 107 Ark. 487, 156 S.W. 431 (1913).
         </p>
         <p>
          In order for adverse possessor to set the statute of limitations in motion, it was necessary for adverse possessor to hold the title adversely and to have exercised such acts of ownership as to indicate an intention to hold the land adversely to the son, who was the remainderman. Miller v. Miller, 130 Ark. 28, 195 S.W. 1071 (1917).
         </p>
         <p>
          To establish title by adverse possession in one who acquired possession under license, he must have given notice that he was holding adversely or his possession must have been so notoriously hostile as to constitute notice. Meador v. Weathers, 167 Ark. 264, 267 S.W. 787 (1925).
         </p>
         <p>
          If the claimant so acts as to attract notice to his claim and persists in such action for the statutory period of time, knowledge of his hostile claim of title may be inferred as a matter of fact. Dierks Lumber & Coal Co. v. Vaughn, 131 F. Supp. 219 (E.D. Ark. 1954), aff'd, 221 F.2d 695 (8th Cir. 1955).

         </p>
         <p>
          When an entry is permissive, the statute will not begin to run against the legal owner until an adverse holding is declared and notice of such change is brought to the knowledge of the owner. Britt v. Berry, 133 Ark. 589, 202 S.W. 830 (1918); United States Bond & Mtg. Co. v. Reddick, 199 Ark. 82, 133 S.W.2d 23 (1939); St. Louis Sw. Ry. v. Wallace, 217 Ark. 278, 229 S.W.2d 659 (1950).
         </p>
         <p>
          The holding of land begun by permission will not ripen into an adverse or hostile right until notice of such adverse holding is brought home to the owner and the holding has continued for the statutory period. Fulcher v. Dierks Lumber & Coal Co., 164 Ark. 261, 261 S.W. 645 (1924); Oliver v. Howie, 170 Ark. 758, 281 S.W. 17 (1926).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where possession, in its incipiency, is permissive, the presumption is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that subsequent possession is permissive also and such possession will not start the running of the statute of limitations. Dial v. Armstrong, 195 Ark. 621, 113 S.W.2d 503 (1938).
         </p>

         Adverse possession of a street of an incorporated town for the statutory period will give title to the occupant and bar the town. Town of El Dorado v. Ritchie Grocery Co., 84 Ark. 52, 104 S.W. 549 (1907) (decision prior to enactment of §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.22.html#t22c01s22-1-201" target="_blank">22-1-201</a></cite>).

          Owners of lots abutting on a platted street have notice of the dedication and can build up no right by continued occupancy on account of delay of the city in opening the streets to public use. City of Paragould v. Lawson, 88 Ark. 478, 115 S.W. 379 (1908).
         </p>
         <p>
          The right to a public highway once established by prescription or limitation may be abandoned by nonuser, and if so abandoned for a period of more than seven years, the right of the owner of the fee to re-enter and exclude the public from the use of the highway is restored. McLain v. Keel, 135 Ark. 496, 205 S.W. 894 (1918); Johnston v. Verboon, 269 Ark. 126, 598 S.W.2d 752 (1980).

         <p>
          Use of an alley for more than seven years by adjoining lot owners under circumstances showing that the use was made as a matter of right and not of permission was held to establish adverse use so as to ripen into title by limitation. McGill v. Miller, 172 Ark. 390, 288 S.W. 932 (1926).
         </p>
         <p>
          The period for acquiring a prescriptive right-of-way over road is analogous to the statutory period for the acquiring of title by adverse possession. Neyland v. Hunter, 282 Ark. 323, 668 S.W.2d 530 (1984).
         </p>
         <p>
          Prescriptive easement to use road not established. Neyland v. Hunter, 282 Ark. 323, 668 S.W.2d 530 (1984).
         </p>
         <p>
          Road in question had been maintained by the highway department for a number of years and by the public for 55 to 60 years to gain access to a nearby river, and the landowners' predecessor in interest made no effort to close the road or to deny the public access; thus, there was sufficient evidence to show that the public openly and continuously used the roadway in question for seven years or more, and that the facts and circumstances surrounding the usage were such that the landowners knew or should have known it was adverse. Carson v. County of Drew, 354 Ark. 621, 128 S.W.3d 423 (2003).
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          Public prescriptive easement existed in the landowners' roadway, turnaround, landing, and parking area where the public had used property for more than seven years and landowners knew or should have known of adverse possession; because there was an acquiescence to longtime use, it operated to put landowners on sufficient notice of a claim of right. Carson v. County of Drew, 354 Ark. 621, 128 S.W.3d 423 (2003).
         </p>
         <p>
          Neighboring land owner, who asserted a claim for an easement to use a gravel drive, failed to show the elements necessary to establish an easement by prescription because the land owner only showed that he had been continuously using the gravel drive for less than seven years, and when he was told to stop using the drive, he did.Drummond v. Shepherd, 97 Ark. App. 244, 247 S.W.3d 526 (2007).
         </p>
         <p>
          When a landowner takes possession under belief that he owns land without recognition of the possible right of another on account of mistake in the boundary line, the former owner's title will be divested after the running of the statute. Shirey v. Whitlow, 80 Ark. 444, 97 S.W. 444 (1906); Goodwin v. Garibaldi, 83 Ark. 74, 102 S.W. 706 (1907); O'Neal v. Ross, 100 Ark. 555, 140 S.W. 743 (1911); Butler v.

         </p>
         <p>
          When a landowner, through mistake as to his boundary line, takes possession of land of an adjacent owner, intending to claim only to the true boundary, such possession is not adverse and, though continued for the statutory period, does not divest title. Shirey v. Whitlow, 80 Ark. 444, 97 S.W. 444 (1906); O'Neal v. Ross, 100 Ark. 555, 140 S.W. 743 (1911); Waters v. Madden, 197 Ark. 380, 122 S.W.2d 554 (1938).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where there is doubt or uncertainty or a dispute as to the true location of a boundary line, the parties may, by parol, fix a line which will at least, when followed by possession with reference to the boundary so fixed, be conclusive upon them although the possession is not for the full statutory period. Turquett v. McMurrain, 110 Ark. 197, 161 S.W. 175 (1913).
         </p>
         <p>
          Adjoining landowners may, by parol, fix a boundary line that will bind them and their grantees, though their possession under such agreement may not continue for the statutory period. Turquett v. McMurrain, 110 Ark. 197, 161 S.W. 175 (1913); Furlow v. Dunn, 201 Ark. 23, 144 S.W.2d 31 (1940).
         </p>
         <p>
          Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow an individual to amend his pleadings under Ark. R. Civ. P. 15(b) to include a counterclaim for a prescriptive easement because the proof did not establish a prescriptive easement, given that there was no evidence of overt, adverse use for the statutory period under this section.Myers v. Yingling, 372 Ark. 523, 279 S.W.3d 83 (2008).

         </p>
         <p>
          A party claiming title by limitation has the burden of proof and where the testimony is not disputed, it is error to take the case from the jury and direct a verdict. Maney v. Dennison, 110 Ark. 571, 163 S.W. 783 (1914).

         </p>
         <p>
          Adverse possession is an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof rests upon one asserting his claim of adverse possession to establish its essential elements by a preponderance of the evidence. Dierks Lumber & Coal Co. v. Vaughn, 131 F. Supp. 219 (E.D. Ark. 1954), aff'd, 221 F.2d 695 (8th Cir. 1955).

         Appellee's counterclaim for quiet title was not barred by §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-126ol1a1" target="_blank">16-56-126(a)(1)</a></cite> as a prior court did not treat appellee's affirmative defense of adverse possession as a counterclaim under subsection (a) of this section, and the nonsuit of the prior action did not affect the statute of limitations, which had not begun to run on the quiet title claim as appellee was still in possession of the property.Sutton v. Gardner, 2011 Ark. App. 737, 387 S.W.3d 185 (2011).
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
          Where a widow conveyed her dower interest in land before it was assigned to her, the heir may recover the land from her vendee, but the statute of limitations is not in motion against the heir when the widow's vendee enters into possession. Brinkley v. Taylor, 111 Ark. 305, 163 S.W. 521 (1914).
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
          Where a widow executed a conveyance of a decedent's homestead, the fact that she had an unassigned right of dower did not bar the right of entry of the decedent's heirs so as to prevent the statute of limitations from running against such heirs. Murphy v. Graves, 170 Ark. 180, 279 S.W. 359 (1926).
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>

         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          At law the statute of limitations must be pleaded to be available, but in equity it has always been considered as affecting the equity of a bill, upon the principle that the court will not interfere to enforce rights upon which claimants have too long slept. Riley v. Norman, 39 Ark. 158 (1882).
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
          In the absence of some intervening equity calling for application of the doctrine of laches, equity by analogy follows the law and will not divest the owner of title by lapse of time shorter than the period of limitations. Earle Imp. Co. v. Chatfield, 81 Ark. 296, 99 S.W. 84 (1907).
         </p>

         <p>
          As the right of an adult child to enter upon the homestead of his parent does not accrue until the homestead right of the youngest child has ceased on his coming of age, the statute of limitations will not run until that time. Harris v. Brady, 87 Ark. 428, 112 S.W. 974 (1908); Smith v. Scott, 92 Ark. 143, 122 S.W. 501 (1909); Lesser v. Reeves, 142 Ark. 320, 219 S.W. 15 (1920); Brownfield v.

         </p>
         <p>
          The clear intention of the 1945 amendment to this section was to permit an improvement district to hold title without taking possession from the landowner but not at the risk of bar of a prospective sale by the limitations period. Davidson v. Hartsfield, 250 Ark. 1072, 468 S.W.2d 774 (1971).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where title to a piece of property had vested in an improvement district as the result of foreclosure, title was in one who had purchased from the improvement district rather than one who claimed to have acquired the land by adverse possession. Davidson v. Hartsfield, 250 Ark. 1072, 468 S.W.2d 774 (1971).
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
          Where the title to minerals is separated from the title to the surface, the statute of limitations does not run against the right to the minerals unless there is an actual adverse holding which constitutes an invasion of these particular rights. Bodcaw Lumber Co. v. Goode, 160 Ark. 48, 254 S.W. 345 (1923).
         </p>
         <p>
          While the state, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, is not barred by the statute of limitations, the public itself, in the assertion of rights through other agencies, is barred by the statute of limitations where there are no limitations in its favor.

         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          Where an incorporated town ceased to elect officers or exercise its functions as such, this would not bar the running of the statute against it as to one occupying a portion of a public street since, in spite of the nonuser of the corporate franchise, it still existed and the town possessed the right to sue. Town of Madison v. Bond, 133 Ark. 527, 202 S.W. 721 (1918).
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          It is well established that the statute of limitations operates against railroad corporations where land is held adversely as well as against individuals and this applies to rights-of-way. St. Louis Sw. Ry. v. Wallace, 217 Ark. 278, 229 S.W.2d 659 (1950).

         </p>
         <p>
          The remainderman alone can protect possession prior to the assignment of dower and as the remainderman is entitled to immediate possession, the statute of limitation will begin to run against him. Hayden v. Hill, 128 Ark. 342, 194 S.W. 19 (1917).
         </p>
         <p>
          There is an exception to the rule that seven years' delay after the death of the decedent bars an application to sell his lands for debts, where his estate in the land was that of a remainderman and the life tenant survived him in which case the statute of limitations did not run until the death of the life tenant. Field v. Tyner, 163 Ark. 373, 261 S.W. 35 (1924).
         </p>
         <p>
          While a valid tax sale bars the right of all interested parties, including those holding remainder interests as well as the life tenant, yet when the sale is void, one who enters under a void sale is a trespasser and the statute of limitations does not run against the remainderman until the expiration of the life estate.

         </p>
         <p>
          Statute of limitations does not run in favor of a vendor who is under obligations to convey the legal title until he has given the vendee notice of such intention. Coleman v. Hill, 44 Ark. 452 (1884).
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>

Perry v. Arkadelphia Lumber Co., 83 Ark. 374, 103 S.W. 724 (1907).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where a vendor of land takes possession to enforce his lien, in order to set the statute of limitations running by adverse possession, there must be either express notice to the owners or acts of such notorious hostility as to put the owners on notice. McGinnis v. Less, 147 Ark. 211, 227 S.W. 398 (1921).
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
          An answer pleading the seven year statute of limitations without alleging that the seven years were before the commencement of the action is insufficient. Gates v. Solomon, 73 Ark. 8, 83 S.W. 348 (1904).
         </p>
         <p>
          Answer held sufficient to raise the defense of the general statute of limitations. McKewen v. Allen, 80 Ark. 181, 96 S.W. 392 (1906).
         </p>
         <p>
          When the defense of adverse possession is pleaded, such plea will be treated as a confession of ouster in ejectment suits. Bradley Lumber Co. v. Burbridge, 213 Ark. 165, 210 S.W.2d 284 (1948).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where an action is brought in the name of a nonexisting plaintiff, an amendment of complaint substituting the proper party to the action as plaintiff will be regarded as the institution of a new action for purposes of this section. White v. Welsh, 327 Ark. 465, 939 S.W.2d 299 (1997).
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
          Where a nonsuit was taken in an action to recover land and a subsequent action begun relying upon a different chain of title from that relied upon in the first action, the running of the statute was not stopped by the commencement of the first action. Covington v. Berry, 76 Ark. 460, 88 S.W. 1005 (1905).
         </p>
         <p>

         <p>
          Owners of land used by a city as a dump did not have a viable cause of action against the city for inverse condemnation because the seven-year statute of limitations had expired; the city's use of the land as a dump since the 1950s showed an intent to possess adversely, and no action had been filed previously. Daniel v. City of Ashdown, 94 Ark. App. 446, 232 S.W.3d 511 (2006).
         </p>
         <p>
          Brother was unable to challenge the validity of a deed supposedly executed by his mother in 1984 because his action was filed 20 years later; the seven-year statute of limitations in this section began to run at the mother's death in 1992. Moreover, laches applied since the purported owner's position was detrimentally changed where witnesses were unavailable.Jaramillo v. Adams, 100 Ark. App. 335, 268 S.W.3d 351 (2007).
         </p>
         <p>
          <p>
         In a case where heirship was being determined, the action was not barred by the limitations periods in this section and §<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-115" target="_blank">16-56-115</a></cite> because the time period did not begin to run until a pecuniary consequence arose; there had been no demand for the trust property that would have triggered the limitations period. Moreover, the case was filed within the limitations period if it began to run when mineral leases were executed.Scroggin v. Scroggin, 103 Ark. App. 144, 286 S.W.3d 758 (2008).

          Circuit court correctly concluded that the claims to the island were barred under this section where the city had asserted ownership rights since at least 1999, the city had claimed exclusive ownership since December 2003 at the latest, and the claimants had not asserted their rights until more than seven years after the seven-year statute of limitations had expired.Blackwood's Island v. Stodola, 2018 Ark. App. 357, 552 S.W.3d 62 (2018).

          The statute does not begin to run against an estate until an administrator is appointed. McCustian v. Ramey, 33 Ark. 141 (1878); Word v. West, 38 Ark. 243 (1881).
         </p>
         <p>
          The statute began to run against an action to declare a deed absolute to be a mortgage and intended to secure a note from the time the note matured. Stebbins v. Clendenin, 136 Ark. 391, 206 S.W. 681 (1918).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where a purchaser of land, finding himself unable to pay for the land, directed his tenant to attorn to the vendor, which was done, and the purchaser died before executing a reconveyance, the attornment by the tenant formed a point from which the statute of limitations would run against the heirs of the purchaser. Freer v. Less, 159 Ark. 509, 252 S.W. 354 (1923).
         </p>
         <p>
          A verbal promise to pay a debt barred by limitation will not revive the debt or remove the bar. Worthington v. De Bardlekin, 33 Ark. 651 (1878).
         </p>
         <p>
          A vendor's lien is barred when the debt is barred. Chase v. Cartwright, 53 Ark. 358, 14 S.W. 90 (1890).
         </p>
         <p>
          There must be an actual adverse holding for the statutory period before a creditor is barred of his right to set aside a fraudulent conveyance and subject the property to the payment of his debt. James v. Mallory, 76 Ark. 509, 89 S.W. 472 (1905).
         </p>
         <p>
          Action to recover interest in land held barred. Landman v. Fincher, 196 Ark. 609, 119 S.W.2d 521 (1938); Grogan v. Weatherby, 196 Ark. 705, 119 S.W.2d 552 (1938); Brandon v. Bryeans, 203 Ark. 1117, 160 S.W.2d 205 (1942).

          Defendant in action to quiet title held barred from asserting claim to land. Manier v. Hodges, 217 Ark. 481, 230 S.W.2d 960 (1950).
         </p>
         <p>
          Action to recover interest in land held not barred. Eades v. Joslin, 219 Ark. 688, 244 S.W.2d 623 (1951).
         </p>
         <p>
          This section does not prohibit a person in possession from suing to remove a cloud on his title even though the cloud has been in existence and within the knowledge of the possessor for more than the statutory period since there is no necessity for resorting to legal remedies until there is an interference with possession. Dotson v. Aldridge, 246 Ark. 456, 438 S.W.2d 464 (1969).
         </p>
         <p>
          This statute of limitation governs the right to challenge another in actual or adverse possession of a tract of land for seven years; accordingly, where developer was in possession of property for more than the statutory period prior to power company's suit for title to the property, such suit was untimely. Arkansas Power & Light Co. v. Arkansas Communities, Inc., 33 B.R. 800 (W.D. Ark. 1983), aff'd, 741 F.2d 185 (8th Cir. 1984).
         </p>
         <p>
          Trial court did not err in denying the neighbors'claim of a prescriptive easement across an owner's real property because testimony that other persons had occasionally used the road at issue to access the property behind the owner's property for various reasons was not sufficient to show such use was adverse to the owner's interests, and the neighbors'use of the owner's driveway did not commence until 2005 and was discontinued in 2010 when the owner put up the pipe fence and a locked gate, which time fell short of the seven-year period required to obtain an easement by prescription.Kelley v. Williams, 2015 Ark. App. 609, 474 S.W.3d 884 (2015).
         </p>
         <p>
          Mere ignorance of the existence of a cause does not prevent the running of the statute of limitations. Hibben v. Malone, 85 Ark. 584, 109 S.W. 1008 (1908).
         </p>
         <p>
          The statute of limitations will not run in favor of parties to a forged deed until a discovery of the forgery by the true owners of the land. Walden v. Blassingame, 130 Ark. 448, 197 S.W. 1170 (1917).
         </p>
         <p>
          The statute of limitations does not run against the grantee of land until he knows of the existence of a deed in his favor, where the deed was intentionally withheld from him by the party holding possession of the land. Peters v. Priest, 134 Ark. 161, 203 S.W. 1042 (1918).
         </p>
         <p>
          Mere ignorance on the part of a cotenant concerning her right to land adversely occupied by another tenant or even a joint mistake of law on the part of both cotenants as to their respective rights to the land did not affect the running of the statute of limitations under which title by adverse possession is claimed, the mistake not being caused by fraudulent concealment or misrepresentation. McKinney v. Beattie, 157 Ark. 356, 248 S.W. 280 (1923).
         </p>
         <p>
          Mere ignorance of one's rights does not prevent the running of the statute of limitations or laches against him unless the ignorance is due to the fraudulent concealment or misrepresentations on the part of those invoking the benefit of the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches. Landman v. Fincher, 196 Ark. 609, 119 S.W.2d 521 (1938).
         </p>
         <p>
          This statute of limitations was suspended in wartime. Metropolitan Nat'l Bank v. Gordon, 28 Ark. 115 (1872); Eidins v. Graddy, 28 Ark. 500 (1873); Hall v. Denckla, 28 Ark. 506 (1873), overruled, Whittington v. Flint, 43 Ark. 504 (1884); Worthington v. De Bardlekin, 33 Ark. 651 (1878).
         </p>
         <p>
          This statute of limitations does not run while the title to land is in the United States. Nichols v. Council, 51 Ark. 26, 9 S.W. 305 (1888).
         </p>
         <p>
          The statute of limitations does not run against claims existing between husband and wife during the continuance of marital relations. Hamby v. Brooks, 86 Ark. 448, 111 S.W. 277 (1908).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where, after a suit to quiet title was begun, the parties agreed to let the ownership abide the decision of the United States Department of the Interior, the agreement operated to prevent the running of statute of limitations till the decision of the United States Department of the Interior was made and the plaintiff's action brought within time thereafter was not barred. Webb v. Spann, 157 Ark. 328, 248 S.W. 285 (1923).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where adverse possessor took possession of land under an agreement entitling him to do so in the lifetime of the original owner, this adverse holding put the statute of limitations in motion against him and its running was not arrested by his death. Arnold v. Arnold, 193 Ark. 109, 97 S.W.2d 634 (1936).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where an absolute deed was executed to secure payment of a note and creditor accepted payment of the debt after expiration of statute of limitations, the creditor has waived the right to invoke the statute of limitations in a suit by the debtor to revest title in himself. Stebbins v. Clendenin, 136 Ark. 391, 206 S.W. 681 (1918).
         </p>
         <p>
          Because appellant never raised the statute of limitations as a defense below, the issue was waived.Osborn v. Tennison, 2014 Ark. App. 175, 434 S.W.3d 1 (2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Section 18-11-102, when coupled with this section, works to invest title in one who has paid taxes on wild and unenclosed lands for a period in excess of seven years. Broadhead v. McEntire, 19 Ark. App. 259, 720 S.W.2d 313 (1986).
         </p>
         <p>
          The purchaser of the land was not entitled to have his title confirmed by actual physical possession of the property for more than seven years, where there was evidence that he had only been on the property four or five times during the seven-year period and his other acts of possession were merely fitful, and it was stipulated by the parties that the property was wild and unimproved and not occupied by anyone. Broadhead v. McEntire, 19 Ark. App. 259, 720 S.W.2d 313 (1986).

     </p>
     <p>
      Actual possession of land under deed from the state for over four years before former owner intervened in suit to confirm state title alleging invalidity of tax sale to the state vested a good title as against any claim of ownership by former owner.

     </p>

      Where minerals were constructively severed from the soil by mineral deeds and were non-producing, it follows that there was no possession of the minerals by anyone within the purview of this section. Davis v. Stonecipher, 218 Ark. 962, 239 S.W.2d 756 (1951).
     </p>
     <p>
      In action to quiet title by purchaser at tax sale wherein defendant counterclaimed for cancellation of tax deed, this statute of limitations could have only been invoked by one in actual possession of the land. Alsobrook v. Taylor, 254 Ark. 132, 491 S.W.2d 808 (1973).
     </p>
     <p>
      Lessor owned disputed mineral interests because a 1958 tax sale of a one-half mineral interest and the accompanying tax deed were void; regardless of when the statute of limitations ran, whatever infringement occurred when the land was drilled was not sufficient to constitute notice of exclusive possession of minerals or an intent to oust the lessor due to co-ownership.SEECO, Inc. v. Holden, 2015 Ark. App. 555, 473 S.W.3d 36 (2015).

     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      This section is a statute of limitations and actual adverse possession under a tax deed from the Commissioner of State Lands vests a good title in the occupying holder of the donation certificate or deed, regardless of any defects in the tax sale under which the state acquired title. Honeycutt v. Sherrill, 207 Ark. 206, 179 S.W.2d 693 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      After purchaser held land adversely under donation for two years, his title became good by limitation and would not be divested out of him because he attempted to purchase from the holder of the record title. Honeycutt v. Sherrill, 207 Ark. 206, 179 S.W.2d 693 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where state's deed to mortgagor's son was in effect a redemption by mortgagor, possession of land by son was not adverse under this section. Lewis v. Fidelity Sav. & Trust Co., 207 Ark. 433, 181 S.W.2d 22 (1944).
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      The fact that purchaser and his grantor, who took possession of land under the deed from the state of Arkansas, held exclusive possession of lands and exercised visible and notorious acts of ownership over same, for longer than the statutory period prior to the filing of an action by the plaintiff, was sufficient to give the purchaser title. Pitts v. Johnson, 212 Ark. 119, 205 S.W.2d 449 (1947).
     </p>
     <p>
      One who took title under a void tax sale, and claimed adverse possession for more than the statutory period, was entitled to only the land which he had actually possessed. Nall v. Phillips, 213 Ark. 92, 210 S.W.2d 806 (1948).
     </p>
     <p>
      Intent to hold land adversely was not disclaimed where plaintiffs made offer to buy out defendant, if offer stated that plaintiffs were claiming title under tax deed, and were merely offering what it would take to clear title. Cook v. Langhorne, 219 Ark. 443, 242 S.W.2d 838 (1951).
     </p>
     <p>
      Tax title purchaser could not assert adverse possession as a result of the original owner's tenant having attorned to the tax title purchaser after tax sale in absence of proof that original owner had notice that tenant had attorned to such purchaser or was put on notice that the statute of limitations was running. Laney v. Monsanto Chem. Co., 233 Ark. 645, 348 S.W.2d 826 (1961).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where testimony showed no plaintiff had ever been in possession of land in question, this section applied and one holding under a state deed adversely for the statutory time had vested title regardless of a defect in the tax sale. Brown v. Masterson, 240 Ark. 880, 402 S.W.2d 666 (1966).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the record contained no evidence of notice of any kind to the heirs or their predecessor in title, the defendant's claim to title which rested wholly on a showing of adverse possession following possession by permission would fail. McDowell v. King, 266 Ark. 1005, 589 S.W.2d 594 (Ct. App. 1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section, in essence, shortens the period of limitation for the recovery of lands adversely possessed under deeds based on tax sales to two years, and two years actual adverse possession by the holder of the tax deed is required before the original owner's right to recover the land is barred. Boyd v. Meador, 10 Ark. App. 5, 660 S.W.2d 943 (1983).
     </p>
     <p>
      Plea of limitations was not available to attorney to whom some cotenants had mortgaged land to secure fee, since his purchase at tax sale of all land was in effect a redemption for the benefit of all co-tenants. Kitchens v. Wheeler, 200 Ark. 671, 141 S.W.2d 34 (1940).
     </p>
     <p>
      Conveyance of title based upon tax sale to administratrix of the person who owned the lot at the time of the sale operated as a redemption from the sale, the tax title merged into the legal title and her grantees had no tax title which could enable them to claim under the provisions of this section against heirs of the taxpayer. Hofstatter v. Bona, 205 Ark. 729, 170 S.W.2d 1016 (1943).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     The fact that this section has no saving clause in favor of infants does not preclude a minor from bringing an action to redeem a homestead from forfeiture after the limitations period as the action is saved by §§<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.16.html#t16c56s16-56-116" target="_blank">16-56-116</a></cite> and<cite class="ocar"><a href="gov.ar.code.title.26.html#t26c37s26-37-305" target="_blank">26-37-305</a></cite>. Kendrick v. Bowden, 211 Ark. 196, 199 S.W.2d 740 (1947).
     </p>
     <p>
      Since the tax title acquired by a widow amounted to a redemption, the statute of limitations on tax sales had no application, nor could a claim of adverse possession for the statutory period be anchored on the tax title. Vesper v. Woolsey, 231 Ark. 782, 332 S.W.2d 602 (1960).
     </p>
     <p>
      The statute of limitations begins to run from the expiration of the period allowed for redemption, not from the date of sale. Cairo & F.R.R. v. Parks, 32 Ark. 131 (1877).
     </p>
     <p>
      Actual possession under deed sets the statute of limitations in motion. Woolfolk v. Buckner, 67 Ark. 411, 55 S.W. 168 (1900); Hixon v. Fulks, 210 Ark. 204, 194 S.W.2d 870 (1946).

     </p>

     </p>
     <p>

Laney v. Monsanto Chem. Co., 233 Ark. 645, 348 S.W.2d 826 (1961).
     </p>

     </p>

     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      A purchaser of land who has been in possession of the land under a tax deed for more than the statutory period acquires title, regardless of the validity of the tax sale. Black v.

     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
     Debtor who was in possession of the property at issue and who claimed an equitable interest in the property was entitled to challenge the quiet title action asserted by the subsequent purchaser, after that purchaser bought the property in a tax sale and sought to quiet title under §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c60s18-60-601" target="_self">18-60-601</a></cite>, because the debtor had alleged an equitable interest in the property and the debtor had not received notice of the tax sale. Debtor's claim was not barred by the statute of limitations set forth in §<cite class="ocar"><a href="#t18c61s18-61-106" target="_self">18-61-106</a></cite>.In re Paro, 362 B.R. 419 (Bankr. E.D. Ark. 2007).

     </p>
     <p>
      Where tax sale was void because notice did not contain sufficient description, but deed of the Commissioner of State Lands correctly described a portion of the land sold under the void description and there was possession under the donation certificate and deed of more than the statutory period, the donee was protected by this section.

     </p>
     <p>
      Tax deed covering sale of mineral interests in certain described land was void where mineral interests in assessment book were indexed alphabetically instead of by land description. Davis v. Stonecipher, 218 Ark. 962, 239 S.W.2d 756 (1951).

     </p>
     <p>
      Deeds to land by the state, though based on void sales, constitute color of title, and actual possession under color of title will bar the owner from maintaining a suit for its recovery unless the suit was brought within statutory time limit.

     </p>
     <p>

Burns, 140 Ark. 367, 215 S.W. 618 (1919); Goodrich v. Darr, 161 Ark. 514, 256 S.W. 868 (1923); Liggett v. Church of Nazarene, 291 Ark. 298, 724 S.W.2d 170 (1987).
