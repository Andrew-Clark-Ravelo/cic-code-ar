Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Seventh General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the appropriation of funds for more than a two (2) year period; that the effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 1989 is essential to the operation of the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in the event of an extension of the Regular Session, the delay in the effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 1989 could work irreparable harm upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1989.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 1993, No. 860, § 38: Apr. 2, 1993. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Ninth General Assembly, that payees listed in this Act may be entitled to the sums appropriated and transferred to herein, and that they have been deprived of the use of these funds for a long period of time, and that further delay in paying these just debts of the State would do harm to the reputation of the State of Arkansas. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

   Because former employee's claims for injunctive relief were unquestionably legal claims against the State of Arkansas, sovereign immunity barred his claims under the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-601" target="_self">21-1-601</a></cite> et seq., and the state and federal constitutions against the state officials in their official capacities; and plaintiff's conclusory statements and bare allegations were insufficient to establish an illegal, unconstitutional, or ultra vires act such that sovereign immunity would not apply.Harris v.

       Arkansas Governor did not waive sovereign immunity by signing the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act because the governor does not enact legislation.Harris v. Hutchinson, 2020 Ark. 3, 591 S.W.3d 778 (2020).

        Amendments. The 2005 amendment deleted “county board of education or a” in (5)(E) and made minor stylistic changes.

<p>
        The 2013 amendment rewrote (4).

<p>
        The 2019 amendment substituted “rule” for “regulation” in (6).
       </p>
<p>
        Because the circuit court previously ruled that the employee violated multiple rules and policies, it was clear that his termination was the result of that misconduct and not related to any communication between the employee and the city administrator; that previous ruling did, in fact, establish the city's affirmative defense to the whistle-blower claim.Barrows v. City of Fort Smith, 2010 Ark. 73, 360 S.W.3d 117 (2010).
       </p>
<p>
        There were no undisputed facts that warranted proceeding to a jury trial; the circuit court determined as a matter of law that the city had an affirmative defense to the employee's whistle-blower claim in that his termination was the result of his violating departmental rules and policies. As the circuit court reasoned, the employee should not be allowed to force the city to prove that misconduct yet again.Barrows v. City of Fort Smith, 2010 Ark. 73, 360 S.W.3d 117 (2010).
       </p>
<p>
        There was sufficient evidence that the employee was a public employee, because the employee was a person, and it was undisputed that he performed part-time services in exchange for wages from the Arkansas Department of Career Education, a public employer.State v. Means, 2013 Ark. 173, 426 S.W.3d 922 (2013).
       </p>
<p>
        In the nurse's action under the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act, the trial court did not err by denying the motion for summary judgment of the Administrator of the Arkansas State Hospital and its employee based on sovereign immunity because the suit against the Administrator in his official capacity was in effect a suit against a public employer for which sovereign immunity was waived by this section.Smith v. Daniel, 2014 Ark. 519, 452 S.W.3d 575 (2014).
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
     Per the holding in Board of Trustees v. Andrews, 2018 Ark. 12, to the extent the legislature subjected the State to liability in the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-601" target="_self">21-1-601</a></cite> et seq., it is prohibited by Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 20, and the circuit court erred when it denied defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings based on sovereign immunity.The General Assembly’s choice to abrogate sovereign immunity in the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act is prohibited by the Arkansas Constitution.Ark. Cmty. Corr. v. Barnes, 2018 Ark. 122, 542 S.W.3d 841 (2018).
       </p>
<p>
        Law professor's Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act (AWBA) individual-capacity claims against state university officials were properly dismissed because the AWBA does not provide for suits against individuals.Steinbuch v. Univ. of Ark., 2019 Ark. 356, 589 S.W.3d 350 (2019).
       </p>
<p>
        Because terminated county employee's actions of reporting alleged misdeeds to quorum court members, sitting as a grievance committee, was reporting to the “appropriate authorities,” under subdivision (2)(A)(ii) of this section, evidence supporting terminated employee's claim under the Whistle-Blower Act created a question of fact and, thus, it was error for the trial court to have granted the county's motion for a directed verdict. Crawford County v. Jones, 365 Ark. 585, 232 S.W.3d 433 (2006).
       </p>

        Bullying and harassment do not amount to either a waste of public funds or a violation of the law for purposes of the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act. Bales v. City of Fort Smith, 2016 Ark. App. 491 (2016) (substituted op. on reh'g).

        Because the circuit court previously ruled that the employee violated multiple rules and policies, it was clear that his termination was the result of that misconduct and not related to any communication between the employee and the city administrator; that previous ruling did, in fact, establish the city's affirmative defense to the whistle-blower claim.Barrows v. City of Fort Smith, 2010 Ark. 73, 360 S.W.3d 117 (2010).

<p>
      A public employee who alleges a violation of this subchapter may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or actual damages, or both, within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the occurrence of the alleged violation of this subchapter.
     </p>
<p>
      An action commenced under this section may be brought in the circuit court for the county where the alleged violation occurred, for the county where the complainant resides, or in the Pulaski County Circuit Court if the complaint is filed against an agency, department, or institution of state government.
     </p>
<p>
      To prevail in an action brought under the authority of this section, the public employee shall establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employee has suffered an adverse action because the employee or a person acting on his or her behalf engaged or intended to engage in an activity protected under this subchapter.
     </p>
<p>
      As used in this section, “damages” means damages for a job-related injury or loss caused by each violation of this subchapter, including, but not limited to, fringe benefits, retirement service credit, compensation for lost wages, benefits, and any other remuneration, and reasonable court costs and attorney's fees.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (1)A public employer shall have an affirmative defense to a civil action brought by a public employee under this subchapter if the adverse action taken against a public employee was due to employee misconduct, poor job performance, or a reduction in workforce unrelated to a communication made pursuant to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-603" target="_self">21-1-603</a></cite>.

          Effective Dates. Acts 1995, No. 339, § 5: Feb. 16, 1995. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that financial audits of governmental entities covered by the Self-Insured Fidelity Bond Program are necessary to maintain financial stability of the Self-Insured Fidelity Bond Program. This act is designed to accomplish this purpose for governmental entities or subdivisions thereof participating in the Program which are not audited by Arkansas Legislative Audit; and this act should be given effect immediately. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

<p>
          Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governer, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Eighty-third General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that Arkansas Code 21-2-704 refers to the term ‘participating governmental entities’ as one defined in Arkansas Code 21-2-702 but there is no definition for this term in that section, and this causes confusion, hinders the operation of the Governmental Bonding Board and creates uncertainty in how the term is interpreted that can be avoided by defining the term. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after the date of its passage and approval. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

          Acts 2005, No. 506, § 54: Mar. 2, 2005. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the laws of this state as to insurance regulation and the Governmental Bonding Board, among others, are inadequate for the protection of the public, and the immediate passage of this act is necessary in order to provide for the adequate protection of the public. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

          Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

          Although an employee can continue to work beyond the attainment of age 70 if he receives written authorization from the chief administrative officer, the chief administrative officer is not required to give written authorization. Because written authorization is entirely within the discretion of the chief administrative officer, it cannot be said that an employee has a protectable property interest in his continued employment.

      (1)Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prohibit compulsory retirement of any employee who has attained sixty-five (65) years of age, and who, for the two-year period immediately before retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or a high policy-making position if the employee is entitled to an immediate nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit from a pension, savings, or deferred compensation plan, or any combination of such plans, of the employer of the employee, which equals, in the aggregate, at least forty-four thousand dollars ($44,000).
     </p>
<p>
      In applying the retirement benefit test of subdivision (a)(1) of this section, if any such retirement benefit is in a form other than a straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits, or if employees contribute to any such plan or make rollover contributions, that benefit shall be adjusted by the actuary of the employee's public retirement system, so that the benefit is the equivalent of a straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions are made.

      Recognizing the tremendous potential represented by the young people attending Arkansas institutions of higher education, and in due consideration of the great interest of the people of the State of Arkansas in retaining graduates of Arkansas institutions of higher education within the state, with the further conviction that it is in the best interest of all citizens of the state to recruit and retain qualified college graduates within the State of Arkansas government system, and recognizing the great contribution to the educational process that learning experiences within state government can provide, the General Assembly finds and declares that an affirmative effort to provide college students with employment opportunities within state government is important to the welfare and security of this state and nation and, consequently, is an important public service.
     </p>

          Publisher's Notes. This section, concerning military leave of absence for chancery court judges, was repealed by Acts 2003, No. 1185, § 258. The section was derived from Acts 1943, No. 247, § 7; A.S.A. 1947, § 12-2307.

<p>
          This section amended the previous civil service act and was retroactive, so that city ordinance of 1942 providing for retention of civil service status of all municipal employees while in the armed services was valid. Smith v. Little Rock Civil Serv. Comm'n, 214 Ark. 765, 218 S.W.2d 366 (1949).
         </p>
<p>
          Policeman who was at head of list when he entered service was entitled to be restored to position on list on return from service, as court must consider federal, state, and municipal legislation in passing on rights of public employee as returning serviceman. Smith v. Little Rock Civil Serv. Comm'n, 214 Ark. 765, 218 S.W.2d 366 (1949).

          This section undertook to preserve status of both public officers and public employees who entered the armed services. Smith v. Little Rock Civil Serv. Comm'n, 214 Ark. 765, 218 S.W.2d 366 (1949).
         </p>
<p>
          Where city ordinance provided that all appointments to municipal grades were to be considered temporary until six months after termination of emergency by the President of the United States, all appointments would still be temporary until such declaration by the President although hostilities had ceased, but court could not require new examinations for permanent positions until the city council set up machinery for procedure.

       21-5-209. Compensation plan.
      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      There is established for state agencies covered by this subchapter a compensation plan for the setting of salaries and salary increases, when deserved, of all employees serving in positions covered by this subchapter.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)No employee shall be paid at a rate of pay higher than the maximum pay level in the grade assigned to his or her class unless otherwise provided for in this subchapter.
     </p>
<p>
      However, an employee presently employed in a position who is being paid at a rate in excess of the maximum for his or her assigned grade may continue to receive his or her rate of pay.
     </p>
<p>
      It is the specific intent of the General Assembly to authorize, in the enactment of the compensation plans, rates of pay for each of the appropriate grades assigned to a class, but it is not the intent that any pay increases shall be automatic or that any employee shall have a claim or a right to pay increases unless the department head of the state agency determines that the employee, by experience, ability, and work performance, is eligible for the increase in pay authorized for the appropriate rate.

       21-5-211. Implementation procedure for grade changes — Salary adjustments.
      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      The Office of Personnel Management has administrative responsibility for enforcing compliance by state agencies affected by this subchapter in implementing classification and grade changes.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)The Governor may authorize a salary increase up to two percent (2%) each fiscal year if:
     </p>
<p>
      The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and Shared Services determine that sufficient general revenues become available; and
     </p>
<p>
      The salary increase does not result in an employee's compensation exceeding the maximum pay level amount set out for the position.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)An employee compensated at the highest pay level rate authorized for his or her classification is eligible to receive the salary increase authorized in this section as a lump-sum payment.
     </p>
<p>
      However, the increase shall be paid as a lump sum on the last pay period of the fiscal year of the year in which the increase is to occur, and the payment shall not be construed as exceeding the maximum salary.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)If the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and the secretary determine that general revenue funds are insufficient to implement the salary increases authorized in this subchapter or by any other law that affects salary increases for state employees, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and the secretary upon approval by the Governor may reduce the percentage of all authorized salary increases for all state employees covered by this subchapter without regard to whether or not the employees are compensated from general or special revenues, federal funds, or trust funds.
     </p>
<p>
      However, if sufficient general revenues should then become available at any time during the year to provide the maximum additional salary increases for all state employees without regard to the source of revenues, salary increases for state employees provided for in this subchapter or by any other law may be fully implemented by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and the secretary.
     </p>
<p>
      Any salary adjustments made by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and the secretary in accordance with this subsection shall be reported to the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee.
     </p>
<p>
      All percentage calculations stipulated in this subchapter or any other law affecting salaries of state employees may be rounded to the nearest even-dollar amount by the Office of Personnel Management when making the percentage changes to state employee salaries.

</h3>
<p>
      A new appointment to a position in a state agency covered by this subchapter shall be paid at the entry pay level for the grade assigned to the classification unless otherwise authorized by law.
     </p>
<p>
      Special rates of pay may be established for either classifications or positions for the following reasons:
     </p>
<p>
      (1)A state agency may request a special rate of pay for a specific classification or position due to prevailing market rates of pay up to the midpoint pay level of the appropriate grade of a classification on the appropriate pay table for the assigned grade with the written approval of the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and Shared Services.
     </p>
<p>
      A state agency may request a special rate of pay for a specific classification or position due to prevailing market rates of pay up to the maximum pay level for the assigned grade only with the approval of the secretary after review by the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee.
     </p>
<p>
      The Office of Personnel Management shall maintain a register of classifications or positions for which special rates of pay have been established due to prevailing market rates of pay.
     </p>
<p>
      The office shall file a report of special rates of pay established due to prevailing market rates of pay with the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, at the next regularly scheduled meeting following the approval.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)A special rate of pay may be established for an exceptionally well-qualified applicant whose educational background or experience qualifies the applicant to perform the job with little or substantially less orientation and training than would be required for another qualified applicant.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)An agency director may approve a special rate of pay under subdivision (d)(1) of this section up to fifteen percent (15%) above the entry pay level for the grade assigned to the classification and shall report all actions under the office’s procedures.

<p>
            “(1)The health insurance program provided by the State and Public School Life and Health Insurance Board for public school employees and public school employee retirees is in a state of crisis;

       21-5-221. Compensation differentials.
      </b>
</h3>
<p>
      To address specific employee compensation needs not otherwise provided for in this subchapter, a state agency may pay additional compensation for current employees in specific positions or for classifications of positions assigned to a compensation plan authorized by the General Assembly for one (1) or more compensation differentials.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)Authorization for one (1) or more compensation differentials may be approved if the:
     </p>
<p>
      State agency has documented the need for a compensation differential for specified positions or classifications;
     </p>
<p>
      State agency submits to the Office of Personnel Management a plan of the terms and conditions for eligibility that must directly address the needs of the targeted positions or classifications for any requested compensation differential;
     </p>
<p>
      Cost of implementing and maintaining a compensation differential is within the state agency's existing appropriation and shall not be implemented using funds specifically set aside for other programs within the state agency; and
     </p>
<p>
      Compensation differential plan has been approved by the Office of Personnel Management after review by the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee.
     </p>
<p>
      Any compensation differential authorized under this section shall be renewed each fiscal year.
     </p>
<p>
      The cumulative total of any compensation differentials paid to an employee shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the employee's base salary.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)Hazardous duty differential of up to ten percent (10%) may be authorized for the increased risk of personal physical injury for an employee occupying a certain identified high-risk position if the:
     </p>
<p>
      Position classification is determined to be physically hazardous or dangerous due to location, facility, services provided, or other factors directly related to the duty assignment of the positions; and
     </p>
<p>
      Employee's regularly assigned work schedule exposes him or her to clear, direct, and unavoidable hazards during at least fifty percent (50%) of the work time and the employee is not compensated for the hazardous exposure.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)The director of the requesting state agency shall identify the facility or unit, location, and eligible positions and classifications within the facility or unit that are identified as high-risk.
     </p>
<p>
      The positions shall be certified by the state agency director as having been assigned to a work environment that poses an increased risk of personal injury and shall be submitted as part of the plan for payment of hazardous duty differential to the Office of Personnel Management for approval by the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and Shared Services in consultation with the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State after review and approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee.
     </p>
<p>
      Subsequent changes to the facility or unit, location, and eligible positions or classifications within the facility or unit on file with the Office of Personnel Management shall receive prior approval by the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and Shared Services after review and approval by the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee.
     </p>
<p>
      It is the intent of this subsection that hazardous duty compensation shall be at the discretion of the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and Shared Services and the director of the state agency and shall not be implemented using funds specifically set aside for other programs within the state agency.
     </p>
<p>
      An additional ten percent (10%), but not to exceed a total of twelve percent (12%), hazardous duty differential may be authorized for employees occupying positions assigned to a maximum security unit or facility if the regularly assigned work schedules expose employees at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the work time to clear, direct, and unavoidable hazards from clients, inmates, or patients who are in units or facilities that are classified as maximum security.

      (1)If qualified, state employee retirees and public school employee retirees may continue coverage and participate in the State and Public School Life and Health Insurance Program if the state employee retirees or public school employee retirees are:
     </p>
<p>
      The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System;
     </p>
<p>
      The Arkansas State Highway Employees' Retirement System;
     </p>
<p>
      The Arkansas Judicial Retirement System; or
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   An alternate retirement plan of a qualifying institution under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.24.html#t24c07s24-7-801" target="_blank">24-7-801</a></cite>; and
     </p>
<p>
      Retired and drawing benefits under one (1) or more of the retirement systems listed under subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)(i)If a state employee retiree or a public school employee retiree who is a member of a retirement system listed under subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section receives retirement benefits, thereby becoming an active retiree, the active retiree may elect to enroll in the program.
     </p>
<p>
      The election to enroll in the program shall be made within thirty (30) days of the state employee retiree's or public school employee retiree's becoming an active retiree and shall be made in writing to the Employee Benefits Division on forms required by the division.
     </p>
<p>
      (i)To be eligible to continue coverage or to qualify for coverage after electing to decline participation in the program, the retiree must have been covered on the last day of the retiree's employment.
     </p>
<p>
      If a retiree declines to participate in the program at the time of retirement because the retiree is already covered under another employer-sponsored group health insurance policy, the retiree may make a one-time election to participate in the program with proof of continued insurance coverage at the time of open enrollment or if the retiree experiences a qualifying event.
     </p>
<p>
      (i)Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2)(C)(ii) of this section, an active retiree's failure to make an election to participate in the program during the thirty-day election period or an active retiree's election to decline participation in the program is final.
     </p>
<p>
      If an active retiree declines participation in the program because the active retiree has health insurance coverage through another employer group health plan and the active retiree's coverage was subsequently terminated because of a loss of eligibility, as defined by Internal Revenue Service regulations, and provides information from the former insurance company of the loss of eligibility, then the active retiree shall qualify for participation in the program upon payment of the appropriate premium as determined by the State and Public School Life and Health Insurance Board under subdivision (a)(5) of this section if the active retiree applies for participation in the program within thirty (30) days of the loss of eligibility.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this section, a state employee or public school employee with ten (10) or more years of creditable service under the terms of a retirement plan listed in this section shall qualify for continued participation in the program if the state employee or public school employee is separated from employment because of the expiration of a fixed period of employment.
     </p>
<p>
      (i)A state employee or public school employee qualifying for continued participation in the program under this subsection shall be considered an inactive retiree and shall have thirty-one (31) days from the effective date of termination to elect to continue participation in the program under this section by notifying the division.
     </p>
<p>
      The election to continue participation in the program shall be made in writing on forms required by the division.
     </p>
<p>
      (i)Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2)(B)(ii) of this section, an inactive retiree's failure to elect to continue participation in the program during the thirty-day election period or an inactive retiree's election to decline participation in the program is final.
     </p>
<p>
      If an inactive retiree as described in subdivision (a)(3)(B) of this section declines participation in the program because the inactive retiree has health insurance coverage through another employer-sponsored group health plan and the inactive retiree's coverage is subsequently terminated because of a loss of eligibility, then the inactive retiree and any dependents shall qualify for participation in the program if, within thirty (30) days of the inactive retiree's involuntary loss of coverage, the inactive retiree submits to the board:
     </p>
<p>
      Payment of the appropriate premium as determined by the board under subdivision (a)(5) of this section; and
     </p>
<p>
      Proof that, until the inactive retiree's involuntary loss of coverage through another employer-sponsored group health plan, the coverage had been continuous.
     </p>
<p>
      An eligible inactive retiree shall be reclassified as an active retiree upon electing to receive a retirement benefit by a retirement system listed under subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section and shall be charged the premium rate appropriate for his or her rating category as an active retiree as determined by the board under subdivision (a)(5) of this section.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)As used in this subsection, “loss of eligibility” means a loss of coverage as a result of:
     </p>
<p>
      A legal separation;
     </p>
<p>

         The 1979 amendment to this section, which deleted a portion prohibiting judicial review in an action of the Workers' Compensation Commission with respect to a claim by a municipal employee, was a procedural one affecting the manner in which one could enforce the substantive rights conferred on claimants and employers under the Workers' Compensation Act and, thus, did not violate the prohibition under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.01.html#t01c02s1-2-120" target="_blank">1-2-120</a></cite> against changes in substantial rights. Office of Emergency Servs. v. Home Ins. Co., 2 Ark. App. 185, 618 S.W.2d 573 (1981).
           </p>
<p>
            Where the claimant filed a petition for rehearing of the denial of disability benefits on the ground that there was newly discovered evidence, but it appeared that all of the evidence which he claimed was newly discovered was actually within his knowledge before the case was originally submitted to and decided by the commission, the motion for a rehearing was properly denied. Walker v. J &amp; J Pest Control, 6 Ark. App. 171, 639 S.W.2d 748 (1982).
           </p>
<p>
            Inasmuch as the commission must reconsider “any compensation order, award or decision,” on its own motion or upon application of any interested party and “upon such review may make an order or award terminating, continuing, decreasing or increasing for the future the compensation previously awarded,” due process of law dictates that an employee who has been denied benefits should be afforded the same opportunity to have his claim reconsidered where he has discovered subsequently to the denial of benefits that he has a meritorious claim. Walker v. J &amp; J Pest Control, 270 Ark. 941, 606 S.W.2d 597 (1980).
           </p>
<p>
            Where a city was covered by a private workers' compensation policy, but failed to furnish a copy to the Workers' Compensation Commission by a specified date, two widows of city policemen were entitled to coverage from both the private plan and the municipal aid fund under this section since this section automatically extends state fund coverage to city employees in workers' compensation cases unless there is strict compliance with all the exclusionary provisions of the fund act; the failure of the city to strictly comply with the fund act's exclusionary provisions mandates a finding of coincidental or dual coverage and, consequently, dual liability. City of Waldo v. Poetker, 3 Ark. App. 12, 621 S.W.2d 491 (1981), aff'd, 275 Ark. 216, 628 S.W.2d 329 (1982).

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

     </p>
<p>
      Proof of total and permanent disability shall be established by offering evidence that the covered public employee was unable to work in the employment position covered by this subchapter for a period of more than one (1) year or that the covered public employee received a disability rating in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) from the Workers' Compensation Commission.

      Arkansas Constitution, Article 16, § 4, provides: “The General Assembly shall fix the salaries and fees of all officers in the State, and no greater salary or fee than that fixed by law shall be paid to any officer, employee or other person, or at any rate other than par value; and the number and salaries of the clerks and employees of the different departments of the State shall be fixed by law.” Therefore, the following provisions are applicable to all authorized regular salary positions in appropriation acts unless specific exception is made otherwise by law:

<li id="t21c05s21-5-1403ol13B">
         It is not the intent of the General Assembly that the maximum annual salaries as authorized in the appropriation act or pay increases established for the various grades under this subchapter be paid unless the employee meets the qualifications associated with each pay level and then only within the limitations of the appropriations and funds available for that purpose.
        </li>
<li id="t21c05s21-5-1403ol13C">
         An employee authorized by the General Assembly shall not receive from appropriated or cash funds, either from state, federal, or other sources, compensation in an amount greater than that established by the General Assembly as the maximum annual salary for the employee, unless specific provisions are made by law; and

<p>
      The Division of Higher Education has administrative responsibility for enforcing compliance by institutions of higher education affected by this subchapter in implementing classification and grade changes.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)The rate of compensation an employee shall receive on July 1, 2019, is an increase of one percent (1%) above the employee's current salary.
     </p>
<p>
      An employee whose adjusted annual salary falls below the entry pay level for the grade assigned to his or her classification shall be further adjusted to the entry pay level.
     </p>
<p>
      The salary increase authorized by subdivision (b)(1) of this section may allow an employee's compensation to exceed the maximum pay level amount set out for the position.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)In addition to the compensation increase under subsection (b) of this section, the maximum annual salary for which an employee covered by this subchapter is eligible on July 1, 2019, may be increased:
     </p>
<p>
      By a percentage up to two percent (2%) with written approval by the Director of the Division of Higher Education; or
     </p>
<p>
      More than two percent (2%) only with written approval of the director after review by the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee.
     </p>
<p>
      The salary increase may be established as an increase to the employee's salary or as a lump sum.
     </p>
<p>
      An employee compensated at the highest pay level rate authorized for his or her classification is eligible to receive the salary increase authorized in this section as a lump sum payment.
     </p>
<p>
      Salary adjustments made by the director under this section shall be reported to the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee.
     </p>
<p>
      All percentage calculations stipulated in this subchapter or any other law affecting salaries of employees of institutions of higher education may be rounded to the nearest even-dollar amount by the division when making the increases to employee salaries as provided under subdivision (c)(1) of this section.

       If an officer takes a fee not authorized by law under the belief that he is by law entitled to it and without any corrupt intent in the matter, he is not guilty of extortion. Leeman v. State, 35 Ark. 438 (1880).

<p>
       As a prerequisite to liability, there must be a finding of fact that officer acted corruptly with bad motive or evil intent. McCourtney v. Morrow, 216 Ark. 959, 229 S.W.2d 124 (1950).

<p>
       It is sufficient averment of a corrupt intent in an indictment for extortion to allege that the defendant “extorsively” took the unlawful fee. Leeman v. State, 35 Ark. 438 (1880).
      </p>
<p>
       An indictment of a road commissioner of a road improvement district for extortion in receiving money for services not performed was fatally defective in failing to allege that the money was received corruptly and under color of office. Hood v. State, 156 Ark. 92, 245 S.W. 176 (1922).

       An officer is not entitled to fees for every specific act done by him officially; rather, can only collect where the law makes provision to pay him. Crittenden County v. Crump, 25 Ark. 235 (1868).
      </p>
<p>
       Where the compensation of an officer is regulated by fees, he can only demand those authorized by law and cannot charge for a particular service for which no special fee is provided, unless there is a general provision of law covering all services not specially provided for; such a general provision would not embrace services for the state or a county, unless they are expressly named or necessarily implied. Standford v. Wheeler, 28 Ark. 144 (1873); Cole v. White County, 32 Ark. 45 (1877).
      </p>
<p>
       The county court is absolutely prohibited from allowing to any officer any fee or allowance not specifically allowed the officer by law, nor can it allow any officer constructive fees. Trimble v. St. Louis &amp; S.F. Ry., 56 Ark. 249, 19 S.W. 839 (1892); Logan County v. Trimm, 57 Ark. 487, 22 S.W. 164 (1893).
      </p>
<p>
       To authorize a county court to allow a claim of fees for services rendered by an officer, three things must concur: (1) There must be a specific statutory authority to the officer to make a charge for the service; (2) The officer must be required by the statute, or by the rules of practice or order of the court, to perform the service; and (3) The statute must indicate, expressly or by fair intendment, the intention to permit the fee allowed by the statute for the service to be charged against the county.

        This section does not purport to be a salary act or other compensatory act for county treasurers, but it was intended to create a source of revenue accruing to that office from which the salary of the incumbent could be paid. Howard v. Stafford, 203 Ark. 736, 158 S.W.2d 929 (1942).
       </p>
<p>
        This section repealed Acts 1939, No. 146, but not any other act, either legislative or initiative, fixing the salaries of county treasurers. Howard v. Stafford, 203 Ark. 736, 158 S.W.2d 929 (1942).
       </p>
<p>
        This section contemplated the allowance of fees on all county revenue but not upon funds belonging to a drainage district. Honey v. Greene County, 102 Ark. 106, 143 S.W. 592 (1912) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
<p>
        The county treasurer's salary is fixed in amount by the total of the county funds coming into his hands, but in the settlement of the salary each fund contributes its own proportion and pays in its own kind. Hodges v. Prairie County, 80 Ark. 62, 95 S.W. 988 (1906) (decision under prior law).
       </p>
<p>
        The county treasurer is not entitled to a commission on sales of bonds of a drainage district. Fuller v. State, 112 Ark. 91, 164 S.W. 770 (1914) (decision under prior law).

Since that time a comprehensive system has been bid and purchased, redesigned for maximum use in Arkansas courts, and implemented in a number of pilot courts in the state. The system is now completed and scheduled for distribution and use by all of the courts in the state.

         Filing an appeal from municipal court is “initiating a cause of action” in the circuit court under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c06s21-6-403" target="_self">21-6-403</a></cite> so that an advance fee must be paid under this section. Neeley v. Barber, 288 Ark. 384, 706 S.W.2d 358 (1986).
           </p>
<p>
            The filing fee charged for appealing to the circuit court is collected no matter whether the defendant is tried by a jury or by the judge or even if the prosecution ends without any trial at all. Neeley v. Barber, 288 Ark. 384, 706 S.W.2d 358 (1986).

<p>
            The circuit clerk was not entitled to any fee for a certificate of attendance to jury commissioners. Logan County v. Trimm, 57 Ark. 487, 22 S.W. 164 (1893) (decision under prior law).

Therefore, a circuit court erred when it refused to refund a $3.00 fee charged by a bailiff for potential juror information in a criminal case.Aikens v. State, 368 Ark. 641, 249 S.W.3d 788 (2007).
           </p>
<p>
            The circuit clerk was entitled to his fee for every record entry indexed. Trimble v. St. Louis &amp; S.F. Ry., 56 Ark. 249, 19 S.W. 839 (1892) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
<p>
            The county was liable to circuit clerk for the fee provided in this section for swearing and entering the regular panels of grand and petit jurors and for the fee in all criminal cases in which the county was chargeable with the costs for service in entering and swearing the jury in such case. Logan County v. Trimm, 57 Ark. 487, 22 S.W. 164 (1893) (decision under prior law). See McDonald v. Logan County, 55 Ark. 577, 18 S.W. 1047 (1892) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
<p>
            The circuit clerk was entitled to a fee for swearing jurors on their voir dire and witnesses to their attendance and, if the county was liable for the costs of the case, those fees were properly chargeable to it. Logan County v. Trimm, 57 Ark. 487, 22 S.W. 164 (1893) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
<p>
            While the county was liable for the clerk's fee for oaths administered to regular jurors, if a juror was called for a particular case, the oaths administered to him were chargeable to the case. Logan County v. Trimm, 57 Ark. 487, 22 S.W. 164 (1893) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
<p>
            When court ordered summons issued for jury commissioners, the clerk could charge the same to county as for summons. Logan County v. Trimm, 57 Ark. 487, 22 S.W. 164 (1893) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
<p>
            The circuit clerk was entitled to his fee for copies of order of court appointing jury commissioners, chargeable to the county. Logan County v. Trimm, 57 Ark. 487, 22 S.W. 164 (1893) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
<p>
            The clerk was entitled to a fee for entering every order with reference to the grand and petit juries, to be paid by the county. Logan County v. Trimm, 57 Ark. 487, 22 S.W. 164 (1893) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
<p>
            In suit to foreclose and enforce lien for delinquent improvement taxes where clerk signed, sealed, and delivered to the sheriff numerous summonses, clerk and stenographer were each entitled to a fee for each summons, and the fact that they were printed made no difference. Sebastian Bridge Dist. v. Lynch, 200 Ark. 134, 138 S.W.2d 81 (1940) (decision under prior law).
           </p>
<p>
            Decree allowing fees of clerk and stenographer for summons which had been constructively served and disallowing fees for those personally served was unauthorized, since the fee was not dependent upon manner in which sheriff served the summons. Sebastian Bridge Dist. v. Lynch, 200 Ark. 134, 138 S.W.2d 81 (1940) (decision under prior law).

            Where the attorney in the case had the transcript typewritten, gave it to the clerk of court, who checked, corrected, and certified to it, this constituted making and preparing by the clerk within the meaning of this section. McCourtney v. Morrow, 216 Ark. 959, 229 S.W.2d 124 (1950).

<p>
       Where the sheriff, on execution, levied against several mobile homes and stored them on land of petitioners, who thereafter filed a motion to tax as costs of the original action the value of the storage and asked that it be assessed against the sheriff, the sheriff was entitled to protection of this section and a default judgment against him on contract theory was improper without notice to him.

<p>
       Where landowner orally contracted with sheriff to store levied goods and later filed a motion to tax storage rent as costs against both the plaintiff and sheriff, it was error for the court to grant severance of claim against sheriff, to entertain action in contract, and to enter default judgment against sheriff since the motion to sever created a new and independent cause of action.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly that various provisions of the Arkansas Code relating to campaign financing and ethics are vague or otherwise in need of modification; that this act accomplishes those purposes; and that this act should go into effect as soon as possible so that those persons who are subject to the provisions of the various ethics and campaign finance statutes receive the benefit of the clarifications as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

      Acts 2001, No. 1839, § 35: became law without governor's signature. Approved Apr. 20, 2001. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly that various provisions of the Arkansas Code relating to campaign financing and ethics are vague or otherwise in need of modification; that this act accomplishes those purposes; and that this act should go into effect as soon as possible so that those persons who are subject to the provisions of the various ethics and campaign finance statutes receive the benefit of the clarifications as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

<p>
      The State of Arkansas shall pay actual, but not punitive, damages adjudged by a state or federal court, or entered by such a court as a result of a compromise settlement approved and recommended by the Attorney General, against officers or employees of the State of Arkansas, or against the estate of such an officer or employee, based on an act or omission by the officer or employee while acting without malice and in good faith within the course and scope of his or her employment and in the performance of his or her official duties.
     </p>
<p>
</p><p>
   (1)(A)When it has been determined by the Attorney General's office that a conflict of interest for the civil litigation division or any division of the Attorney General's office exists and that therefore the Attorney General's office must decline representation of the officer or employee, the state agency for which the officer or employee is employed is authorized to enter into a contract to hire special counsel to represent the officer or employee under the same conditions that are set out under the provisions of this subchapter and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c09s21-9-304" target="_self">21-9-304</a></cite>.
     </p>
<p>
      The agency will be responsible for the payment of the contract with funds from its maintenance and general operation accounts.
     </p>
<p>
      When situations arise in which the Attorney General feels that a conflict of interest exists and therefore must decline representation of the officer or employee, the Attorney General shall prepare a report that he or she shall submit to the House Committee on Judiciary and Senate Committee on Judiciary, in which he or she shall recite the reasons for the conflict of interest and the reasons his or her office declined representation.

        Preambles. Acts 1987, No. 1064, contained a preamble which read:
       </p>
<p>
        “WHEREAS, Act 165 of 1969 (Ark. Stat. 12-2901 — 12-2903) provided statutory tort immunity to units of local government after more than 150 years of tort immunity for local government under the common law; and
       </p>
<p>
        “WHEREAS, this statute has been upheld at least 17 times by the State Supreme Court and Federal Court decisions in the past 18 years; and
       </p>
<p>
        “WHEREAS, two of these decisions, Matthews v. Martin, 280 Ark. 345, 658 S W 2d 374 (1983) and Autry v. Lawrence, 286 Ark. 501, 696 S W 2nd 315, have reaffirmed that local government employees in the performance of their official duties have the same immunity as their local government employer; and
       </p>
<p>
        “WHEREAS, Section 3 of Act 165 of 1969 (Ark. Stat. 12-2903) requires political subdivisions to carry liability insurance on their motor vehicles in the minimum amounts prescribed in the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act. These limits are now $25,000 for injury or death for one person; $50,000 for injuries or death for two or more persons and $15,000 property damage; and
       </p>
<p>
        “WHEREAS, under the Supreme Court opinion of Sturdivant v. City of Farmington, 255 Ark. 415, 500 S W 2nd 769, (1973) local governments can be self-insured up to these limits and under other Arkansas laws can form pools and groups to better self-insure the risks; and
       </p>
<p>
        “WHEREAS, the maximum combined limits for the local government employee in the performance of his official duty and the local government employer should be the minimum as provided in the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act,
       </p>
<p>
        “NOW THEREFORE….”
       </p>
<p>
        Effective Dates. Acts 1969, No. 165, § 4: became law without Governor's signature, Mar. 5, 1969. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that because of the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court in Parish v. Pitts, 244 Ark. 1239, municipalities and all units of local government are in imminent danger of bankruptcy because of tort lawsuits and vital public services are in danger of being discontinued. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary to protect the public peace, health and safety, shall take effect immediately on its passage and approval.”
       </p>
<p>
        Acts 1987, No. 590, § 6: Apr. 4, 1987. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the escalating costs of automobile liability insurance premiums for the political subdivisions and municipalities of the State of Arkansas drains the financial resources of these local governments and that financial problems of local governments threaten the delivery of vital services to the citizens of this State and that by self-insuring their motor vehicles, local governments may relieve themselves of this financial burden. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
       </p>
<p>
        Acts 1987, No. 820, § 3: Apr. 8, 1987. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that a question has arisen regarding the applicability of Act 711 of 1983 regarding cases in which first class cities, second class cities, incorporated towns, counties and their employees are covered by contracts of insurance. It was the intent of the General Assembly in enacting Act 711 of 1983 that providers of insurance coverage for said entities not be relieved of their obligations to said entities with regard to the provision of legal defense and the payment of judgments for said entities. It is further hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that cases are or may be pending in which this issue is in question, and that the immediate passage of this Act is necessary in order to clarify for the courts the legislative intent with regard to this issue. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
       </p>
<p>
        Acts 1987, No. 1064, § 3: Apr. 17, 1987. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that present law affirms governmental immunity of political subdivisions of the State but requires such political subdivisions to maintain motor vehicle liability insurance in the minimum amounts prescribed in the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law; that the Arkansas Supreme Court has held that local government employees in the performance of their duties have the same immunity as their local government employer; that this Act is designed to clarify the combined liability of local governmental entities and their employees and should be given effect immediately. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
       </p>
<p>
        Acts 1989 (3rd Ex. Sess.), No. 47, § 4: Nov. 16, 1989. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that some political subdivisions of this State have purchased motor vehicle liability insurance in excess of the minimum amounts required by the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act; that the insurers are refusing to honor the policy limits and instead claiming their maximum liability is the minimum amounts prescribed by the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act; that it is fundamentally unfair for insurance carries to not provide the coverage for which they have collected a premium; that this will require the insurance carriers to honor their contractual obligations; and that this Act should be given effect immediately in order to eliminate the inequity as soon as possible. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
       </p>
<p>
        Acts 1991, No. 542, § 11: Mar. 14, 1991. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Eighth General Assembly that a recent court decision has led to uncertainty in the area of immunity under existing Arkansas Code provisions; that to clarify such provisions will allow those persons to avoid needless legal expenses resulting from the possible misinterpretation of the law. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
       </p>
<p>
        Acts 1993, No. 292, § 7: Mar. 1, 1993. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the Seventy-Ninth General Assembly that a recent court decision regarding Act 542 of 1991 has led to uncertainty and confusion in the area of immunity of officials and employees of the state and local government of Arkansas; that this act is necessary to clarify the application and immunities of Act 542 of 1991 and to avoid the unintended interpretation of Act 542 as permitting suits directly against the liability insurers for state and local government officials and employees; and that it is necessary to extend its coverage retroactively to the effective date of Act 542 of 1991. Therefore, in order to prevent the misinterpretation of law, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
       </p>
<p>
        Acts 2011, No. 993, § 18: Apr. 1, 2011. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that it is the state's constitutional obligation to provide a general, suitable, and efficient free system of public schools in the state; that the public school funding distribution changes in this act are needed to ensure that proper funding is provided to the affected public charter schools; and that this act is immediately necessary so that the affected public charter schools will receive the amount of funding provided under this act for the current school year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

        “This act shall have a retroactive application to the effective date of Act 542 of 1991 to avoid the misinterpretation of the intent of Act 542 as permitting suits directly against liability insurers of state and local government officials and employees.

        Sovereign immunity to tort suit did not violate Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 13, in action where administratrix had other recourse for victim's suffocation in unattended jail. Hardin v. City of DeValls Bluff, 256 Ark. 480, 508 S.W.2d 559 (1974).
       </p>
<p>
        This section is not unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. Amend. 14 because the effect of this section is to restore the tort immunity of cities that had been abolished and to reaffirm the tort immunity of school districts, special improvement districts, and all other political subdivisions. Lacey v. Bekaert Steel Wire Corp., 619 F. Supp. 1234 (W.D. Ark. 1985), aff'd, 799 F.2d 434 (8th Cir. 1986).
       </p>
<p>
        The statutory scheme which provides that local governments are immune from tort liability is a valid legislative effort to provide a method and manner of relief to some victims of governmental tortfeasors; thus, the district court did not err in sustaining these sections as rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Lacey v. Bekaert Steel Wire Corp., 799 F.2d 434 (8th Cir. 1986).
       </p>
<p>
        Constitutionality of this section upheld. Plaintiffs are not denied recourse for their damage, only the right to proceed in tort. Chestnut v. Norwood, 292 Ark. 498, 731 S.W.2d 200 (1987).
       </p>
<p>
        This section is constitutional and does not violate Ark. Const., Art. 2, § 13 or Ark. Const., Art. 5, § 32. White v. City of Newport, 326 Ark. 667, 933 S.W.2d 800 (1996).
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
     In an action filed against a school district and a bus driver after the rape of a student, the provision of limited immunity under this section did not violate Ark. Const. art. 2, § 13, and an appellate court was unable to overturn caselaw to the extent that it shielded a school district from accountability under the Arkansas Public Education Act, §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.06.html#t06c15s6-15-1001" target="_blank">6-15-1001</a></cite> to 1007, because judicial precedent from the Arkansas Supreme Court had to be followed.Young v. Blytheville Sch. Dist., 2013 Ark. App. 50, 425 S.W.3d 865 (2013).
       </p>
<p>
        The former distinction between governmental and proprietary actions was abolished by this section. Augustine v. City of W. Memphis, 281 Ark. 162, 662 S.W.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
<p>
        Since statutes granting political subdivisions immunity or denying them immunity are legal; statutes which limit that liability are legal for the same reasons — to make these government entities bear some responsibility for wrongs to individuals harmed by their negligence, but also to prevent these same entities from exposure to high judgments which would destroy them. Thompson v. Sanford, 281 Ark. 365, 663 S.W.2d 932 (1984).
       </p>
<p>
        This section prevents a person from recovering for the negligence of a political subdivision, or for its employees' negligent performance of their official duties. Davis v. Fulton County, 884 F. Supp. 1245 (E.D. Ark. 1995).
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
     The grant of immunity contained in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c09s21-9-301" target="_self">21-9-301</a></cite> is not as comprehensive as the constitutional prohibition established by Article 5, Section 20, of the Arkansas Constitution; specifically, the immunity granted by statute for tortious conduct is limited to any recovery in excess of insurance coverage, whereas the constitutional prohibition against bringing an action against the state is far-reaching and applies to all circumstances where the state's treasury could be tapped for the payment of damages. Dermott Special Sch. Dist. v. Johnson, 343 Ark. 90, 32 S.W.3d 477 (2000).
       </p>
<p>
        Qualified immunity afforded by this section had to be asserted and proven as an affirmative defense; it was incumbent upon the school district to plead and prove that it was entitled to the immunity due to a lack of insurance, and the student's complaint did not have to allege the absence of insurance in order to state a cause of action.Vent v. Johnson, 2009 Ark. 92, 303 S.W.3d 46 (2009).
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
     Arkansas Legislature did not intend to partially repeal this section when it enacted the Arkansas Public Education Act, §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.06.html#t06c15s6-15-1001" target="_blank">6-15-1001</a></cite> to 1007.Young v. Blytheville Sch. Dist., 2013 Ark. App. 50, 425 S.W.3d 865 (2013).
       </p>
<p>
        While the pleading distinction between “official capacity” liability and “individual capacity” liability remains relevant in federal actions alleging official misconduct by public officials, this distinction is of no moment when determining the scope of the immunity afforded by this section in any analogous tort actions. Davis v. Fulton County, 884 F. Supp. 1245 (E.D. Ark. 1995).
       </p>
<p>
        It was the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this section to grant immunity to municipal agents and employees for acts of negligence committed in their official capacities. Autry v. Lawrence, 286 Ark. 501, 696 S.W.2d 315 (1985).
       </p>
<p>
        Claims under the torts of outrage (also known as intentional infliction of emotional distress), battery, assault, false imprisonment, and intentional torts fall outside the purview of this section. Davis v. Fulton County, 884 F. Supp. 1245 (E.D. Ark. 1995).
       </p>
<p>

     Mayor was entitled to summary judgment on police chief's claim under the Arkansas Civil Rights Act of 1993, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.16.html#t16c123s16-123-101" target="_blank">16-123-101</a></cite> et seq., because the mayor was entitled to qualified immunity; the mayor could not have reasonably known that his termination of the police chief's employment, which was done upon the discovery of missing or incomplete police reports 15 days after the police chief made a statement at a city council meeting, would violate the police chief's constitutional right to free speech under Ark. Const. art. 2, § 6. Smith v. Brt, 363 Ark. 126, 211 S.W.3d 485 (2005).
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
     Although the former police chief alleged a violation of the right to freedom of speech under Ark. Const. art. 2, § 6, he failed to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the mayor would have known that his termination of the chief's employment as police chief violated that clearly established right; because the chief did not raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the mayor would have known that the dismissal violated the chief's clearly established constitutional right, the mayor was entitled to qualified immunity under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c09s21-9-301" target="_self">21-9-301</a></cite>.Smith v. Brt, 363 Ark. 126, 211 S.W.3d 485 (2005).

<p>
        Educational cooperative, unless covered by liability insurance for the damages alleged in a complaint against it, was immune from liability and from suit for damages under this section because it was an agency of a school district.Ark.

       </p>
<p>
        This section provides city employees with immunity from civil liability for negligent acts, but not for intentional acts.City of Fayetteville v. Romine, 373 Ark. 318, 284 S.W.3d 10 (2008).
       </p>
<p>
        Trial court erred in denying a city's motion for summary judgment in an action by property owners for damage to their property because at no point did the complaint mention breach of a contract; because the city put forth proof that it did not have insurance coverage for the claim alleged, it was entitled to immunity under subsection (a) of this section as to the tort cause of action.City of Malvern v. Jenkins, 2013 Ark. 24, 425 S.W.3d 711 (2013).
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
     A county is a unit of local government and does not share in the state's immunity from <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1983</cite> civil rights actions, thus, where the violation of policies by a sheriff over a period of time were overlooked, the county as an entity was responsible for injuries caused. Mosier v. Robinson, 722 F. Supp. 555 (W.D. Ark. 1989).
       </p>
<p>
        Trial court erred in denying a city employee's motion for summary judgment in a property owner's action for violation of civil rights where the employee established that the employee was entitled to qualified immunity; because sewer lines were not owned by the city, but were instead private lines, the city, and by extension, the employee, owed no duty to the owner.City of Fayetteville v. Romine, 373 Ark. 318, 284 S.W.3d 10 (2008).

     In a former inmate's action for damages stemming from a rape by a county jailer, a county judge was entitled to summary judgment dismissing the civil rights claims under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.16.html#t16c123s16-123-105" target="_blank">16-123-105</a></cite> on immunity grounds under this section because the inmate failed to establish that the County acted with deliberate indifference when it hired the jailer where the inmate only offered unsupported allegations that the jailer had previously inappropriately hugged and kissed a 16-year-old female inmate; an unwanted hug and kiss were not nearly identical enough to the inmate's allegations to constitute deliberate indifference.Gentry v. Robinson, 2009 Ark. 634, 361 S.W.3d 788 (2009).

        In plaintiff's lawsuit against defendants, the school district and school officials, in which he asserted that his disabled child was subjected to multiple incidents of sexual abuse in his classroom in the presence of teachers, the district court held that defendants were immune from suit for negligence under this section.Braden v. Mt. Home Sch. Dist., 903 F. Supp. 2d 729 (W.D. Ark. 2012).
       </p>
<p>
        Police officer was entitled to qualified immunity on appellee's claim for violation of the right to remonstrate; the lack of precedent made it clear that appellee's right to remonstrate was not clearly established at the time of appellee's arrest.Graham v. Cawthorn, 2013 Ark. 160, 427 S.W.3d 34 (2013).
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
     In a case alleging abuse of process and false light, a county judge was entitled to qualified immunity under this section; the factual recitations within the body of the complaint indicated that the suit was against the judge only in his official capacity, and it did not identify or plead facts sufficient to show that he violated an established statutory or constitutional right. In addition, the county judge was entitled to judicial immunity when he entered an order requiring a county clerk to retain employees who had filed a grievance because he was performing a quasi-judicial function.Blevins v. Hudson, 2016 Ark. 150, 489 S.W.3d 165 (2016), cert. denied, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">137 S. Ct. 239</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">196 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 134 (2016).

<p>
        An action against a city by a landowner who alleged that his execution of a deed granting the city an easement across his property for the installation of sewer lines was induced by deliberate fraud was a cause of action for deceit which would be precluded by this section. Harrington v. City of Greenbrier, 262 Ark. 773, 561 S.W.2d 302 (1978).
       </p>
<p>
</p><p>
     Where plaintiff's tort claim against county was denied by county judge and plaintiff sought a de novo review in the circuit court in accordance with §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.16.html#t16c67s16-67-207" target="_blank">16-67-207</a></cite>, the circuit judge held that the provisions of this section immunized the county from the tort claim and properly dismissed the claim. The circuit court thus did, in the de novo review pursuant to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.16.html#t16c67s16-67-207" target="_blank">16-67-207</a></cite>, exactly as it would have had to do if the case had been brought “as other cases at law.” Bigelow v. Union County, 287 Ark. 486, 701 S.W.2d 125 (1985).
       </p>
<p>
        State employees are not immune from suit for negligence to the extent they are covered by other viable liability insurance. Deitsch v. Tillery, 309 Ark. 401, 833 S.W.2d 760 (1992).
       </p>
<p>
        Construction company was not an insurer for the purposes of administrator's wrongful death action, notwithstanding that it agreed to indemnify the city against damages and obtained insurance to do so. Cherry v. Tanda, Inc., 327 Ark. 600, 940 S.W.2d 457 (1997).
       </p>
<p>
        Administrator's action against insurance carrier as a quasi-insurer of the city under this section was without merit where the insurance contract was carried by the employer construction company, not the city. Cherry v. Tanda, Inc., 327 Ark. 600, 940 S.W.2d 457 (1997).
       </p>
<p>
        A city is not immune to the extent that it has liability insurance. City of Caddo Valley v. George, 340 Ark. 203, 9 S.W.3d 481 (2000).
       </p>
<p>
        Summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of a city and its employee in a negligence action based on governmental immunity where there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the operation of the loader on public roads was frequent and regular or merely incidental and, thus, whether the front-end loader was exempted from the statutory definition of “motor vehicle.” Spears v. City of Fordyce, 351 Ark. 305, 92 S.W.3d 38 (2002).
       </p>
<p>
        Immunity for negligent torts afforded to school districts and employees was qualified, and an employee or district could be sued to the extent that applicable coverage existed under a policy of insurance; however, the appellate court could not determine whether there was insurance coverage because the actual policy was not included for review and, as the school district had the burden to make the insurance policy a part of the record, the denial of the school district's motion for summary judgment on parent's negligence claim was affirmed. Helena-West Helena Sch. Dist. v. Monday, 361 Ark. 82, 204 S.W.3d 514 (2005).
       </p>
<p>
        Under this section, the city and its employees enjoy immunity from liability and from suits for damages, except to the extent that the city is covered by liability insurance, or acts as a self-insured for certain amounts as provided by statute. City of Farmington v. Smith, 366 Ark. 473, 237 S.W.3d 1 (2006).
       </p>
<p>
        Even though this section provided immunity to a public school district with regard to a mother's claim, that it negligently failed to provide adequate supervision for her disabled child, which resulted in the child's being sexually assaulted by a fellow special needs student at school, the school district was denied summary judgment as to that claim because it failed to present any evidence showing that its liability insurance policy did not cover that claim: (1) the statute granted immunity to the school district, except to the extent that it was covered by liability insurance; (2) therefore, in order to establish its immunity as a matter of law, the school district had to show that the mother's negligence claim was not covered by its insurance policy; and (3) the school district did not prove that it did not have insurance coverage with regard to the mother's claim because it did not present a copy of its insurance policy to support its summary judgment motion.Finch v. Texarkana Sch. Dist. No. 7, 557 F. Supp. 2d 976 (W.D. Ark. 2008).
       </p>
<p>
        Circuit court properly denied a city and its employees summary judgment on a citizen's negligence claims because they did not show that they were entitled to assert the affirmative defense of statutory immunity; under this section, it was incumbent on the city and its employees, and not on plaintiff, to plead and prove entitlement to immunity due to a lack of insurance.City of Little Rock v. Dayong Yang, 2017 Ark. 18, 509 S.W.3d 632 (2017).
       </p>
<p>
        When a defendant pleads an affirmative defense of immunity, that defendant must plead and prove no liability coverage under this section for purposes of summary judgment.City of Little Rock v. Dayong Yang, 2017 Ark. 18, 509 S.W.3d 632 (2017).
       </p>
<p>
        Although the defendant city and its employees admitted in their intial answer the averment in the first complaint that they lacked insurance coverage, those pleadings were superseded by the third amended complaint and the answer to that complaint, which did not incorporate previous pleadings.City of Little Rock v. Dayong Yang, 2017 Ark. 18, 509 S.W.3d 632 (2017).
       </p>
<p>
        It was error for the circuit court to deny Metropolitan Emergency Medical Services (MEMS) summary judgment for statutory immunity beyond its insurance coverage because plaintiff placed in the record two insurance policies as evidence of MEMS's insurance coverage, and the policies established facts that MEMS did not dispute, thus leaving only a matter of statutory interpretation.City of Little Rock v. Dayong Yang, 2017 Ark. 18, 509 S.W.3d 632 (2017).
       </p>
<p>
        Circuit court properly denied a police officer and dog handler's motion for summary judgment in his injured neighbor's action for negligence and strict liability for housing an animal known to have dangerous tendencies, where the officer maintained the police dog at his residence and remained on call 24 hours a day as part of his duties; the officer was not entitled to summary judgment because he failed to plead and prove that the city lacked liability coverage.Harris v. Beth, 2017 Ark. App. 186, 518 S.W.3d 126 (2017).
       </p>
<p>
        While public officials named under this section are immune from tort liability for negligent acts committed in the performance of their official duties, that immunity does not include intentional torts committed by those officials. Battle v. Harris, 298 Ark. 241, 766 S.W.2d 431 (1989).
       </p>
<p>
        The immunity granted in this section does not apply to intentional torts. Almand v. Benton County, 145 B.R. 608 (Bankr. W.D. Ark. 1992).
       </p>
<p>
        The tort of outrage is an intentional tort for which a cause of action lies where the conduct is so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society; this section does not provide immunity for the intentional acts of school districts. Deitsch v. Tillery, 309 Ark. 401, 833 S.W.2d 760 (1992).
       </p>
<p>
        Intentional actions by board members are not protected by statutory immunity. West Memphis Sch. Dist. No. 4 v. Circuit Court, 316 Ark. 290, 871 S.W.2d 368 (1994).
       </p>
<p>
        This section does not shield intentional torts such as battery. Morris v. Crawford County, 173 F. Supp. 2d 870 (W.D. Ark. 2001), aff'd, 299 F.3d 919 (8th Cir. 2002).
       </p>
<p>
        Although this section did not apply to give a public school district immunity as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim (IIED) asserted by a disabled child's mother, arising from the fact that the child was sexually assaulted by a fellow special needs student at school, because IIED was an intentional tort of outrage and this section did not provide immunity as to intentional torts, the district court was nevertheless granted summary judgment as to the mother's IIED claim because she did not show that a material factual dispute existed as to whether its conduct was so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be utterly intolerable in a civilized society.Finch v. Texarkana Sch. Dist. No. 7, 557 F. Supp. 2d 976 (W.D. Ark. 2008).
       </p>
<p>
        Trial court erred in failing to dismiss a property owner's claim against a city for reimbursement for construction of a retaining wall on his property in order to maintain a ditch on an adjacent city right-of-way because recovery on a negligence or trespass claim would be statutorily barred.City of Alexander v. Doss, 102 Ark. App. 232, 284 S.W.3d 74 (2008).
       </p>
<p>
        Battery claim against a police officer survived a motion for summary judgment because this section provided city employees with immunity from civil liability for negligent acts but not for intentional acts.Martin v. Hallum, 2010 Ark. App. 193, 374 S.W.3d 152 (2010).
       </p>
<p>
        In an action against a school district and a bus driver arising from a student's rape, although the student was a victim of intentional torts when she was pulled into a bathroom and raped, there was no facts indicating that the school district or the bus driver committed those acts or any other intentional torts. Therefore, immunity was provided under this section.Young v. Blytheville Sch. Dist., 2013 Ark. App. 50, 425 S.W.3d 865 (2013).
       </p>
<p>
        It is a deliberate, knowing trespass that bars application of the doctrine of qualified immunity; appellant's proof failed to show that appellees trespassed on her property deliberately and with knowledge that they were doing so, and summary judgment for appellees was proper.Williams v. Pate, 2015 Ark. App. 327, 463 S.W.3d 734 (2015).
       </p>
<p>
        Circuit court erred by denying summary judgment to a police officer based on immunity, where the officer did not commit the intentional torts of false arrest or false imprisonment; the officer had arrested appellee based on an outstanding warrant that had in fact been issued against a different person.Trammell v. Wright, 2016 Ark. 147, 489 S.W.3d 636 (2016).
       </p>
<p>
        Where a landowner's action could be taken as a suit for damages for trespass, the chancery court had no jurisdiction since equity will not take jurisdiction of an action to recover unliquidated damages for tort and since the county is immune from suit for damages in a tort action. Chamberlain v. Newton County, 266 Ark. 516, 587 S.W.2d 4 (1979).
       </p>
<p>
        This section establishes an immunity defense; that does not mean that the circuit court is without jurisdiction to hear a motion to dismiss on statutory immunity grounds. West Memphis Sch. Dist. No. 4 v. Circuit Court, 316 Ark. 290, 871 S.W.2d 368 (1994).
       </p>
<p>
        A city police officer acting in his official capacity when he presented evidence to the prosecutor which resulted in plaintiff's arrest was immune from an action for malicious prosecution. Autry v. Lawrence, 286 Ark. 501, 696 S.W.2d 315 (1985).
       </p>
<p>
        City collector was entitled to qualified immunity in a malicious prosecution action by a receiver who was prosecuted for payment of taxes owed by a corporation with a worthless check. Culpepper v. Biggers, 742 F. Supp. 528 (E.D. Ark. 1990).
       </p>
<p>
        A suit against county for damages for death which resulted when vehicle left county public road on an allegedly unmarked curve was barred on the basis of the county's immunity from tort liability. Sullivan v. Pulaski County, 247 Ark. 259, 445 S.W.2d 94 (1969).
       </p>
<p>
        A suit against county for negligence which resulted in injuries to appellant from an automobile accident allegedly caused by the county's negligence in failing to erect certain warning signs and speed limit signs was barred on the basis of the county's immunity from tort liability. Chandler v. Pulaski County, 247 Ark. 262, 445 S.W.2d 96 (1969).
       </p>
<p>
        Municipal officers and employees are immune from tort liability for negligent acts they may commit in the performance of their official duties; accordingly, a city fire chief, a city director of planning, and a city manager were immune from an action brought against them in their official capacities alleging that, due to the officers' negligence, the plaintiffs' residence burned because of the city fire department's refusal to respond to a call for assistance. Matthews v. Martin, 280 Ark. 345, 658 S.W.2d 374 (1983).
       </p>
<p>
        City and its public utility commission were immune from suit to recover for personal injuries suffered by plaintiff when she was struck by a falling limb that had been cut by an employee of the city or of the commission while engaged in cutting tree limbs along a public street. Augustine v. City of W. Memphis, 281 Ark. 162, 662 S.W.2d 813 (1984).
       </p>
<p>
        Where school district built house as vocational education project, action for fire loss was one in tort for negligence and was barred by this section. Bankston v. Pulaski County School Dist., 281 Ark. 476, 665 S.W.2d 859 (1984).
       </p>
<p>
        Where employees were performing their official duties for the school district that employed them at the time of their alleged acts of negligence, they and the school district are immune from tort liability under this section. Cousins v. Dennis, 298 Ark. 310, 767 S.W.2d 296 (1989).
       </p>

     In order that persons injured by a political subdivisions' vehicles may have redress for negligence, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c09s21-9-303" target="_self">21-9-303</a></cite> requires political subdivisions to carry liability insurance on their motor vehicles. King v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 301 Ark. 148, 782 S.W.2d 574 (1990).
       </p>
<p>
        A school choir director was immune from a cause of action for negligence, and a school district was immune from a cause of action for negligence in hiring and supervising, instructing, and training personnel. Wallace ex rel. Wallace v. Bryant Sch. Dist., 46 F. Supp. 2d 863 (E.D. Ark. 1999), aff'd without op., 208 F.3d 219 (8th Cir. 2000).
       </p>
<p>
        Judge sued for damages following an automobile accident was not entitled to immunity where the evidence did not establish that he was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident; in addition, because the judge failed to make a motion for a directed verdict on the issue of immunity, the issue was waived for appellate review. Carlew v. Wright, 356 Ark. 208, 148 S.W.3d 237 (2004).
       </p>
<p>
        According to this section, city employees have immunity from civil liabiltiy for negligent acts, but not for intentional acts. City of Farmington v. Smith, 366 Ark. 473, 237 S.W.3d 1 (2006).
       </p>
<p>
        In a case arising from the removal of gravel from the owners'property, a negligence claim against the county failed because it was precluded and foreclosed by this section.Finch v. Carroll County, 2014 Ark. App. 564, 445 S.W.3d 535 (2014).
       </p>
<p>
        Two affidavits sufficiently established that the city did not possess general-liability insurance at the time of the accident to cover plaintiff's negligence claims; moreover, plaintiff did not meet proof with proof to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on this issue, and thus the city was entitled to municipal immunity.Yang v. City of Little Rock, 2019 Ark. 169, 575 S.W.3d 394 (2019).
       </p>
<p>
        Corporation which expressly stated in its articles of incorporation that its purpose was to aid educational institutions inside the city, but whose activities far exceeded its declared purpose, operated outside of the statutory boundaries of a utility commission as permitted by the code and thus, corporation was not entitled to immunity as a political subdivision under this section. Masterson v. Stambuck, 321 Ark. 391, 902 S.W.2d 803 (1995).
       </p>
<p>
        Counties are expressly included within the class of “political subdivisions” protected by this section. Davis v. Fulton County, 884 F. Supp. 1245 (E.D. Ark. 1995).
       </p>
<p>
        The Quorum Court is a “political subdivision” which benefits from any immunity afforded by this section. Davis v. Fulton County, 884 F. Supp. 1245 (E.D. Ark. 1995).

<p>
          In order that persons injured by a political subdivisions' vehicles may have redress for negligence, this section requires political subdivisions to carry liability insurance on their motor vehicles. King v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 301 Ark. 148, 782 S.W.2d 574 (1990).
         </p>
<p>
          The legislature did not intend for a school district to insure a bus that was owned by an independent entity, operated by a driver who was not employed or hired by the district, and chartered for a one day field trip. King v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 301 Ark. 148, 782 S.W.2d 574 (1990).
         </p>
<p>
</p><p>
       Regardless of statutory governmental tort immunity, city which failed to conform to this section was responsible as self-insurer for injuries resulting from negligent operation of its vehicles up to amount equivalent to required policy limits stated in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.27.html#t27c19s27-19-713" target="_blank">27-19-713</a></cite>. Sturdivant v. Farmington, 255 Ark. 415, 500 S.W.2d 769 (1973).
         </p>
<p>
          The holding in Sturdivant v. City of Farmington, 255 Ark. 415, 500 S.W.2d 769 (1973), which made school districts self-insurers when they did not carry insurance, is not unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine of Ark. Const., Art. 4, § 2. Thompson v. Sanford, 281 Ark. 365, 663 S.W.2d 932 (1984).
         </p>
<p>
          In personal injury action against school district and its employee, employee was not entitled to instruction on district's limited liability, and the trial court was right to wait until the jury had determined liability and damages before applying this section as interpreted by Sturdivant v. City of Farmington, 255 Ark. 415, 500 S.W.2d 769 (1973). Thompson v. Sanford, 281 Ark. 365, 663 S.W.2d 932 (1984).
         </p>
<p>
          A city is not immune to the extent that it has liability insurance. City of Caddo Valley v. George, 340 Ark. 203, 9 S.W.3d 481 (2000).
         </p>
<p>
          Because there were two emergency vehicles involved in the accident and each officer was found five percent at fault, the city, as a joint tortfeasor, would be jointly and severally liable in the amount of $25,000.00 for each of the city's vehicles; therefore, defendant should have recovered $50,000.00 against the city, and the trial court erred in ruling otherwise. City of Caddo Valley v. George, 340 Ark. 203, 9 S.W.3d 481 (2000).
         </p>
<p>
          Trial court did not err in reducing a jury's award of $92,500 for bodily injury to a motorcyclist against a city in a negligence action involving a city-owned garbage truck to $25,000, the maximum amount of its liability under the state's tort immunity law and subsection (b) of this section. Fritzinger v. Beene, 80 Ark. App. 416, 97 S.W.3d 440 (2003).
         </p>
<p>
          This section requires all municipalities to carry liability insurance on their vehicles or be treated as self-insurers, but the statute does not require a municipality to guarantee the solvency of its insurer; thus, where coverage was in effect when the accident occurred and there was no evidence that the city could have anticipated that its carrier would become insolvent, once the city's insurer did become insolvent, the city should not have been relegated to the status of a self-insurer. Taylor v. City of N. Little Rock, 88 Ark. App. 48, 194 S.W.3d 797 (2004).
         </p>
<p>
          The General Assembly, in requiring political subdivisions to purchase motor vehicle liability insurance, never intended nonregistered vehicles to be covered. Cousins v. Dennis, 298 Ark. 310, 767 S.W.2d 296 (1989).
         </p>
<p>
          Self-propelling mowers and other equipment not designed or intended for transportation purposes — being exempt from registration — are not required to comply with the security deposit or liability insurance provisions required under the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act. Cousins v. Dennis, 298 Ark. 310, 767 S.W.2d 296 (1989).
         </p>
<p>
          This section does not require political subdivisions to purchase motor vehicle liability insurance for non-registered vehicles. Clark v. Randolph County, 71 Ark. App. 112, 36 S.W.3d 353 (2000).
         </p>
<p>
          Summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of a city and its employee in a negligence action based on governmental immunity where there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the operation of the loader on public roads was frequent and regular or merely incidental and, thus, whether the front-end loader was exempted from the statutory definition of “motor vehicle.” Spears v. City of Fordyce, 351 Ark. 305, 92 S.W.3d 38 (2002).
         </p>
<p>
          If a political subdivision fails to carry liability insurance on its motor vehicles it becomes, in effect, a self-insurer and may be held liable for an amount not to exceed the minimum amounts of coverage prescribed by the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act. King v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 301 Ark. 148, 782 S.W.2d 574 (1990).
         </p>
<p>
          In a negligence action stemming from a motor vehicle accident, the trial court erred in declaring the city to be self-insurer because, at the time of the accident, the city had in full force and effect a motor vehicle liability insurance policy and there was no evidence that the city could have anticipated that its carrier would become insolvent. Taylor v. City of N. Little Rock, 88 Ark. App. 48, 194 S.W.3d 797 (2004).
         </p>
<p>
          Where teachers were acting within the scope of their employment at time of school bus accident, injured teachers' exclusive remedy was to file claims under the Workers' Compensation Act and they were not entitled to any part of the school district's insurance policy proceeds. Helms v. Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co., 281 Ark. 450, 664 S.W.2d 870 (1984).

          Effective Dates. Acts 1983, No. 564, § 2: Mar. 21, 1983. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined that the provisions of recently enacted federal legislation, including the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, have created a serious uncertainty as to the manner in which public securities, including bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness or other obligations for the payment of money, issued by the State of Arkansas or by any of its departments, agencies, or other instrumentalities or by any of its political subdivisions, should be executed and that such uncertainty threatens to delay projects being financed by such securities and to make such financings more expensive, thereby jeopardizing the ability of residents of the State of Arkansas to realize the benefits to be obtained from such projects, and it is further found that the immediate passage of this Act is necessary to resolve such uncertainties and to assist citizens of the State of Arkansas in obtaining the benefits from such projects. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Act, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety of the citizens of the State of Arkansas, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

   Effective Dates. Acts 1995, No. 200, § 5: Feb. 9, 1995. Emergency clause provided: “Many commercial documents are required to include a notary certificate to comply with terms imposed by purchase orders, business contracts, construction standards, testing standards and other commercial practices. Where such documents are produced by computer and subscribed by an affiant in facsimile form, substantial time and expense is required for a notary public to manually sign, seal and affix notary certificates as required by present law, which increases operating costs, makes Arkansas business less competitive and costs Arkansas jobs. Arkansas law presently permits authorized officers to sign and seal public securities and instruments of payment by facsimile signature and seal under similar circumstances, following a filing with the secretary of state (Ark. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t21c10s21-10-101" target="_self">21-10-101</a></cite> et seq.), but has no similar provision for notaries public on commercial documents. Operating costs may be reduced and expensive business equipment may be more fully utilized by allowing notaries public to affix notary certificates bearing facsimile signatures and seals under appropriate circumstances. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
<p>
      Acts 2001, No. 1274, § 8: Apr. 4, 2001. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly that the notary public law needs to be updated and reformed immediately. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

It is further found and determined that, in some instances, allegations of employee criminal misconduct involving children are not being investigated. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on October 1, 1997.”

<p>
      (1)(A)When a person applies for employment with a state agency in a designated financial or information technology position and if the state agency intends to make an offer of employment to the applicant, the applicant shall complete a criminal history check form and shall submit the form to the state agency as part of the application process.
     </p>
<p>
      Within five (5) days of the state agency's decision to make an offer of employment to the applicant, the state agency shall use the Online Criminal Background Check System to obtain the criminal history or forward the criminal history check form to the Identification Bureau of the Department of Arkansas State Police and request the bureau to review the database of criminal history.
     </p>
<p>
      Within three (3) days of the receipt of a request to review the database, the bureau shall notify the state agency if the database contains any criminal history record on the applicant.
     </p>
<p>
      If no criminal history record regarding the applicant is found in the database, then the state agency may make an offer of temporary employment to the applicant while the bureau completes a criminal history check and the state agency determines whether the applicant is disqualified from employment under subsection (f) of this section.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)If a criminal history record regarding the applicant is found in the database, then the applicant is temporarily disqualified from employment until the state agency determines whether the applicant is disqualified from employment under subsection (f) of this section.
     </p>
<p>
      If the state agency determines that the applicant is not disqualified, then the state agency may continue to temporarily employ the applicant while the bureau completes a criminal history check.
     </p>
<p>
      (1)Except as provided in subdivision (b)(2) of this section, the bureau shall conduct a state criminal history check and a national criminal history check on an applicant upon receiving a criminal history check request from a state agency.
     </p>
<p>
      (A)If the state agency can verify that the applicant has been employed by a state agency in a designated financial or information technology position within sixty (60) days before the application or has lived continuously in the State of Arkansas for the past five (5) years, the bureau shall conduct only a state criminal history check on the applicant.
     </p>
<p>
      If the state agency can verify that the selected applicant currently works for a state agency in a designated position or a designated financial or information technology position and the state agency can provide verification that a criminal history check for that position has been completed in the last five (5) years, the state agency does not need to conduct another criminal history check on the employee until the criminal history check is five (5) years old.
