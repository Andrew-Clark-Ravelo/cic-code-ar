Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the people of the State of Arkansas overwhelmingly approved the establishment of lotteries at the 2008 General Election; that the Eighty-seventh General Assembly adopted Acts 605 and 606 of 2009 that implemented lotteries and made corresponding revisions to the Arkansas Academic Challenge Scholarship Program; that this bill amends provisions of Acts 605 and 606 of 2009 pertaining to lotteries and the Arkansas Academic Challenge Scholarship Program; and that the failure to immediately implement this act will cause a reduction in lottery proceeds that will harm the educational and economic success of potential students eligible to receive scholarships under the act. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

     <ol>
      <li id="t25c01s25-1-501ol11">
       Boycotts and related tactics have become tools of economic warfare that threaten the sovereignty and security of key allies and trade partners of the United States;
      </li>
      <li id="t25c01s25-1-501ol12">
       The State of Israel is the most prominent target of such boycott activity, which began with but has not been limited to the Arab League boycott adopted in 1945, even before Israel's declaration of independence as the reestablished national state of the Jewish people;
      </li>
      <li id="t25c01s25-1-501ol13">
       Companies that refuse to deal with United States trade partners such as Israel, or entities that do business with or in such countries, make discriminatory decisions on the basis of national origin that impair those companies' commercial soundness;
      </li>
      <li id="t25c01s25-1-501ol14">
       It is the public policy of the United States, as enshrined in several federal acts, to oppose boycotts against Israel, and the United States Congress has concluded as a matter of national trade policy that cooperation with Israel materially benefits United States companies and improves American competitiveness;
      </li>
      <li id="t25c01s25-1-501ol15">
       Israel in particular is known for its dynamic and innovative approach in many business sectors, and therefore a company's decision to discriminate against Israel, Israeli entities, or entities that do business with or in Israel, is an unsound business practice, making the company an unduly risky contracting partner or vehicle for investment; and
      </li>
      <li id="t25c01s25-1-501ol16">
       Arkansas seeks to act to implement the United States Congress's announced policy of “examining a company's promotion or compliance with unsanctioned boycotts, divestment from, or sanctions against Israel as part of its consideration in awarding grants and contracts and supports the divestment of state assets from companies that support or promote actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel”.

        Publisher's Notes. Acts 1971, No. 38, which is primarily codified in chapters 2-14 of this title, reorganized the structure of state government by creating or continuing certain principal administrative departments into which various agencies and programs were transferred. However, many principal departments, referred to by Acts 1971, No. 38, are originally created, or their duties defined, by statutes which are integrally related to, and codified in, other titles of the Arkansas Code. It should also be noted that Acts 1971, No. 38, as amended, is not completely comprehensive and does not refer to a number of departments which are created elsewhere in the Arkansas Code. Please consult the notes throughout chapters 2-14 for references to relevant provisions in other titles.

          Publisher's Notes. Acts 1971, No. 38, § 1, provided, in part, that employees who were members of any retirement system at the time of the 1971 governmental reorganization would not lose any accrued retirement benefits as a result of the transfer of any department, commission, or agency. The employees were allowed six (6) months from the date of the transfer to elect whether to continue in the same retirement system or join the system for which the transfer made them eligible.

            A.C.R.C. Notes. Acts 2015, No. 970, § 25, provided: “ESTABLISHMENT OF A ‘POSITION POOL’.
           </p>
           <p>
            “(a)To address needs emerging from statewide education issues and the necessity of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, the Arkansas Department of Education or its successor agency is authorized for the 2015-2016 fiscal year a pool of no more than five (5) Professional/Executive positions at a salary not to exceed the maximum salary for a grade N912. These positions are to be used by the Department of Education in the event that the personal services needs of the Department during the 2015-2016 fiscal year require additional positions, either by title or in number, that are not authorized by the General Assembly in Section 1 of this Act. These positions may also be used to properly classify positions when the Department does not have a vacant position available with the appropriate title and salary level.
           </p>
           <p>
            “(b)To address needs emerging from statewide education issues and the necessity of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, the Arkansas Department of Education or its successor agency is authorized for the 2015-2016 fiscal year a pool of ten (10) classified positions at up to a grade C130. These positions are to be used by the Department of Education in the event that the personal services needs of the Department during the 2015-2016 fiscal year require additional positions, either by classification or in number, that are not authorized by the General Assembly in Section 1 of this Act. These positions may also be used to properly classify positions when the Department does not have a vacant position available with the appropriate title and grade level.
           </p>
           <p>
            “(c)Any salary determinations or adjustments administered under the provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section shall be made by comparing the qualifications and salary levels of similar employees in school districts or in other state education agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            “(d)The Department of Education is authorized to access the pool positions authorized in this Section at any time when it is determined by the Commissioner that the need exists. The Commissioner shall provide a monthly report of the justification for the need to allocate titles from this growth pool to the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and to the Arkansas Legislative Council for review. The report shall also include an accounting of the names, titles, and salaries of personnel whose salaries have been adjusted under provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section.
           </p>
           <p>
            “(e)If the Department of Education requests continuation of any ‘Position Pool’ position(s) as established herein during the next fiscal year, the position(s) must be requested as a new position(s) in the agency's budget request.
           </p>
           <p>
            “(f)Determining the number of personnel to be employed by a state agency is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by delineating the maximum number of personnel by identifying job titles and the maximum grade or salary attached to those titles. The General Assembly has determined that the Arkansas Department of Education could be operated more efficiently if some flexibility is given to that agency. That flexibility is being accomplished by providing a position pool in Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section and since the General Assembly has granted the agency broad powers under the growth pool concept, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the position pool by requiring review of the Legislative Council in the utilization of the position pool. Therefore, the requirement of review by the Legislative Council is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of review by the Legislative Council is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.

          Acts 2014, No. 282, § 17, provided:
         </p>
         <p>
          “TRANSFER AUTHORITY. The Director of the Department of Human Services shall have transfer authority provided by the following:
         </p>
         <p>
          “(a)DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES RENOVATION FUND. The Director of the Department of Human Services is authorized to request fund transfers according to the provisions established by Arkansas Code Ann. 19-5-1020, Department of Human Services Renovation Fund, as amended herein; and
         </p>
         <p>
          “(b)MATCH TRANSFER. The Director of the Department of Human Services, with the approval of the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, is authorized to effect inter-agency and inter-divisional fund transfers for the purpose of providing the State's matching share for payments made to that Division or Office or its service providers for services eligible for federal reimbursement under programs administered by the Department of Human Services. The Department of Human Services shall report to the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee on a quarterly basis all fund transfers made in accordance with the authority granted by this section; and
         </p>
         <p>
          “(c)YOUTH SERVICES — HOUSING AND SEPARATION APPROPRIATION PROVISIONS. The Division of Youth Services (DYS) is authorized to fulfill its responsibility to house offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 and to separate juvenile offenders by age and seriousness of offense by either employing additional state employees and providing the corresponding operating expenses or entering into professional services contracts. If the Division of Youth Services determines that the Division needs to employ state employees to fulfill the housing and separation requirements, they may transfer up to the total amount appropriated for the DYS — Residential Services Program appropriation to the appropriate DYS appropriation and line items, upon approval of the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, and prior review by the Legislative Council; and
         </p>
         <p>
          “(d)REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES:
         </p>
         <p>
          “(1)The Department of Human Services (DHS) provides hundreds of different services to over 1 million Arkansans. The specific mix of service needs and the funding and staffing required to provide them can vary significantly based on many factors, including natural disasters, changing federal mandates and funding sources, demographic shifts, fluctuating court-ordered services, social trends, and job market variations such as nursing shortages. The impact of these factors through the course of any fiscal year make it very difficult for the Department to accurately predict the exact needs for funding, appropriation and positions in each of its over 100 different appropriations. To ensure that it can respond quickly to changing client needs and make the most effective use of the resources allocated to it, the Department of Human Services shall be authorized to utilize the reallocation of resource authority to make the proper adjustments to the budgets within the Department. Therefore, upon determination by the Director of the Department of Human Services that a reallocation of resources within the department is necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the department, the director, with approval of the Governor, shall have the authority to request, from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, a transfer of positions, appropriations, line item appropriations, and funds within or between existing and newly created divisions, offices, sections, or units of the department. Provided, however, that no transfer of funds or appropriation that provides direct support or matching support for the Arkansas Medicaid Program shall be made to any other fund account or appropriation that does not directly support the Arkansas Medicaid Program. Further, no positions, funds, or appropriation authorized during the budget process for the Division of Children and Family Services compliance with initiatives established under the Angela R. consent decree shall be transferred to any other division. Nothing in this provision is intended to prevent the one-time transfers of savings in any other program to the Arkansas Medicaid Program, with the exception of the provisions previously cited for the Division of Children and Family Services — Angela R. consent decree. The Division of Developmental Disabilities — Grants to Community Providers line item of the Developmental Disabilities Services — Grants-in-Aid appropriation may not be decreased. The appropriation, funding, and positions provided for the five Human Development Centers shall remain at a level sufficient to ensure quality care for the Centers' residents. The exemptions provided in this subsection whereby certain DHS Programs and Divisions are protected from appropriation, fund, or position transfers are applicable only to the reallocation or transfer authority granted herein, and not by any reductions which are applicable to all state programs.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The Director of the Department of Human Services shall submit any requests for transfers to and must receive approval of the requests for transfers from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, the Governor, and the Arkansas Legislative Council prior to the effective date of the transfers. Provided, however, that the Department of Human Services shall be limited to submitting no more than two reallocation of resources transfer requests during any fiscal year. In each Departmental request no single division will request reallocation for more than one purpose as listed in this section. Transfer authority for unforeseen purposes shall further be limited to no more than 5% of the total appropriation, funding, and positions authorized for the Department. Reallocation of resources transfers may include multiple items but shall be limited to the following purposes:
         </p>
         <p>
          “i). Medicaid Program
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>

          “iii). Departmental grants and contracts
         </p>

          “iv). Court ordered settlements and payments
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          “vi). Restructuring efforts as deemed necessary to comply with new and/or unanticipated federal or state mandates
         </p>
         <p>
          “vii). Redirecting internal resources, both direct and/or indirect, to meet client needs and services
         </p>
         <p>
          “Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the Department of Human Services may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the Department of Human Services authorizing broad powers under the Reallocation of Resources provisions herein. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(2)If it is determined that the requested reallocation of resources transfers should be made, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall then initiate the necessary transfer documents to reflect the transfers upon the fiscal records of the Treasurer of State, the Auditor of State, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, and the Department of Human Services. In addition, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, together with the Co-Chairpersons of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, may approve, on an emergency basis, requests for utilization of this Section without prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative Council, with any such actions reported at the next meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council.

          “TRANSFER AUTHORITY. The Director of the Department of Human Services shall have transfer authority provided by the following:
         </p>
         <p>
          “(a)DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES RENOVATION FUND. The Director of the Department of Human Services is authorized to request fund transfers according to the provisions established by Arkansas Code Ann. 19-5-1020, Department of Human Services Renovation Fund, as amended herein; and
         </p>
         <p>
          “(b)MATCH TRANSFER. The Director of the Department of Human Services, with the approval of the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, is authorized to effect inter-agency and inter-divisional fund transfers for the purpose of providing the State's matching share for payments made to that Division or Office or its service providers for services eligible for federal reimbursement under programs administered by the Department of Human Services. The Department of Human Services shall report to the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee on a quarterly basis all fund transfers made in accordance with the authority granted by this section; and
         </p>
         <p>
          “(c)YOUTH SERVICES — HOUSING AND SEPARATION APPROPRIATION PROVISIONS. The Division of Youth Services (DYS) is authorized to fulfill its responsibility to house offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 and to separate juvenile offenders by age and seriousness of offense by either employing additional state employees and providing the corresponding operating expenses or entering into professional services contracts. If the Division of Youth Services determines that the Division needs to employ state employees to fulfill the housing and separation requirements, they may transfer up to the total amount appropriated for the DYS — Residential Services Program appropriation to the appropriate DYS appropriation and line items, upon approval of the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, and prior review by the Legislative Council; and
         </p>
         <p>
          “(d)REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES: (1) The Department of Human Services (DHS) provides hundreds of different services to over 1 million Arkansans. The specific mix of service needs and the funding and staffing required to provide them can vary significantly based on many factors, including natural disasters, changing federal mandates and funding sources, demographic shifts, fluctuating court-ordered services, social trends, and job market variations such as nursing shortages. The impact of these factors through the course of any fiscal year make it very difficult for the Department to accurately predict the exact needs for funding, appropriation and positions in each of its over 100 different appropriations. To ensure that it can respond quickly to changing client needs and make the most effective use of the resources allocated to it, the Department of Human Services shall be authorized to utilize the reallocation of resource authority to make the proper adjustments to the budgets within the Department. Therefore, upon determination by the Director of the Department of Human Services that a reallocation of resources within the department is necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the department, the director, with approval of the Governor, shall have the authority to request, from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, a transfer of positions, appropriations, line item appropriations, and funds within or between existing and newly created divisions, offices, sections, or units of the department. Provided, however, that no transfer of funds or appropriation that provides direct support or matching support for the Arkansas Medicaid Program shall be made to any other fund account or appropriation that does not directly support the Arkansas Medicaid Program. Further, no positions, funds, or appropriation authorized during the budget process for the Division of Children and Family Services compliance with initiatives established under the Angela R. consent decree shall be transferred to any other division. Nothing in this provision is intended to prevent the one-time transfers of savings in any other program to the Arkansas Medicaid Program, with the exception of the provisions previously cited for the Division of Children and Family Services — Angela R. consent decree. The Division of Developmental Disabilities — Grants to Community Providers line item of the Developmental Disabilities Services — Grants-in-Aid appropriation may not be decreased. The appropriation, funding, and positions provided for the five Human Development Centers shall remain at a level sufficient to ensure quality care for the Centers' residents. The exemptions provided in this subsection whereby certain DHS Programs and Divisions are protected from appropriation, fund, or position transfers are applicable only to the reallocation or transfer authority granted herein, and not by any reductions which are applicable to all state programs.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The Director of the Department of Human Services shall submit any requests for transfers to and must receive approval of the requests for transfers from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, the Governor, and the Arkansas Legislative Council prior to the effective date of the transfers. Provided, however, that the Department of Human Services shall be limited to submitting no more than two reallocation of resources transfer requests during any fiscal year. In each Departmental request no single division will request reallocation for more than one purpose as listed in this section. Transfer authority for unforeseen purposes shall further be limited to no more than 5% of the total appropriation, funding, and positions authorized for the Department. Reallocation of resources transfers may include multiple items but shall be limited to the following purposes:

This is usually accomplished by delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the Department of Human Services may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the Department of Human Services authorizing broad powers under the Reallocation of Resources provisions herein. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.

In addition, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, together with the Co-Chairpersons of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, may approve, on an emergency basis, requests for utilization of this Section without prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative Council, with any such actions reported at the next meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council.

Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that many services delivered by the various divisions, offices, and units the Department of Health and Human Services are essential to the public health, safety, and welfare; that the state fiscal year begins July 1; that beginning the process of decoupling the Division of Health of the Department of Health and Human Services from the Department of Health and Human Services during a fiscal year will cause disruptions of services and unnecessary time, effort, and expense in reallocating appropriations, budgets, personnel, equipment, and capital expenditures during a fiscal year; and that this act is immediately necessary because a delay beyond the beginning of the fiscal year will disrupt essential programs and services. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

             “Legislative findings and intent.
            </p>
            <p>
             “(a)The General Assembly finds:
            </p>
            <p>
             <p>
         “(1)The Administrative Procedure Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-202ol19A" target="_self">25-15-202(9)(A)</a></cite> defines ‘rule’ as ‘an agency statement of general applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice of an agency and includes, but is not limited to, the amendment or repeal of a prior rule’.
            </p>
            <p>
             “(2)While the term ‘regulation’ is not defined in the Administrative Procedure Act, the term is used interchangeably with the defined term ‘rule’ throughout the Arkansas Code;
            </p>
            <p>
             “(3)Use of the term ‘regulation’ out of the proper context creates confusion and inconsistency in the Arkansas Code;
            </p>
            <p>
             “(4)This act provides for the uniform use of the term ‘rule’ for an agency statement of general applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice of an agency and includes, but is not limited to, the amendment or repeal of a prior rule throughout the Arkansas Code as envisioned by defining of the term in the Administrative Procedures Act.
            </p>
            <p>
             “(b)It is the intent of the General Assembly that the uniform use of the term rule shall be applied to mean an agency statement of general applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice of an agency and includes, but is not limited to, the amendment or repeal of a prior rule, and includes a regulation”.

            </p>
            <p>
             “(1)It is common for acts of the General Assembly to delegate rulemaking authority to a state agency for the purpose of implementing and administering various duties and responsibilities;
            </p>
            <p>
             “(2)Broad interpretation of rulemaking authority by a state agency results in the state agency's supplanting the role of the General Assembly by effectively legislating in areas not intended by the General Assembly; and
            </p>
            <p>
             “(3)A state agency that has been delegated rulemaking authority should limit its rulemaking to only those areas absolutely necessary and should avoid broad applications or interpretations of its rulemaking power”.

            </p>
            <p>
             “(b)Acts 2019, No. 315 states that no governmental entity shall be required to re-promulgate existing regulations as rules solely to comply with this act.

            <p>

            <p>
             <p>
         “(d)To facilitate and ensure the use of the term ‘rule' by an agency when no update or change to the existing rule is expected or anticipated, the General Assembly finds that certain procedures under the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-201" target="_self">25-15-201</a></cite> et seq., may be waived.

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
             “(2)The agency files the updated rule with the Secretary of State on or before January 1, 2020; and
            </p>
            <p>
             “(3)A letter is provided to the Legislative Council by the agency stating that a rule has been filed with the Secretary of State's office, the name of the rule, a brief description of the rule, and an affirmative statement that the only change to the rule is a change from the use of the term ‘regulation' to the term ‘rule'.

             This subchapter has two purposes: to require certain designated state agencies to adopt and make public procedural rules, including methods whereby the public can make submissions or requests; and to afford adjudication rights in matters over which the agencies have jurisdiction.

             This subchapter was never designed nor intended to create supervisory responsibility by the judicial branch of state government over the day-to-day actions of the executive branch, including the hiring and firing of personnel, but rather, to establish procedures for hearings and notice (which meet due process requirements) in those functions of the executive branch which are basically adjudicatory or quasi-judicial, particularly with respect to rule making, the renewal or revocation of licenses, and situations where, under law, an agency of the state must make orders based on the adjudication process.

       (A)The right of an individual who is oral deaf to an interpreter may not be waived except by an individual who is oral deaf who does not use sign language and who initiates the request for a waiver in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       (A)If an individual who is deaf, deafblind, hard of hearing, or oral deaf reasonably expects the need for an interpreter to be for a period greater than a single day, the individual who is deaf, deafblind, hard of hearing, or oral deaf shall notify the appointing authority.

        Writ of mandamus was properly denied where a church and its affiliated university sought an exception from the certification requirements of the Arkansas Department of Higher Education; the church could have brought a declaratory action to determine whether or not the exception for programs that were predominantly religious in nature applied, and that was a determination to be made under the Department's administrative procedures.

   Dismissal of a psychologist's 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 claims under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine was affirmed where psychologist's federal court claims challenging application of certain regulations by the Arkansas Board of Examiners in Psychology were inseparable from psychologist's interest in upsetting a state court judgment effectively affirming the Board's application of the regulations; psychologist moved for voluntary dismissal of an appeal of the Board's decision to a state court under the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-201" target="_self">25-15-201</a></cite> to<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-217" target="_self">25-15-217</a></cite>, and the state court's dismissal of the action with prejudice effectively affirmed the Board's decision.

         State employee's appeal from her termination by a state school for the deaf could not be heard due to lack of jurisdiction because there was no judicial review of such termination decisions absent a public policy exception; such decisions were legislative rather than adjudicatory. The school's alleged violation of its non-mandatory reduction policy did not rise to the level of a public policy violation.Tripcony v. Ark. Sch. for the Deaf, 2012 Ark. 188, 403 S.W.3d 559 (2012).

           Circuit court did not err in granting beneficiaries of a state Medicaid program a temporary restraining order enjoining the Department of Human Services from conducting annual reassessments and reducing attendant-care hours as the beneficiaries demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits; the beneficiaries showed that the Department of Human Services did not substantially comply with this section in promulgating the new Resource Utilization Groups system methodology by failing to provide proper notice.Ark.

          <p>
           Department of Human Services (DHS) did not violate the express terms of a preliminary injunction order and was not in contempt where the order expressly barred it from using a Medicaid waiver methodology “unless or until it was properly promulgated” and days later DHS promulgated an emergency rule utilizing the same methodology without prior notice and opportunity for public comment. DHS complied with subsection (c) of this section when adopting the emergency rule by providing a written statement explaining its finding of imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare absent the emergency rule.Ark. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Ledgerwood, 2019 Ark. 121, 571 S.W.3d 911 (2019).
          </p>
          <p>
           As the Department of Human Services had the ability to modify the proposed rules, which plaintiff health care provider contended were fixed by contract prior to the expiration of the public comment period, the rule making was not in violation of this section.

         Beneficiaries of a state Medicaid program were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing their declaratory judgment action in the circuit court because any irreparable harm to the beneficiaries warranted application of the futility exception; also, subsection (d) of this section provided the beneficiaries the statutory scheme for seeking a declaratory judgment in lieu of pursuing the exhaustion of remedies.Ark.

        </p>
        <p>
         Declaratory relief is not proper when the identical questions involved in the declaratory judgment proceeding are already at issue between the parties in a pending action and declaratory judgment procedure is not proper as a means of trying a case, or various issues involved in it, by piecemeal.

         Where a church and its affiliated university sought an exception from certification requirements of the Arkansas Department of Higher Education, the church could have brought a declaratory action to determine whether or not the exception for programs that were predominantly religious in nature applied; thus, the church was not entitled to a writ of mandamus.

         Motion to dismiss on sovereign-immunity grounds filed by the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) and its director as to declaratory relief sought against DHS and the director in his official capacity was properly denied under this section, which waives sovereign immunity when a declaratory judgment is sought regarding the validity or applicability of an agency rule; this section allowed school districts to challenge a rule requiring licensed child-care centers to have general liability insurance.Ark.

         Circuit court properly denied a motion to dismiss on sovereign-immunity grounds filed by the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) and its director as to the injunctive relief sought against DHS and the director in his official capacity; where there is a permitted challenge to a rule under the declaratory-judgment statute, a request for injunctive relief is simply a means to enforce the judgment, should the circuit court determine that the rule is invalid or inapplicable.Ark.

     Circuit court had no subject-matter jurisdiction to review the licensing decision of the Medical Marijuana Commission (MMC) concerning cultivation facilities because (1) under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-212" target="_self">25-15-212</a></cite>, no “adjudication” as defined by statute occurred at the agency level and the MMC's decision was not quasi-judicial, and (2) under this section, the court only had jurisdiction to resolve a rule's validity or applicability, but the invalidity of a MMC rule was not pled, the “applicability” of a rule was not contested, and no declaration of whether a rule should have been applied was sought; instead, the complaints sought a declaration that the “application” of the MMC rules was improper, unfair, and arbitrary.Ark.

         <p>
     A broad reading of “applicability”, as to permit circuit courts to determine whether the agency complied with the rules, would largely eliminate the notice and hearing requirements of the Arkansas Adminstrative Procedure Act and would swallow §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-212" target="_self">25-15-212</a></cite> entirely.Ark.

         Supreme Court of Akansas did not address whether Rule 19 of the Medical Marijuana Commission conveyed subject-matter jurisdiction to the circuit court; although that rule provided that a denial of a cultivation license may be appealed to the circuit court, the issue was not ripe because the appellees had not been issued denial letters subsequent to an adjudication.Ark.

         It seems to be now a recognized doctrine that requires administrative relief to be sought before resorting to declaratory procedure, wherever administrative relief is afforded and this requirement is not one merely requiring the initiation of administrative procedure, but the administrative procedure must be pursued to its final conclusion before resort may be had to the court for declaratory relief.

         Appellants were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before they filed a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of § 200.3.2 of the Minimum Licensing Standards for Child Welfare Agencies because appellants, who would all be prohibited under the regulation from becoming foster parents because there were adult homosexuals in their homes, had shown that the threat of injury to them would justify having the regulation reviewed.

         Circuit court properly dismissed a physician's complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Arkansas State Medical Board where the statutes and regulations he sought to challenge did not completely bar any class of physicians from a certain act, and he failed to pursue the administrative remedy afforded him.Ahmad v.

         When a rule (or declaratory order) has a direct effect on the day-to-day business operations of an insurance company and places that company in a dilemma regarding the full range of property and casualty insurance, the issue is a fit subject for judicial review and a petition for declaratory relief.

             Revocation of an insurance license was upheld because hearing notice sent by the Arkansas Insurance Department provided sufficient warnings of the allegations against a title insurance company owner; a detailed description of the precise instances of misconduct was not required. The notice plainly charged the owner with diverting or misappropriating escrow funds, and it reasonably informed the owner of the type of violations that were later cited in the Department's order as a basis for revocation.Dyer v. Ark. Ins. Dep't, 2015 Ark. App. 446, 468 S.W.3d 303 (2015).

             In a case involving the revocation of an insurance license, even though challenged documents likely contained hearsay, the rules of evidence are relaxed in an administrative proceeding; moreover, the owner had the ability to subpoena witnesses to call the document preparers himself, or he could have asked for a continuance or a rehearing. Therefore, the administrative refusal to exclude the evidence outright was upheld.Dyer v. Ark. Ins. Dep't, 2015 Ark. App. 446, 468 S.W.3d 303 (2015).

         The case law strictly interpreting subdivision (b)(2) of this section would only be applicable to those cases where notice and a hearing are both required. In contrast, given the informal nature of the branch bank application procedure, the state bank commissioner's findings of fact are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.23.html#t23c32s23-32-1203ol1f" target="_blank">23-32-1203(f)</a></cite>.

             Failure to allow response to proposed findings of fact or hearing with regard thereto and adoption of proposed findings was not arbitrary and capricious nor an abuse of discretion where opposing counsel was provided with copy of proposed findings and failed to submit any modifications or comments or any findings of its own.

             Board's actions in 1993 were not tantamount to a reopening of the issue of fireman's retirement benefits granted in 1989; if fireman presented any information about, or evidence of, a work-related injury to the Board, it was not included in the record and the record did not contain any medical information provided by fireman to support a reopening nor any evidence of fraud, mistake, or misconception of facts that would have supported a reopening of the earlier claim, and thus Board did not fail to comply with this section because there was no adjudication on the merits.

         Fireman's appeal from his termination from the city fire department was dismissed for want of jurisdiction as the civil service commission, in affirming the termination, made no written order nor any findings of fact or conclusions of law as required by §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.14.html#t14c51s14-51-308ol1e1Bii" target="_blank">14-51-308(e)(1)(B)(ii)</a></cite>; accordingly, the matter was reversed and remanded so that the trial court could dismiss the appeal without prejudice, allowing the fireman to refile his appeal with the circuit court after the commission entered a written order.

             Remand of a police officer's application for retirement benefits was required because the administrative board had not made appropriate findings of fact as required by subdivision (b)(2) of this section. While the board's order had the labels “findings of fact” and “conclusions of law,” it was merely a procedural history of the administrative process and contained no information stating the facts upon which the board made its decision.Spriggs v.

             Where an appraiser was sanctioned by the appraiser board for a deficient appraisal, although the findings did not explain precisely how the appraiser could have remedied the deficiencies in his appraisal, the law does not require this level of specificity; the findings explained the portion of the appraisal that the board deemed deficient, and by reviewing those findings, the court could determine whether the board conformed with the law.Reynolds v.

     Under the flexible Mathews factors, the procedural avenues afforded by the Sex Offender Registration Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.12.html#t12c12s12-12-901" target="_blank">12-12-901</a></cite> et seq., were constitutionally adequate and provided notice to offenders of the risk assessment process and a meaningful opportunity to be heard; the Registration Act provides for an adversarial judicial review of the Committee's administrative review decision, with the full procedural guarantees set forth in the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, and it was unlikely that a right to counsel or to confront witnesses at the initial assessment stage would have appreciably reduced the risk of an erroneous determination.Weems v. Little Rock Police Dep't, 453 F.3d 1010 (8th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">550 U.S. 917</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 2128</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">167 L.

         Although a local utility customer failed to file a notice of appeal to the circuit court as required under Ark. Dist. Ct. R. 9, which applied to an appeal from the municipal utility's decision, but instead filed a complaint alleging that it was seeking judicial review of a final administrative order, the complaint properly described the final administrative decision and specified the date of that decision as required.Mt.

         Where appellant failed to make the required statutory showing that additional evidence which he wanted to present was material and that there were good reasons for his failure to present it to the commission, the circuit court did not err in affirming commission's decision.

         The trial court should first view the application for additional evidence to determine if the party was diligent and then determine if the application merely has general or conclusory statements as to the additional evidence. If the trial court finds that additional evidence should be taken, it must then remand the case to the board for it to hear the additional evidence. Marshall v. ABC Bd., 15 Ark.

         There was substantial evidence supporting the court's finding that there were good reasons for the failure of the applicant for retail liquor and off-premises beer permit to present evidence as to the public convenience and advantage before the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, where the director, in denying the application, indicated the deficiencies in the application were only the adequacy of the building and the adequacy of police protection; therefore, the court properly ordered additional evidence to be taken.

     After an appeal of a sex offender adjudication was dismissed on the ground that it could not be concluded that appellant had received notice of the Arkansas Department of Corrections Sex Offender Screening and Risk Assessment Committee's (SOSRA's) final decision, the court denied SOSRA's petition for rehearing because §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.12.html#t12c12s12-12-922ol1b6A" target="_blank">12-12-922(b)(6)(A)</a></cite> and (7)(A) required SOSRA to send “findings” to appellant, which proscription was consistent with the requirements of the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act under subsection (a) of this section.Munson v.

         State employee's appeal from her termination by a state school for the deaf could not be heard due to lack of jurisdiction because there was no judicial review of such termination decisions absent a public policy exception; such decisions were legislative rather than adjudicatory.

         The rules governing judicial review of administrative decisions are identical for both the circuit and appellate courts, and it is the decision of the agency, rather than that of the circuit court, which the appellate court reviews.

         Because an appraiser's argument that the circuit court erred in determining that she was not permitted to present additional evidence before the agency pursuant to the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, subsection (f) of this section was not ruled on by the Arkansas Appraiser Licensing and Certification Board; the supreme court was precluded from considering the argument on appeal; at the circuit court's hearing, the appraiser requested the circuit court to remand the case to present additional evidence pursuant to subsection (f), but she failed to obtain a ruling on the issue.Chandler v.

         Where plaintiffs were forced to choose whether to proceed under this section or de novo review provision of alcoholic beverage control laws and the de novo review statute they elected to pursue their remedy under was subsequently declared unconstitutional, the plaintiffs would be treated as if they had only made a mistake and not an irrevocable election of remedies and would be allowed to proceed under this section.

        <p>
         Appeal from agency decision dismissed where appellant failed to allege that he had sustained or was immediately in danger of sustaining injury either in his “person, business or property” as a consequence of the decision since only a claimant who has a personal stake in the outcome of a controversy has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the circuit court in order to seek remedial relief; his injury must be concrete, specific, real and immediate rather than conjectural or hypothetical.

         Inmate's petition failed to sustain a claim under this section to support a judicial review of the Arkansas Department of Corrections'decision because it did not set forth facts to show deprivation of a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause; the inmate alleged only a breach of contractual terms and that the DOC rules interfered with his right to correspond or otherwise communicate with persons not in prison.Renfro v.

        </p>
        <p>
         Because the circuit court summarily denied an inmate's petition to proceed in forma pauperis, a record of the entire proceedings was not lodged in the circuit court pursuant to subsection (d) of this section; the inmate stated a colorable claim that had to be evaluated in light of the entire record, and he was, therefore, entitled to proceed in forma pauperis.Ruiz v.

        </p>
        <p>
         Judicial review of administrative complaints is generally unavailable to inmates unless a constitutional violation is sufficiently alleged. When an inmate challenges a disciplinary proceeding and prison officials'implementation of Department of Correction policy, the petition must allege a constitutional question sufficient to raise a liberty interest.Muntaqim v. Kelley, 2019 Ark. 240, 581 S.W.3d 496 (2019).
        </p>

         Circuit court did not err in denying an inmate's petition to proceed in forma pauperis on his claims that prison officials initiated and conducted a disciplinary proceeding against him in violation of his constitutional rights because the Department of Correction officials did not violate his right to due process as there was no liberty interest protecting against a 20-day assignment to punitive isolation; and the inmate's claim that disciplinary charges were brought against him in retaliation for his exercising his right to seek redress of grievances failed to support his petition because the disciplinary charges were supported by “some evidence” that the inmate had threatened and acted insolently toward prison officials.Muntaqim v. Kelley, 2019 Ark. 240, 581 S.W.3d 496 (2019).

         There was no final agency action necessary for purposes of judicial review under this section because a doctor voluntarily surrendered the doctor's medical license before the board could render a decision on the doctor's requests for a closed hearing and voluntary restriction of the doctor's license; the circuit court correctly found that it lacked jurisdiction.Baber v.

         The judicial review provisions of this subchapter are not applicable to the discharge of an employee; the discharge of an employee is not an adjudication but administrative decision and the circuit court is without jurisdiction to review such actions.

         The administrative remedy available to the State Medical Board before the State Board of Dental Examiners on its claim that a dentist, with the aid of the State Board of Dental Examiners, engaged in the unlawful practice of medicine was inadequate and, therefore, the chancery court had jurisdiction over the matter.

         Reviewing court lacked jurisdiction to consider the supplier's appeal, because the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the matter, when the decision of the Office of State Procurement did not emanate from a hearing and the Office did not issue an order containing any findings of fact; administratively, the Office merely determined that the supplier's protest could not be heard, therefore, the decision did not come within the purview of the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, and thus the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to review it.Fatpipe, Inc. v.

     Circuit court had no subject-matter jurisdiction to review the licensing decision of the Medical Marijuana Commission (MMC) concerning cultivation facilities because (1) under this section, no “adjudication” as defined by statute occurred at the agency level and the MMC's decision was not quasi-judicial, and (2) under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-207" target="_self">25-15-207</a></cite>, the court only had jurisdiction to resolve a rule's validity or applicability, but the invalidity of a MMC rule was not pled, the “applicability” of a rule was not contested, and no declaration of whether a rule should have been applied was sought; instead, the complaints sought a declaration that the “application” of the MMC rules was improper, unfair, and arbitrary.Ark.

         Supreme Court of Akansas did not address whether Rule 19 of the Medical Marijuana Commission conveyed subject-matter jurisdiction to the circuit court; although that rule provided that a denial of a cultivation license may be appealed to the circuit court, the issue was not ripe because the appellees had not been issued denial letters subsequent to an adjudication.Ark.

         Alleged procedural irregularities in administration of market conduct examination, results of which formed basis of State Insurance Commissioner's finding, were not matters of record before the commissioner; therefore, the court could take evidence about these matters as they went towards alleged irregularities in procedure not in the record and could support a showing of discriminatory treatment of insurer.

         An administrative agency was not required to file an answer to a complaint which was in the nature of a petition for review of a final decision of the agency; the agency met the requirement of subsection (d) by filing the original or a certified copy of the record of the proceeding under review.

         Declining to award a former certified nursing assistant a default judgment against the Department of Human Services (DHS) based on its failure to timely file the record on appeal was not error as default judgment was not an appropriate remedy for an appeal from an administrative proceeding. Additionally, DHS had received an extension of time to file the record, and the record was filed within 90 days as required by subdivision (d)(1) of this section.Snyder v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 2018 Ark. App. 473, 559 S.W.3d 771 (2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the administrative record was not filed in the circuit court due to an “inadvertent oversight”, the administrative record could not be filed directly with the appellate court, bypassing the circuit court, because the “reviewing court” in subdivision (d)(1) of this section was the lower court and not the appellate court. Furthermore, it had been more than 90 days from the service of the petition.Webb v. Sex Offender Assessment Comm., 2020 Ark. App. 30 (2020) (per curiam).

         Case was sent back to the Arkansas State Board of Chiropractic Examiners because the Board's final order imposing a fine on the chiropractors and placing them on probation for committing eight “unprofessional conduct” violations was not specific enough given the many issues in play and the voluminous agency record.Ark.

        <p>
         In view of the fact that administrative decisions are not reviewed de novo, the agency, and not the reviewing court, is in a position to observe witnesses and consider their demeanor and conduct so that the credibility of witnesses and the proper weight to be accorded evidence adduced is a prerogative of the agency, not the reviewing court.

         Upon review of the actions of an administrative board or agency, the circuit court's review of the evidence is limited to a determination of whether there was substantial evidence to support the action taken, and upon appeal, the Supreme Court's review of the evidence is similarly limited. Ark. Real Estate Comm'n v. Harrison, 266 Ark. 339, 585 S.W.2d 34 (1979); Arkansas Real Estate Comm'n v. Hale, 12 Ark. App. 229, 674 S.W.2d 507 (1984).

        </p>
        <p>
         The rules governing judicial review of administrative decisions are the same for both the circuit and appellate courts and this review is limited in scope; administrative decisions will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by an abuse of discretion.

        <p>
         The reviewing court may not displace the board's choice between two fairly conflicting views even though the court might have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo; the reviewing court may not set aside a board's decision unless it cannot conscientiously find from a review of the entire record that the evidence supporting the decision is substantial. Fouch v. State, Alcoholic Beverage Control Div., 10 Ark. App. 139, 662 S.W.2d 181, 1983 Ark. App. LEXIS 935 (1983).

        </p>
        <p>
         Administrative agencies are better equipped than courts, by specialization, insight through experience, and more flexible procedures, to determine and analyze underlying legal issues affecting their agencies, and this recognition accounts for the limited scope of judicial review of administrative action, and the refusal of a trial court to substitute its judgment and discretion for that of an administrative agency.

        </p>
        <p>
         Where the trial court took three of the factors under subsection (h) into consideration: whether supported by substantial evidence, whether made upon unlawful procedure, and whether there existed arbitrary and capricious procedure, this was more than sufficient to satisfy this subchapter.

         An appellate court may reverse or modify an agency decision if the substantial rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are, inter alia, not supported by substantial evidence of record or are arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by an abuse of discretion.

        </p>
        <p>
         Decision by the Department of Human Services are governed by the Administrative Procedure Act; thus, the appellate court reviewed the decision of an agency who held that a school principal had abused a child when paddling him for discipline, rather than the trial court decision, to see if it was supported by substantial evidence.Ark.

     In conducting review, pursuant to this section, of a decision of the Arkansas State Medical Board, which revoked a physician's license based on a finding that he violated Regulation 2.7 by becoming sexually involved with a patient, the court found substantial evidence to uphold the decision because the evidence showed that the physician became romantically involved with a patient and subsequently ordered prescription medication for her; however, revocation of the physician's license to practice under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.17.html#t17c95s17-95-409" target="_blank">17-95-409</a></cite> was arbitrary and capricious based on the physician's unblemished professional record and based on the fact that he did not try to willfully violate the Regulations.

Ark. Veterinary Med. Examining Bd., 2010 Ark. App. 187, 375 S.W.3d 41 (2010).

        <p>
         Decision by the Appraiser Licensing and Certification Board that a real estate appraiser had violated several standards of appraisal practice was properly overturned because the Board's findings of fact did not correlate with its conclusions of law relating to the professional standards that it found that the appraiser had violated. Since the Board's conclusions of law were without adequate corresponding factual support, they lacked substantial evidence and were arbitrary and capricious.Ark. Appraiser Licensing v. Quast, 2010 Ark. App. 511 (2010).

         Because the Capitol Zoning District Commission's decision denying a property owner's application to install a 48-inch-high fence was supported by substantial evidence, it was not arbitrary and capricious.Capitol Zoning Dist. Comm'n v. Cowan, 2012 Ark. App. 619, 429 S.W.3d 267 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was substantial evidence to support the Capitol Zoning District Commission's decision denying a property owner's application to install a 48-inch-high fence. The owner's property was one of the most historic residences in all of Arkansas, and surrounding properties traditionally had fences at or under 40 inches in height.Capitol Zoning Dist. Comm'n v. Cowan, 2012 Ark. App. 619, 429 S.W.3d 267 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was substantial evidence to support the finding that the prior felony conviction should not be waived to allow the applicant to offer counseling, because the Arkansas Board of Examiners in Counseling found that the applicant's testimony that there would be no future aberrations in his behavior was not credible.Beavers v. Ark. Bd. of Examiners in Counseling, 2013 Ark. App. 222, 427 S.W.3d 130 (2013).

         Administrative law judge (ALJ) said the mother was carelessly swinging a belt at the child and knowingly struck him, but the two adverbs of “carelessly” and “knowingly” were diametrically opposed and invalidated the reasoning behind her conclusion that the mother abused her child, and the facts did not rise to the level of substantial evidence to support the ALJ's decision; the mother accidentally hit the child in the face as he was moving, which did not rise to the level of knowingly or intentionally as required by statute.Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., Div. of Children & Family Servs. v. Nelson, 2015 Ark. App. 98, 455 S.W.3d 859 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was substantial evidence to support the revocation of the license of a title insurance company owner because there was a longtime pattern of poor record-keeping, poor management, and questionable business practices that enabled the owner's employee to commit fraud; and the owner disregarded the sanctity of escrow accounts and failed to place correct information on title policies regarding his license, business name, and the required statutory notices. Moreover, the sanction was not too harsh because revocation was an available sanction for the violations that occurred.Dyer v. Ark. Ins. Dep't, 2015 Ark. App. 446, 468 S.W.3d 303 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Substantial evidence supported the decision of the Department of Human Services that a teacher had committed sexual abuse of a minor student and ordering that the teacher's name be placed in the Child Maltreatment Central Registry, even though the criminal charges had been dropped; the ALJ had clearly considered the teacher's defenses and rejected them, the appellate court does not act as a super factfinder, and the teacher could not complain that he was denied an opportunity to cross-examine the student when he failed to subpoena her.J.C. v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 2019 Ark. App. 131, 572 S.W.3d 878 (2019).

         Administrative action may be regarded as arbitrary and capricious only where it is not supportable on any rational basis. Partlow v. Arkansas State Police Comm'n, 271 Ark. 351, 609 S.W.2d 23 (1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         To set aside administrative action as arbitrary and capricious, it must be proven that it was willful and unreasoning action, without consideration and with a disregard of the facts or circumstances of the case. Partlow v. Arkansas State Police Comm'n, 271 Ark. 351, 609 S.W.2d 23 (1980); Ark. State Bd. of Nursing v. Long, 8 Ark. App. 288, 651 S.W.2d 109 (1983); Garner v. Foundation Life Ins. Co., 17 Ark. App. 13, 702 S.W.2d 417 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         The requirement that administrative action not be arbitrary or capricious is less demanding than the requirement that it be supported by substantial evidence; in order for the action to be invalid as arbitrary, the action must lack rational basis or hinge on a finding of fact based on an erroneous view of the law, and the action is not arbitrary simply because the reviewing court would act differently. Woodyard v. Arkansas Diversified Ins. Co., 268 Ark. 94, 594 S.W.2d 13 (1980); In re Sugarloaf Mining Co., 310 Ark. 772, 840 S.W.2d 172 (1992).

         Agency action held not arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by an abuse of discretion. Partlow v. Arkansas State Police Comm'n, 271 Ark. 351, 609 S.W.2d 23 (1980); Huth v. Division of Social Servs. of Dep't of Human Servs., 287 Ark. 294, 698 S.W.2d 789 (1985); Garner v. Foundation Life Ins. Co., 17 Ark. App. 13, 702 S.W.2d 417 (1986).

         Agency action held to be arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Division of Social Servs. v. Oak Hills Corp., 287 Ark. 32, 695 S.W.2d 836 (1985); Wright v. Ark. State Plant Bd., 311 Ark. 125, 842 S.W.2d 42 (1992).

         Even though the director for the Arkansas Tobacco Control Board sent the tobacco company an offer of settlement “recommending” a $500 fine for the tobacco company which gave unlawful rebates to retailers, and the company accepted the offer, the defense of agency estoppel was not preserved, and because the evidence established that the company had paid rebates to at least 28 Arkansas retail establishments, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Board to reject the “recommendation” and impose a $28,000 fine and suspension of the company's permit for six months. H.T. Hackney Co. v. Davis, 353 Ark. 797, 120 S.W.3d 79 (2003).

         Trial court determined that the administrative law judge acted arbitrarily in determining that the husband's annuity was purchased to assist the institutionalized spouse in qualifying for Medicaid benefits; however, the appellate court reversed and remanded for further findings as the Arkansas Department of Human Services did not properly complete the eligibility worksheet to determine eligibility. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Schroder, 353 Ark. 885, 122 S.W.3d 10 (2003).

     Administrative law judge's finding that a stepfather, who acted at the direction of and in concert with the natural mother in disciplining their children with respect to a specific incident, was not entitled to the protection of the reasonable and moderate discipline exception under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.12.html#t12c12s12-12-503ol12Ci" target="_blank">12-12-503(2)(C)(i)</a></cite>, was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.

        </p>
        <p>
         Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors'denial of the request for licensure reinstatement of appellants, a funeral director and her funeral establishment was not arbitrary and capricious because the record demonstrated that appellants engaged in a systematic course of committing violations, resulting in suspensions, probation, and ultimately revocation of their funeral-director and funeral-establishment licenses and that even after their licenses were revoked, appellants continued to conduct funerals in violation of the statutes.Collins v. Ark. Bd. of Embalmers & Funeral Dirs., 2013 Ark. App. 678, 430 S.W.3d 213 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         If an agency's action is supported by substantial evidence, then it follows automatically that the decision cannot be characterized as arbitrary and capricious.Reynolds v. Ark. Appraiser Licensing & Certification Bd., 2019 Ark. App. 587, 591 S.W.3d 837 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly reversed an administrative decision that parents neglected their children as there was no substantial evidence to support a finding that the children were placed in danger by the parents by allowing them to spend the night with their step-grandfather, a convicted sex offender, following their grandmother's death, especially where those visits went without any suggestion of abuse. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Bixler, 91 Ark. App. 277, 210 S.W.3d 135 (2005), rev'd, 364 Ark. 292, 219 S.W.3d 125 (2005).

         The requirement that the action of the board be supported by sufficient evidence does not place upon the board the burden of presenting evidence that a petition should be denied nor relieve the petitioner of the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to justify the granting of the petition.

         Substantial evidence supported agency decision. White County Guar. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. F & M Bank, 262 Ark. 893, 562 S.W.2d 582 (1978); Woodyard v. Arkansas Diversified Ins. Co., 268 Ark. 94, 594 S.W.2d 13 (1980); Garner v. Foundation Life Ins. Co., 17 Ark. App. 13, 702 S.W.2d 417 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Substantial evidence is valid, legal, and persuasive evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Partlow v. Arkansas State Police Comm'n, 271 Ark. 351, 609 S.W.2d 23 (1980); Ark. State Bd. of Nursing v. Long, 8 Ark. App. 288, 651 S.W.2d 109 (1983); Arkansas Real Estate Comm'n v. Hale, 12 Ark.

        </p>
        <p>
         On appeal, the court gives the evidence its strongest probative force in favor of the administrative agency. Williams v. Scott, 278 Ark. 453, 647 S.W.2d 115 (1983); Arkansas Dep't of Human Servs. v. Simes, 281 Ark. 81, 661 S.W.2d 378 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to establish an absence of substantial evidence to support the decision, the appellant must demonstrate that the proof before the administrative tribunal was so nearly undisputed that fair-minded men could not reach its conclusion. The question is not whether the testimony would have supported a contrary finding but whether it supports the finding that was made. Williams v. Scott, 278 Ark. 453, 647 S.W.2d 115 (1983); Wright v. Ark. State Plant Bd., 311 Ark. 125, 842 S.W.2d 42 (1992).

         Evidence insufficient to support agency decision. Arkansas Dep't of Human Servs. v. Simes, 281 Ark. 81, 661 S.W.2d 378 (1983); Fouch v. State, Alcoholic Beverage Control Div., 10 Ark. App. 139, 662 S.W.2d 181, 1983 Ark. App. LEXIS 935 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         Substantial evidence means relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion based on a review of the entire record. Woodyard v. Arkansas Diversified Ins. Co., 268 Ark. 94, 594 S.W.2d 13 (1980); Fouch v. State, Alcoholic Beverage Control Div., 10 Ark. App. 139, 662 S.W.2d 181, 1983 Ark. App. LEXIS 935 (1983).

         In applying subsection (h) to child abuse reporting cases, an administrative decision is reviewed under the same credible evidence standard, rather than the substantial evidence standard, however the remaining portions of that subsection remain in effect.

        <p>
         <p>
     Substantial evidence did not support the decision placing the employee on the certified nursing abuse registry because the administrative law judge did not make the requisite findings to support the violation she found; the administrative law judge concluded that the employee's conduct was abusive under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.05.html#t05c28s5-28-101ol11" target="_blank">5-28-101(1)</a></cite>, without specifying which of the two definitions of abuse in the provision she was applying.

         There was substantial evidence to support the Arkansas State Board of Physical Therapy's decision to suspend physical therapist, with probation thereafter, where during the hearing, there was evidence produced that the physical therapist and the patient engaged in kissing, hugging, and heavy petting during the course of her treatment, and there was also testimony that the physical therapist made very intimate and personal comments to the patient during treatment, and the two had intercourse within at least two weeks of the patient's final therapy session.

        <p>
         Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (ATRS) because substantial evidence supported its finding that a school district was responsible for paying the employer contribution to ATRS on settlement proceeds a teacher received and that it failed to follow the calculation of damages designated in the settlement as back pay.Palestine-Wheatley Sch. Dist. v. Hopkins, 2016 Ark. App. 112, 484 S.W.3d 682 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not fail to consider whether substantial evidence supported the decision of the Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System because it recited the standard of review applicable, specifically noting the standard of whether there was substantial evidence to support the agency's findings; the circuit court found that the decision of the administrative hearing officer from which the appeal arose was supported by substantial evidence.Palestine-Wheatley Sch. Dist. v. Hopkins, 2016 Ark. App. 112, 484 S.W.3d 682 (2016).

         Where an appraiser was sanctioned by the appraiser board for a deficient appraisal, the fact that the board's chief investigator did not review certain documents until the hearing did not, by itself, render the board's decision without substantial evidence to support it.Reynolds v. Ark. Appraiser Licensing & Certification Bd., 2019 Ark. App. 587, 591 S.W.3d 837 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court erred in dismissing with prejudice, based on sovereign immunity, an administrative appeal from final orders of the Oil and Gas Commission because sovereign immunity was not implicated where the commission was not “made a defendant” as contemplated by the state constitution; the commission's role in the proceeding was that of a tribunal or a quasi-judicial decision-maker rather than a real party in interest. It followed that the circuit court's rulings declaring the adjudicatory provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act unconstitutional and invalidating the commission's orders as void ab initio also were reversed.Ark. Oil & Gas Comm'n v. Hurd, 2018 Ark. 397, 564 S.W.3d 248 (2018).

        <p>
         The court rejected the contention that when an individual does not appear in the proceedings below, but seeks to appeal a final action under the Administrative Procedures Act, he must set out in his petition how the issuance of the permit will harm him; instead, in order to have standing, a petitioner must assert in his pleadings how he has already sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining injury either in his person, business, or property as a consequence of the final action.

     There is no need for Arkansas courts to resort to the requirements for standing under the federal Administrative Procedure Act when determining standing under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-212ol1a" target="_self">25-15-212(a)</a></cite>; a petitioner under the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act (APA), §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-201" target="_self">25-15-201</a></cite> to<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-217" target="_self">25-15-217</a></cite>, did not have to show an “injury in fact” and that such injury was within the “zone of interests” sought to be protected, as those terms were used under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, because the Arkansas APA did not have the same requirements as the federal Administrative Procedure Act.Ark.

         This section suggests that one is entitled to a hearing in person, with “in person” meaning that the petitioner, respondent, witnesses, and the hearing officer are in one location; thus, the circuit court properly concluded that a telephone hearing was not sufficient in a case involving the placement of a name on the child maltreatment registry.Ark.

         In a prospective buyer's challenge to a vehicle manufacturer's determination that the buyer was unqualified to purchase a dealership, a hearing officer's exclusion of a letter that could have been used for impeachment purposes as to allegations of past warranty fraud was prejudicial under subdivision (5) of this section.

         In a case involving the revocation of an insurance license, even though challenged documents likely contained hearsay, the rules of evidence are relaxed in an administrative proceeding; moreover, the owner had the ability to subpoena witnesses to call the document preparers himself, or he could have asked for a continuance or a rehearing. Therefore, the administrative refusal to exclude the evidence outright was upheld.Dyer v. Ark. Ins. Dep't, 2015 Ark. App. 446, 468 S.W.3d 303 (2015).

         Commission was properly reversed where fairness of one of the commissioners was subject to reasonable suspicion based upon statements made in relation to the matter involved in the hearing. Arkansas Racing Comm'n v. Emprise Corp., 254 Ark. 975, 497 S.W.2d 34 (1973).

     Board member held not disqualified by pronouncement prior to the conclusion of the hearing that the license should be suspended, where the comment was made after admissions of misconduct had already been made by licensee.

         Based on the existence and content of an ex parte communication, particularly when viewed in conjunction with the hearing officer's actions after the discussion was brought to light, the appearance of a fair hearing was compromised and the decision was properly reversed. Madden v. United States Assocs., 40 Ark. App. 143, 844 S.W.2d 374 (1992).

        <p>
         Although respondent had right to appear at hearing in person or by counsel, it was not required that notice of hearing recite these rights. Thomas v. Committee “A” Thomas, 255 Ark. 517, 255 Ark. 517, 501 S.W.2d 248, 1973 Ark. LEXIS 1398 (1973).

        <p>
         <p>
     Although this subchapter gives the respondent in an administrative proceeding the right to appear by counsel and to present and cross-examine witnesses, the administrative board is under no duty to warn respondents of such rights.

         Order requiring the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services to pay for an attorney for a child in its custody who had been accused of sexual misconduct was upheld where the child was entitled to an attorney under subdivision (1) of this section; providing the child with an attorney, in order to keep the child off the sex offender list, would greatly assist in the child's adoption.Ark.

        Attorney general's office did not have an irreconcilable conflict of interest in representing the Arkansas Board of Architects where it also represented the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors in disciplinary proceedings against engineers; the Attorney General was only representing the Board of Architects, not the Board of Engineering, and the latter board was in no way involved in this case.

While the Attorney General may intervene and defend the constitutionality of the Act in a private damages suit, the Attorney General does not initiate enforcement or seek relief against a putative defendant; thus, the companies'injury was “fairly traceable” only to the private civil litigants who may seek damages under the Act and the companies lacked standing to sue the Governor and Attorney General challenging the Act's constitutionality.Digital Recognition Network, Inc. v.

       25-16-806. Removal and replacement of positions without confirmation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      As used in this section:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)The Governor may remove for good cause an agency, board, or commission member whose office or position is filled by gubernatorial appointment that is not subject to confirmation by the Senate or a majority of senators.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governor may appoint a qualified individual to replace the removed member to serve the remainder of the removed member's term.
     </p>
     <p>
      All orders of removal by the Governor shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      Be in writing;
     </p>
     <p>
      Be delivered to the removed member or counsel for the member; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Removal of an agency, board, or commission member shall be in accordance with the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)Within thirty (30) calendar days after each regular agency, board, or commission meeting, the secretary of the agency, board, or commission shall notify the Governor in writing of any member who has been absent from three (3) successive regular meetings without attending any intermediary called special meetings.
     </p>
     <p>
      An agency, board, or commission member referred to the Governor because of excessive absences under the provisions of this section shall not be entitled to any per diem, stipend, or expense reimbursement for travel to or attendance at subsequent meetings until the agency, board, or commission receives notification from the Governor that the member has been excused for the absences.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)A removed member may institute proceedings for review by filing a petition in Pulaski County Circuit Court within thirty (30) days after delivery to him or her or his or her attorney of the Governor's order of removal.
     </p>
     <p>
      This petition shall not supersede or stay the order of removal, nor shall any court enter an order to this effect or one which would impair the authority of the Governor to appoint a replacement whose service begins immediately upon fulfillment of the normal requirements for assuming office.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)When the matter is heard by the Pulaski County Circuit Court, the matter shall be tried de novo without a jury.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governor shall have the burden of proof to show by clear and convincing evidence that good cause existed for removal of the agency, board, or commission member in question from office and for revoking his or her commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)If the court determines that good cause has been shown, it shall enter an order removing the member in question from office and revoking his or her commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governor may appeal the decision of the circuit court to the Supreme Court, but the appeal shall not preclude the circuit court, in its discretion, from entering an order reinstating the removed member.

It is found, therefore, that delay in the effective date of this act will create confusion by reason of the uncertain status of present board members, and, that in order to preserve the public peace, health, and safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1995, No. 1192, § 7: Apr. 11, 1995.

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1997, No. 250, § 258: Feb. 24, 1997. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 1211 of 1995 established the procedure for all state boards and commissions to follow regarding reimbursement of expenses and stipends for board members; that this act amends various sections of the Arkansas Code which are in conflict with the Act 1211 of 1995; and that until this cleanup act becomes effective conflicting laws will exist. Therefore an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill.

           </p>
           <p>
            “(a)As used in this section, ‘state agency’ means an agency, institution, authority, department, board, commission, bureau, council, or other agency of the State of Arkansas supported by cash funds or the appropriation of state or federal funds.
           </p>
           <p>
            “(b)(1)The General Assembly finds that:
           </p>
           <p>
            “(A)State agencies contain great amounts of valuable information and reports on all aspects of life for the citizens of this state, including without limitation health, business, public safety, labor, and transportation data;
           </p>
           <p>
            “(B)The tremendous amount of data maintained by state agencies can result in the duplication of efforts, data, records, and parts of data and records that may result in the maintenance of inconsistent data and records concerning the same citizen;
           </p>
           <p>
            “(C)The lack of a quick and efficient delivery system to respond to legislative and executive branch inquiries is harmful to the policy-making process and ultimately costs taxpayers money;
           </p>
           <p>
            “(D)Progressive states have evolved to become data-driven governments that use data as a strategic asset to improve the delivery of services to the state's citizens and to become more efficient stewards of citizens' data;
           </p>
           <p>
            “(E)Ensuring the quality and consistency of public data is essential to maintaining the data's value and utility;
           </p>
           <p>
            “(F)New information technology has fundamentally changed the way people search for and expect to find information and can aggregate large quantities of data to allow the state to provide better information to citizens with increasing efficiency and thoroughness; and
           </p>
           <p>
            “(G)The state should:
           </p>
           <p>
            “(i)Evaluate ways to appropriately, efficiently, and securely share data between and within state agencies to allow for quicker, more impactful cross-agency analysis to allow policymakers to make quicker, more informed decisions; and
           </p>
           <p>
            “(ii)Use the innovations in information technology to enhance public access to public data to make the state more transparent and to promote public trust while eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the execution and delivery of government services.
           </p>
           <p>
            “(2)It is the intent of the General Assembly by this act to enable the Open Data and Transparency Task Force to:

            “(C)Recommend specific solutions and legislation for an efficient open data and transparency law based upon open data policy principles for state agencies to maintain and share public data that is owned, controlled, collected, or maintained by state agencies.
           </p>
           <p>

            “Whereas, the Board of Fiscal Control recognized the necessity of microfilming invaluable state documents and records as a protection against fire and other hazards, to conserve valuable storage space in the State Capitol Building, and to comply with federal statutes allowing such microfilm records and facisimiles to be admitted as evidence in all courts, departments, bureaus, and commissions, on the same status as the original documents or records; and

           <p>
            “Whereas, the federal government, other states, and many counties in Arkansas are now microfilming their land and other records and it is highly important that state land and other state records and documents be microfilmed for the use of federal, state, and county officials, and employees, and the public generally;

Emergency clause provided: “There being no provision of law whereby photostatic microfilm or photographic reproductions of writings, documents, or records may be admissible in evidence, and because facilities for storage of public records are now taxed to capacity; and because space must be provided for such public records and because it is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety of the inhabitants of the state; an emergency exists within the meaning of the Constitution and this act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that Act 170 of 1947, as amended, requires all state agencies, and all cities and counties, to file copies of various documents and publications with the General Library of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville; and it is further determined by the General Assembly that in order to make documents of the state, cities, and counties more readily accessible to the public at convenient locations throughout the state, and for use by students and the public at state-supported institutions of higher learning, it is essential that all state, city, and county agencies be required to furnish copies of printed publications to the libraries of the various state-supported institutions of higher learning; that only by the immediate passage of this act may prompt implementation of the provisions of this act be carried out. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 1993.”

       The General Assembly finds that while the Freedom of Information Act of 1967, § 25-19-101 et seq., provides disclosure guarantees for public records, due to Acts 2001, No. 1252, there is no general requirement for agencies to preserve public records.

     A.C.R.C. Notes. Acts 2015, No. 186, § 1, provided:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Legislative findings and intent.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(a)The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(1)On April 3, 2014, in the case of Hopkins v. City of Brinkley, 2014 Ark. 139, 432 S.W.3d 609 (2014), the Supreme Court determined that neither the Freedom of Information Act of 1967, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> et seq., nor federal law currently offers protection for the personal information of customers of municipally owned utility systems;
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(2)Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act of 1967, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> et seq., in recent years have provided exceptions to disclosure for personal contact information of state, county, school, and municipal employees, but have provided no such protection for municipal utility customers;
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(3)The Arkansas Public Service Commission has traditionally and consistently protected the personal contact information of public utility customers by exercising its authority under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.23.html#t23c02s23-2-316ol1b" target="_blank">23-2-316(b)</a></cite>, finding that the protection of such information is in the public interest;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(4)Smart meters, which can record and transmit detailed data on a customer's use of a utility, present unique privacy concerns, as evidenced by a 2012 report of the United States Department of Energy on smart grid privacy that included recommendations that customer data be protected from release to third parties;
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(5)Recent amendments to the Freedom of Information Act of 1967, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> et seq., have also provided disclosure exemptions for sensitive infrastructure information of public water systems;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(6)The federal government recognizes the importance of critical infrastructure information, and has created special policies to address its protection, including without limitation:
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(A)The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002, <cite class="us_code">6 U.S.C. § 131</cite> et seq., which prohibits federal agencies from disclosing certain information submitted to the United States Department of Homeland Security; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “(B)Rules of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission addressing critical energy infrastructure information, which limit access to certain information generated or collected by the commission and require the use of nondisclosure agreements when the information is provided; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “(7)It is necessary to protect the security of the infrastructure of Arkansas's utility systems, including without limitation electric generation, transmission, and distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(b)It is the intent of this act to:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(1)Protect the privacy of Arkansas citizens by exempting from disclosure the personal information of customers of municipally owned utility systems; and
    </p>
    <p>
     “(2)Ensure the security of Arkansas's infrastructure by exempting utility infrastructure information from mandatory disclosure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 2017, No. 1107, § 1, provided: “Legislative findings and intent.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(a)The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(1)It is vital to a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and public manner so that the electors are advised of the performance of public officials and of the decisions that are reached in public activity and in making public policy;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(2)Under the current law, state agencies, boards, and commissions must prepare and make available on the internet certain information, free of charge;
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(3)Upon the state agency, board, or commission providing the information on the internet, the information provided is deemed a sufficient response to a request to inspect the materials, unless the requestor specifies another medium or format under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105" target="_self">25-19-105</a></cite>;
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(4)The provisions of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105" target="_self">25-19-105</a></cite>, while ensuring transparency, have the added benefit of diminishing compliance costs associated with large, complicated, and frequent requests for public records, as the state agency, board, or commission is deemed compliant by providing the legally specified information on the internet;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(5)However, the current law does not afford local governments, including their boards and instrumentalities, the ability to increase transparency and efficiency by the means available to state agencies, boards, and commissions;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(6)Local governments often receive large, complicated, and frequent requests for public records, requiring additional staff and resources to which the local government must dedicate its limited resources;
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(7)Local governments should have the discretion to make all or part of the information listed under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105" target="_self">25-19-105</a></cite> available on the internet and, upon publication, be deemed in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act of 1967, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> et seq., for those records; and
    </p>
    <p>
     <p>
   “(8)While not every local government has the resources to comply with all or part of the provisions included under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105" target="_self">25-19-105</a></cite>, allowing local governments the option to comply with all or part of the provisions under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105" target="_self">25-19-105</a></cite>, and be deemed compliant concerning those records, would allow local governments to be more effective stewards of taxpayer dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(b)It is the intent of the General Assembly to allow local governments the opportunity to be more transparent, while reducing the burden on local governments' limited resources, thereby reducing the financial cost to taxpayers of additional staff and other resources.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(c)It is not the intent of the General Assembly to:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(1)Allow the custodian or government entity to act in bad faith to avoid transparency; or
    </p>
    <p>
     “(2)Place an unreasonable burden on local governments.”

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect after its passage and approval.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act require notice of emergency on special meetings of school boards to be given only to those newspapers located in the county in which the meeting is to be held; that in some instances the principal newspaper serving the patrons of the district is printed outside the county in which the district is located; that it is essential to the effective and efficient administration of each school district that notice of such meetings be given to the principal newspaper serving the patrons of the district when the newspaper requests such notice; that this Act requires such notice and should be given effect at the earliest practical date. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 1987, No. 49, § 5: Feb. 16, 1987. Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that considerable confusion has existed regarding public access to personnel records and employee evaluation records under Act 93 of 1967, as amended; that Act 17 of 1986, Second Extraordinary Session, which exempts employee evaluation records from disclosure, by its own terms ceases to be effective on April 1, 1987; that, as a general matter, the confidentiality of personnel records and employee evaluation records is in the public interest to ensure the privacy of employees and the efficacy of the employee evaluation process; that such records should, however, be open to public inspection in certain circumstances; that guidance from the Attorney General and additional enforcement mechanisms, including attorney fees, litigation costs, and criminal penalties, are necessary to implement the provisions of this Act regarding such records; and that this Act is designed to clarify the law with respect to such records and should be given effect immediately. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
    </p>

Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”

Emergency clause provided: “It is hereby found and determined by the General Assembly that present law is unclear concerning the confidentiality of the records obtained by the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission in the recruitment of industry to this State, and the disclosure of such information under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act would seriously jeopardize other recruitment efforts of the Commission, since this information is given to the Commission under an agreement of confidentiality. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Acts 2001, No. 1653, § 5: Apr. 16, 2001. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly that confusion exists as to the status of electronic records under the Freedom of Information Act of 1967, as amended; that the right to obtain copies of public records at a reasonable cost is uncertain; that access to certain electronic records may adversely affect the security of computer systems and networks maintained by public entities; and that access to certain student records maintained in electronic form by school districts, institutions of higher education, and state agencies may jeopardize federal funding. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor.

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

To deter such acts, and to protect the security of public water systems, the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act should be amended immediately to exempt vulnerability assessments created on or before June 30, 2004, from disclosure. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on: (1) The date of its approval by the Governor; (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill; or (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.”

   Arkansas Department of Human Services was a department of the State of Arkansas and a suit against a state official in his official capacity was not a suit against that person but, rather, was a suit against that official's office, thus, even though the individual prevailed in obtaining certain public records under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> et seq., under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-107ol1d" target="_self">25-19-107(d)</a></cite>, no award of attorney's fees could be assessed against either the Department or the director, who was acting as a state official in his official capacity; further, as an individual, the director had no administrative control of the public records as he would have had control of the public records only in his official capacity.

      It is vital in a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and public manner so that the electors shall be advised of the performance of public officials and of the decisions that are reached in public activity and in making public policy. Toward this end, this chapter is adopted, making it possible for them or their representatives to learn and to report fully the activities of their public officials.

       The objectives of this chapter are such that whenever the legislature fails to specify that any records in the public domain are to be excluded from inspection, or is less than clear in its intendments, then privacy must yield to openness and secrecy to the public's right to know the status of its own affairs; therefore, the burden of confidentiality rests on the legislation itself, and if the intention is doubtful, openness is the result.

     Locus of a record is important only to determine whether the record falls under the presumption in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-103ol15A" target="_self">25-19-103(5)(A)</a></cite> of the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, and the definition of “public record” is not dependent upon who keeps the record or where it is kept, just that it either is required to be kept or is otherwise kept. Fox v. Perroni, 358 Ark. 251, 188 S.W.3d 881 (2004).

     Where the records in question are established as “public records” pursuant to subdivision (1) of the this section and not otherwise exempted from disclosure, the appropriate governmental agency shall have the responsibility to provide reasonable access for examination and copying of such public records which are in existence at the time of the request, as provided in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105" target="_self">25-19-105</a></cite>.

     Circuit judge's law clerk's personal check was a public record under this section, and the circuit judge was its custodian and had to disclose the check to an attorney and his counsel pursuant to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105" target="_self">25-19-105</a></cite> where the circuit judge instructed his clerk to obtain copies of certain documents from a federal court for use in contempt proceedings against the attorney, and where the attorney and his counsel sought disclosure of the check under FOIA.

        Seed sample did not meet the definition of a “public record” because it could not be said to be an object on which records and information may be stored or represented; the list of items that could be mediums did not contain a seed or any other object, and removal and destructive testing of seed samples went far beyond the inspection and copying of public records.

     Legal opinions rendered in tax cases under Gross Receipts Tax Rule G-75 are subject to disclosure to a company because they are “otherwise kept” public records under subdivision (5)(A) of this section; however, any and all identifying facts and information have to be fully redacted under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105ol1f1" target="_self">25-19-105(f)(1)</a></cite>–(3). Moreover, the legal opinions are not confidential because §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.26.html#t26c18s26-18-303ol1a1" target="_blank">26-18-303(a)(1)</a></cite> does not cover Gross Receipts Tax Rule G-75; state law does not require that the opinions be kept by or filed with the Director of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.Ryan &amp; Co. v. Weiss, 371 Ark. 43, 263 S.W.3d 489 (2007).

        Circuit court did not clearly err in finding that the city clerk's destruction of the adding-machine tape did not amount to a violation of the Freedom of Information Act of 1967 where the city clerk testified that the relevant numbers had been recorded on other budget-meeting documents, the adding-machine tape was not meaningful nor was it something the city ever kept, and she gave the plaintiff citizen everything she had when he asked for it; plaintiff failed to prove that the adding-machine tape was required to be kept.Pitchford v. City of Earle, 2019 Ark. App. 251, 576 S.W.3d 103 (2019).

   Circuit court's determination that this section and §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-106" target="_self">25-19-106</a></cite> were unconstitutional was improper because declaratory relief was inappropriate under this section as appellees did not yet have a case or controversy ready for decision by the courts. Appellees received a legal opinion on the effects of certain provisions of the state's Freedom of Information Act rather than resolution of an actual controversy.McCutchen v.

        There is a rational basis for exempting the working papers of the governor, the legislators, and the supreme court justices from public disclosure. Such protection promotes and encourages free exchange of thought in each of the three branches of government. McCambridge v. City of Little Rock, 298 Ark. 219, 766 S.W.2d 909 (1989).
       </p>

        The attorney-client privilege has no application outside of court proceedings and, therefore, cannot create an exception to the Freedom of Information Act. McCambridge v. City of Little Rock, 298 Ark. 219, 766 S.W.2d 909 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (a)(1)(B) of this section, which permits an incarcerated felon to request information of public record only through an attorney, did not violate the inmate's due process right to access the courts because the inmate suffered no actual injury from the statute, as he had rights available to him through habeas petition.Holt v. Howard, 806 F.3d 1129 (8th Cir. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (a)(1)(B) of this section, which permits an incarcerated felon to request information of public record only through an attorney, does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause because the statute is rationally related to preventing the use of records to harass or threaten victims or witnesses and to conserving government resources.Holt v. Howard, 806 F.3d 1129 (8th Cir. 2015).

        This chapter does not require a court to provide, free of charge, a copy of material on file with the court; a petitioner is not entitled to photocopying at public expense unless he demonstrates some compelling need for specific documentary evidence to support an allegation contained in a petition for post-conviction relief.

        The Freedom of Information Act should be broadly construed in favor of disclosure, and exceptions construed narrowly in order to counterbalance the self-protective instincts of the governmental bureaucracy. McCambridge v. City of Little Rock, 298 Ark. 219, 766 S.W.2d 909 (1989); Bryant v. Mars, 309 Ark. 480, 830 S.W.2d 869 (1992).

       <p>
        Acts 1989 (3rd Ex. Sess.), No. 8 was not merely remedial or procedural in nature, but created new exemptions from public disclosure which did not exist before. Statutes which are remedial or procedural generally supply new, different, or more appropriate remedies which relate to existing rights, and do not create new rights or extinguish old ones. Gannett River States Publishing Co. v. Arkansas Indus. Dev. Comm'n, 303 Ark. 684, 799 S.W.2d 543 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any exemption from disclosure is to be narrowly construed, and when the scope of an exemption is unclear or ambiguous, the court will interpret it in a manner that favors disclosure. Young v. Rice, 308 Ark. 593, 826 S.W.2d 252 (1992).

        Trial court erred by finding that the driver received a timely and compliant response from appellees because the response, refusing to comply with the request on the ground that it was too broad and too burdensome, was in direct conflict with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and with the court's case law interpreting the FOIA.Daugherty v.

     Because not all of the emails that were requested by a newspaper were “public records” pursuant to subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section, but there was not enough evidence to discern which of them were “public records”, an in camera review was needed to make that determination. The definition of “public records” under the Freedom of Information Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> et seq., was content-driven, and the only way to determine the content was to examine the emails because an analysis of messages based solely on the context in which they were created, without an examination of the content of the messages, was insufficient to determine whether the messages were “public records”.Pulaski County v. Ark. Democrat-Gazette, Inc., 370 Ark. 435, 260 S.W.3d 718 (2007).

     Trial court erred by finding that appellees'requirement that the driver pay a deposit of $2, 475 to obtain the requested records did not violate the Freedom of Information Act because §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-109" target="_self">25-19-109</a></cite> did not apply, as the driver stated that she requested only copies of the recordings and did not ask for any type of special conversion or any type of compilation. The applicable provision to the driver's request was subsection (d) of this section, as she simply requested a copy of the files, and therefore appellees could not charge fees that exceeded the cost of reproduction and could not include the hourly rate of a captain in assessing costs to the driver.Daugherty v. Jacksonville Police Dep't, 2012 Ark. 264, 411 S.W.3d 196 (2012).

        When a teacher made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a school district (district) after the teacher was terminated, and the denial of that request was reviewed in the same case in which the termination was contested, a trial court had no jurisdiction to grant the district's renewed motion for a protective order because (1) the order was sought under Ark. R. Civ. P. 26(c), which was independent of the FOIA, and (2) the renewed motion initiated no FOIA case, as the district was the records custodian and only a citizen could seek review of the denial of an FOIA request, and the motion was litigated while the termination case was on appeal.Hollis v. Fayetteville Sch. Dist. No. 1, 2016 Ark. App. 132, 485 S.W.3d 280 (2016).

     Litigation files prepared by an attorney hired by private medical malpractice liability insurance carriers to represent three doctors who worked for the state university were not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> to<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-110" target="_self">25-19-110</a></cite>, because the documents were not public records for purposes of subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section. As the doctors were sued in their personal capacity, simply changing the records request to name the doctors in their official capacity did not convert the documents from private to public; the documents were also attorney work-product and subject to the attorney-client privilege.Harrill &amp; Sutter, PLLC v.

        The Department of Finance and Administration (DF&A) was not required to fully disclose a company's successful bid proposal to the DF&A since the bid proposal fell under the competitive advantage exception and since disclosure would not only be detrimental to the successful bidder, but also to the DF&A in the quality of information it would receive to requests for proposals in the future.

The circuit court's conclusion that county officials were unnecessary parties to a dispute over access to their public records was clearly erroneous.Apprentice Info. Sys. v.

     Unredacted access to certain accident reports should have been granted to an attorney seeking clients for his law practice because the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2721–2725, did not prohibit information contained in such reports from being released under the Freedom of Information Act. A vehicle accident report is not included in the definition of a “motor vehicle record,” regardless of whether, as a matter of convenience, some of the information included in an accident report may be taken from or verified by a database maintained by the Office of Motor Vehicles. Moreover, “personal information” does not include information on vehicular accidents.Ark. State Police v.

        Attorney-client privilege is not one of exceptions of this section. Ark. Hwy. & Transp. Dep't v. Hope Brick Works, Inc., 294 Ark. 490, 744 S.W.2d 711 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a criminal case is closed by administrative action, the reason for the exemption under subdivision (b)(6) no longer exists, and statements previously exempted thereby may be released. McCambridge v. City of Little Rock, 298 Ark. 219, 766 S.W.2d 909 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applying the general rule of prospectivity which governs interpretation of statutes, the application of the May 14, 1990, version of Rule 7 of the Rules of Judicial Discipline & Disability Commission is prospective, and thus the Judicial Discipline & Disability Commission is not required to divulge its actions prior to that time which were protected under the former rule and statute. Gannett River States Pub. Co. v. Arkansas Judicial Discipline & Disability Com., 304 Ark. 244, 801 S.W.2d 292 (1990).

        Because only the General Assembly can create exceptions to this chapter, a statute must specifically provide for nondisclosure before a court will exempt a public record from the chapter. Troutt Bros. v. Emison, 311 Ark. 27, 841 S.W.2d 604 (1992).

       <p>
        The home addresses of 2 police officers, which were sought by the plaintiff in a civil action so as to decrease his cost of service of process, were exempt from disclosure as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Stilley v. McBride, 332 Ark. 306, 965 S.W.2d 125 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly denied an attorney's request for information under the employee-evaluation/job-performance exemption in subdivision (c)(1) of this section, because the records of a decision to suspend or terminate a police officer following an investigation into a citizen's complaint by one of the attorney's clients were job-performance records that were not subject to release where the officer was not on duty during the encounters, the client was not arrested, and there was no decision to suspend or terminate the officer.Hyman v. Sadler, 2018 Ark. App. 82, 539 S.W.3d 642 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        School district properly withheld records pertaining to investigations involving two altercations that occurred between a student and teachers where the records fit within the definition of employee-evaluation and job-performance records and the examples provided in attorney general opinions, and there was no evidence that the records were not created by the employer concerning the teachers'performance in regard to the specific incidents.Davis v. Van Buren Sch. Dist., 2019 Ark. App. 157, 572 S.W.3d 466 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Records pertaining to investigations involving two altercations that occurred between a student and teachers did not fit within the exception in subdivision (c)(1) of this section, as there was no final administrative resolution of any suspension or termination proceeding at which the records formed a basis to suspend or terminate the teachers, it was undisputed that neither teacher was suspended or terminated as a result of the records, and one teacher's resignation occurred before any administrative hearing, resolution, or appeal.Davis v. Van Buren Sch. Dist., 2019 Ark. App. 157, 572 S.W.3d 466 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the high level of publicity and media attention threatened to interfere with defendant's right to a fair trial, the closing of the investigation files of the state police and the files of all investigative agencies, including a legislative audit, by the court, was warranted to ensure the defendant's right to a fair trial. Arkansas Gazette Co. v. Goodwin, 304 Ark. 204, 801 S.W.2d 284 (Ark. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly found that a prison transport manifest did not fall within the scope of the “undisclosed investigation” exception to the Freedom of Information Act of 1967 because the manifest was simply a record kept in the regular course of business and was not investigatory in nature such that the exemption would apply.Holladay v. Glass, 2017 Ark. App. 595, 534 S.W.3d 173 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hospital statements taken from witnesses as part of a quality assurance or peer review proceeding were excluded from disclosure and were absolutely privileged communications pursuant to Arkansas statutes. Berry v. Saline Mem. Hosp., 322 Ark. 182, 907 S.W.2d 736 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court did not err in ordering a school district to provide electronic copies of paper records at no charge under the Freedom of Information Act of 1967; the school district could scan the paper records and provide them electronically, and the circuit court did not clearly err in finding in this case that the records were “readily available” in an electronic medium.Pulaski Cty. Special Sch. Dist. v. Delaney, 2019 Ark. App. 210, 575 S.W.3d 420 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        School district could not refuse a request under the Freedom of Information Act of 1967 to be provided 1,816 pages of records in an electronic format on the ground that the request was too voluminous or burdensome due to the scanning process. In addition, there is no provision in this section that permits a custodian to decide what medium it will provide records to a citizen based on the number of records the school district must redact or the school district's preference to have a hard copy of the documents.Pulaski Cty. Special Sch. Dist. v. Delaney, 2019 Ark. App. 210, 575 S.W.3d 420 (2019).

        If a law enforcement investigation remains open and ongoing it is one meant to be protected as “undisclosed” under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. Martin v. Musteen, 303 Ark. 656, 799 S.W.2d 540 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court will have to decide, as a matter of fact in each case, whether investigations are ongoing or not for purposes of applying the exemption provided in subdivision (b)(6). Martin v. Musteen, 303 Ark. 656, 799 S.W.2d 540 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In ordering the Arkansas State Police to release case file records to a murder victim's family pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act of 1967, the circuit court did not clearly err when it found that the investigation into the victim's murder in 1963 was not open and ongoing, as no charges had been brought or appeared to be imminent. The victim's family and the public were entitled to know how law enforcement officials performed their duties.Dep't of Ark. State Police v. Keech Law Firm, P.A., 2017 Ark. 143, 516 S.W.3d 265 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption from disclosure under subdivision (b)(6) of this section requires an investigation to be open and ongoing to qualify for nondisclosure. Whether an investigation is open and ongoing is by necessity a question of fact to be determined on a case-by-case basis.Dep't of Ark. State Police v. Keech Law Firm, P.A., 2017 Ark. 143, 516 S.W.3d 265 (2017).

     Pursuant to this section, while the contractor possessed the records requested, it was not an entity covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> et seq., which would render it subject to suit under the FOIA; therefore, the association's suit was reversed and dismissed.Nabholz Constr.

        Subdivision (b)(10) requires that the public's right to knowledge of records be weighed against an individual's right to privacy, so that when the public's interest is substantial, it will usually outweigh any individual privacy interests, and disclosure will be favored. Young v. Rice, 308 Ark. 593, 826 S.W.2d 252 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the release of records could subject candidates for police lieutenant to embarrassment, and perhaps threaten their future employment, release would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of the candidates' personal privacy; although the public's interest in knowing that its safety is protected by the best-qualified police lieutenant is also substantial, it was served by the release of the report forms, even though the candidates' identities remained unknown. Young v. Rice, 308 Ark. 593, 826 S.W.2d 252 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In connection with the claim that the home address of a ratepayer should not be disclosed, the department made a policy argument that since a public employee's personal contact information was exempted from disclosure, so should that of a private customer, but it was the job of the General Assembly to establish exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act, and arguments for additional exemptions had to be addressed to the General Assembly, not the court.Hopkins v. City of Brinkley, 2014 Ark. 139, 432 S.W.3d 609 (2014).

     Records of intercollegiate conference on the amount of money that its member institutions disbursed to its student athletes records were not “educational” records under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, and were not closed to the public because they were not individual education or academic records. Arkansas Gazette Co. v. Southern State College, 273 Ark. 248, 620 S.W.2d 258 (1981), dismissed, <cite class="us_code">455 U.S. 931</cite>, <cite class="s_court">102 S. Ct. 1416</cite> (1982).

        Judgment was properly awarded to appellee in an action against a police chief, in the chief's capacity as the custodian of records for the police department, for violation of the Arkansas FOIA because an officer's use-of-force reports describing an incident with appellee did not fall within the exemption in subdivision (c)(1) of this section for employee evaluation or job performance records.Thomas v.

     Circuit court's determination that §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-104" target="_self">25-19-104</a></cite> and this section were unconstitutional was improper because declaratory relief was inappropriate under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.16.html#t16c111s16-111-104" target="_blank">16-111-104</a></cite> as appellees did not yet have a case or controversy ready for decision by the courts.

     City administrator's succession of one-on-one conversations with each member of the city's board of directors violated the “open meetings” provision of the Freedom of Information Act, §§<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> —<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-109" target="_self">25-19-109</a></cite>; through its conversations the board held a meeting within the intent of the FOIA such that the city's actions resulted in a consensus being reached on a given issue, thus rendering the formal meeting held before the public a mere charade. Harris v. City of Fort Smith, 86 Ark. App. 20, 158 S.W.3d 733 (2004), aff'd, 359 Ark. 355, 197 S.W.3d 461 (2004).

        This chapter repealed former open meetings law by implication and thus, since no advance notice of emergency meetings of school board were required unless requested by the news media under this section, approval of $150,000 bond issue by electors of school district was not void for failure to give notice of meetings.

        Subsection (b)(2) of this section provides that the news media located in the county where the meeting is held and those located elsewhere that cover regular meetings of the body may request that they be notified of special and emergency meetings; absent such a request, no notice to them is required.

        It is not the bare decision whether or not to discipline an employee that the executive session provision allows to be made in privacy, but rather the discussion or consideration of particular acts or omissions of the employee whose conduct has been called into question so as to avoid adverse publicity and unjustified damage to the reputation of individuals, allegations against whom later prove unwarranted. Commercial Printing Co. v. Rush, 261 Ark. 468, 549 S.W.2d 790 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a decision has been made in executive session that discipline or other action is needed, all further acts of the board should be public, and the public officials accountable and answerable for their actions. Commercial Printing Co. v. Rush, 261 Ark. 468, 549 S.W.2d 790 (1977).

        A meeting of the credentials committee of the medical staff of a county hospital for the hearing of testimony and a vote on whether the staff privileges of a doctor should be continued was required to be held in public, since the doctor's status was that of an individual who has certain privileges extended to him by a publicly owned, operated and supported county hospital; however, the discussion or consideration of the specific issue by the committee members could be conducted in executive session.

No decision was made through the use of email; the emails contained information, a recommendation, and unsolicited responses with no decision, and the city board of directors discussed the proposed rule change at a public meeting.City of Fort Smith v.

        Where the circumstances do not suggest either arbitrary or bad faith conduct, an award of fees and costs is not warranted. Depoyster v. Cole, 298 Ark. 203, 766 S.W.2d 606 (1989), overruled in part, Harris v. City of Fort Smith, 366 Ark. 277, 234 S.W.3d 875 (2006).

        The trial court need not make a fee award in every Freedom of Information Act case; the purpose of the fee-shifting provision is to assess fees and costs where public officials have acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in withholding records.

     The appellant was properly denied attorneys' fees where (1) the record indicated that he was never denied access to the documents requested, and that the appellee voluntarily provided the requested documents when he became aware of their location and status, and (2) the appellant filed his action for attorneys' fees only one business day after filing his FOIA request, in violation of §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105ol1e" target="_self">25-19-105(e)</a></cite>.

        The trial court's finding that a volunteer fire department had substantial justification for refusing disclosure of requested records was clearly erroneous and, therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in denying the appellant's petition for attorney's fees, notwithstanding the fire department's assertion that it was justified in believing that it was not subject to the FOIA because its only connection to public funding was indirect support via state and federal loans, where the fire department performed public safety and utility functions traditionally performed by governmental entities by providing fire protection and water service pursuant to its contractual arrangement with a fire protection district and received funding from a public source.

     Arkansas Department of Human Services was a department of the State of Arkansas, and a suit against a state official in his official capacity was not a suit against that person but, rather, was a suit against that official's office, thus, even though the individual prevailed in obtaining certain public records under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-101" target="_self">25-19-101</a></cite> et seq., under subsection (d) of this section, no award of attorney's fees could be assessed against either the Department or the director, who was acting as a state official in his official capacity; further, as an individual, the director had no administrative control of the public records as he would have had control of the public records only in his official capacity.

        Circuit court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees under subsection (d) of this section because the mother of a decedent who died in police custody did not even partially prevail on her FOIA claim, let alone substantially prevail, where the circuit court's order specifically found that the city police department had responded promptly and provided public records as quickly as possible but that the records of its internal affairs department were not subject to disclosure.City of Little Rock v.

        There was no abuse of discretion on the part of the circuit court in awarding an inmate's aunt attorney's fees under the Freedom of Information Act of 1967 because the aunt substantially prevailed, and the fact that the sergeant believed that the manifest was investigatory and, therefore, exempt did not mean that the sergeant was justified in so believing.Holladay v.

        When a teacher made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a school district (district) after the teacher was terminated, and the denial of that request was reviewed in the same case in which the termination was contested, a trial court had no jurisdiction to grant the district's renewed motion for a protective order because (1) the order was sought under Ark. R. Civ. P. 26(c), which was independent of the FOIA, and (2) the renewed motion initiated no FOIA case, as the district was the records custodian and only a citizen could seek review of the denial of an FOIA request, and the motion was litigated while the termination case was on appeal.Hollis v. Fayetteville Sch. Dist. No. 1, 2016 Ark. App. 132, 485 S.W.3d 280 (2016).

       Trial court erred by finding that appellees'requirement that the driver pay a deposit of $2, 475 to obtain the requested records did not violate the Freedom of Information Act because this section did not apply, as the driver stated that she requested only copies of the recordings and did not ask for any type of special conversion or any type of compilation. The applicable provision to the driver's request was §<cite class="ocga"><a href="#t25c19s25-19-105ol1d" target="_self">25-19-105(d)</a></cite>, as she simply requested a copy of the files, and therefore appellees could not charge fees that exceeded the cost of reproduction and could not include the hourly rate of a captain in assessing costs to the driver.Daugherty v.

       25-19-107. Appeal from denial of rights — Attorney's fees.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any citizen denied the rights granted to him or her by this chapter may appeal immediately from the denial to the Pulaski County Circuit Court or to the circuit court of the residence of the aggrieved party, if the State of Arkansas or a department, agency, or institution of the state is involved, or to any of the circuit courts of the appropriate judicial districts when an agency of a county, municipality, township, or school district, or a private organization supported by or expending public funds, is involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon written application of the person denied the rights provided for in this chapter, or any interested party, it shall be mandatory upon the circuit court having jurisdiction to fix and assess a day the petition is to be heard within seven (7) days of the date of the application of the petitioner, and to hear and determine the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those who refuse to comply with the orders of the court shall be found guilty of contempt of court.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)In any action to enforce the rights granted by this chapter, or in any appeal therefrom, the court shall assess against the defendant reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation expenses reasonably incurred by a plaintiff who has substantially prevailed unless the court finds that the position of the defendant was substantially justified .
     </p>
     <p>
      If the defendant has substantially prevailed in the action, the court may assess expenses against the plaintiff only upon a finding that the action was initiated primarily for frivolous or dilatory purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1)Notwithstanding subsection (d)(1) of this section, the court shall not assess reasonable attorney's fees or other litigation expenses reasonably incurred by a plaintiff against the State of Arkansas or a department, agency, or institution of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      (A)A plaintiff who substantially prevailed in an action under this section against the State of Arkansas or a department, agency, or institution of the state may file a claim with the Arkansas State Claims Commission to recover reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation expenses reasonably incurred.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   A claim for reasonable attorney's fees and litigation expenses reasonably incurred in an action against the State of Arkansas or a department, agency, or institution of the state shall be filed with the commission pursuant to §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.19.html#t19c10s19-10-201" target="_blank">19-10-201</a></cite> et seq. within sixty (60) days of the final disposition of the appeal under subsection (a) of this section.

        Effective Dates. Acts 2001, No. 905, § 21: Mar. 19, 2001. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly that modern commerce in this State requires the use of, and will be facilitated by electronic signatures and electronic transactions, that presently Arkansas law is preempted by federal law concerning that subject matter by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act; that under the federal act the federal preemption may be largely and immediately be displaced by the enactment of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; that the latter act contains provisions not contained in the current act and the additional provisions would be of immediate advantage to electronic commerce in Arkansas; and the latter act has already been adopted in over two-dozen states, resulting in potential economic advantage to those states over Arkansas. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date the last house overrides the veto.”

Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2007.”

      If a law other than this chapter requires a record (i) to be posted or displayed in a certain manner, (ii) to be sent, communicated, or transmitted by a specified method, or (iii) to contain information that is formatted in a certain manner, the following rules apply:

       25-32-116. Transferable records.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In this section, “transferable record” means an electronic record that:
     </p>
     <p>
      A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.
     </p>
     <p>
      A system satisfies subsection (b), and a person is deemed to have control of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that:
     </p>
     <p>
      a single authoritative copy of the transferable record exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), unalterable;
     </p>
     <p>
      the authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control of a transferable record is the holder, as defined in §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.04.html#t04c01s4-1-201" target="_blank">4-1-201</a></cite> of the Uniform Commercial Code, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.04.html#t04c01s4-1-101" target="_blank">4-1-101</a></cite> et seq., of the transferable record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an equivalent record or writing under the Uniform Commercial Code, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.04.html#t04c01s4-1-101" target="_blank">4-1-101</a></cite> et seq., including, if the applicable statutory requirements under §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.04.html#t04c03s4-3-302ol1a" target="_blank">4-3-302(a)</a></cite>, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.04.html#t04c07s4-7-501" target="_blank">4-7-501</a></cite>, or §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.04.html#t04c09s4-9-308" target="_blank">4-9-308</a></cite> of the Uniform Commercial Code, § 4-1-101 et seq., are satisfied, the rights and defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated, or a purchaser, respectively. Delivery, possession, and indorsement are not required to obtain or exercise any of the rights under this subsection.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   Except as otherwise agreed, an obligor under a transferable record has the same rights and defenses as an equivalent obligor under equivalent records or writings under the Uniform Commercial Code, §<cite class="ocga"><a href="gov.ga.ocga.title.04.html#t04c01s4-1-101" target="_blank">4-1-101</a></cite> et seq.
     </p>
     <p>
      If requested by a person against which enforcement is sought, the person seeking to enforce the transferable record shall provide reasonable proof that the person is in control of the transferable record. Proof may include access to the authoritative copy of the transferable record and related business records sufficient to review the terms of the transferable record and to establish the identity of the person having control of the transferable record.

         <p>
          “(a)(1)(A)The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may create paying accounts on his or her books and on the books of the Treasurer of the State and Auditor of State for the payment of all personal services and operating expenses of the Department of Agriculture.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(B)Upon prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative Council, or if meeting in Legislative Session the Joint Budget Committee, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the state shall direct the transfer of funds and appropriations to the Shared Services Paying Account appropriation section of this act and the transfer of positions to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services appropriation section of this act on the books of the Treasurer of State, the Auditor of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State. (2) The transfer authority provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section for efficiencies and to eliminate duplication of services are limited only to those services that are provided for multiple divisions of a department, including without limitation to administration, human resources, procurement, communications, fleet operations, and information services.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(2)The transfer authority provided to the department in subdivision (a)(1) of this section may be used to make transfers only within the department's appropriation act or between other appropriation acts authorized for the department.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(b)(1)Each department utilizing the Shared Services Paying Account section or Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act shall submit a report to be included in the Budget Manuals for hearings, conducted by the General Assembly, listing all shared services transfers of positions, funds, and appropriation under this section, which shall be submitted as instructed by the Department of Finance and Administration — Office of Budget for uniformity.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(3)A report submitted under subdivision (b)(1) of this section shall include the following:
         </p>
         <p>
          “(A)The position number, authorized position title, class code, grade, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the position being transferred to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act; and
         </p>
         <p>
          “(B)The fund center, appropriation, appropriation amount, commitment item or items, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the fund or appropriation being transferred to the Shared Services Paying Account.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(c)(1)It is the intent of the Ninety-Second General Assembly that the authority under this section to transfer positions is intended for use for the time period prior to Fiscal Year 2022 to allow cabinet-level departments to establish a centralized Regular Salaries — Shared Services section, with the recommendation that the position transfer authority granted under this section be discontinued after that time.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(2)The Bureau of Legislative Research shall bring the recommendation in subdivision (c)(1) of this section to the attention of the chairs conducting the 2021 Regular Session pre-session budget hearings, the chairs of the Special Language Subcommittee, and the members of the Special Language Subcommittee during pre-session budget hearings.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(d)Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a cabinet-level department each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by delineating the maximums in the appropriation act or acts and establishing authorized positions and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the cabinet-level departments created under Acts 2019, No. 910, may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided as authorized under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(e)The provisions of this section shall be in effect from the date of passage through June 30, 2021”.

         <p>
          Effective Dates. Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

         <p>
          “(a)(1)(A)The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may create paying accounts on his or her books and on the books of the Treasurer of State and the Auditor of State for the payment of personal services and operating expenses by the Department of Education.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(B)Upon prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative Council, or if meeting in Legislative Session the Joint Budget Committee, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall direct the transfer of funds and appropriations to the Shared Services Paying Account appropriation section of this act and the transfer of positions to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services appropriation section of this act on the books of the Treasurer of State, the Auditor of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(2)The transfer authority provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section for efficiencies and to eliminate duplication of services are limited only to those services that are provided for multiple divisions of a department, including without limitation to administration, human resources, procurement, communications, fleet operations, and information services.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(3)The transfer authority provided to the department in subdivision (a)(1) of this section may be used to make transfers only within the department's appropriation act or between other appropriation acts authorized for the department.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(b)(1)Each department utilizing the Shared Services Paying Account section or Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act shall submit a report to be included in the Budget Manuals for hearings, conducted by the General Assembly, listing all shared services transfers of positions, funds, and appropriation under this section, which shall be submitted as instructed by the Department of Finance and Administration — Office of Budget for uniformity.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(2)A report submitted under subdivision (b)(1) of this section shall include the following:
         </p>
         <p>
          “(A)The position number, authorized position title, class code, grade, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the position being transferred to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act; and
         </p>
         <p>
          “(B)The fund center, appropriation, appropriation amount, commitment item or items, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the fund or appropriation being transferred to the Shared Services Paying Account.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(c)(1)It is the intent of the Ninety-Second General Assembly that the authority under this section to transfer positions is intended for use for the time period prior to Fiscal Year 2022 to allow cabinet-level departments to establish a centralized Regular Salaries — Shared Services section, with the recommendation that the position transfer authority granted under this section be discontinued after that time.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(2)The Bureau of Legislative Research shall bring the recommendation in subdivision (c)(1) of this section to the attention of the chairs conducting the 2021 Regular Session pre-session budget hearings, the chairs of the Special Language Subcommittee, and the members of the Special Language Subcommittee during pre-session budget hearings.
         </p>
         <p>
          “(d)Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a cabinet-level department each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by delineating the maximums in the appropriation act or acts and establishing authorized positions and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the cabinet-level departments created under Acts 2019, No. 910, may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided as authorized under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.

Further, the General Assembly has determined that the cabinet-level departments created under Acts 2019, No. 910, may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided as authorized under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as provided by this section.

        A.C.R.C. Notes. Acts 2020, No. 96, § 22, provided: “SHARED SERVICES.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a)(1)(A)The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may create paying accounts on his or her books and on the books of the Treasurer of State and the Auditor of State for the payment of personal services and operating expenses by the Department of Health.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(B)Upon prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative Council, or if meeting in Legislative Session the Joint Budget Committee, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall direct the transfer of funds and appropriations to the Shared Services Paying Account appropriation section of this act and the transfer of positions to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services appropriation section of this act on the books of the Treasurer of State, the Auditor of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2)The transfer authority provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section for efficiencies and to eliminate duplication of services are limited only to those services that are provided for multiple divisions of a department, including without limitation to administration, human resources, procurement, communications, fleet operations, and information services.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3)The transfer authority provided to the department in subdivision (a)(1) of this section may be used to make transfers only within the department's appropriation act or between other appropriation acts authorized for the department.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b)(1)Each department utilizing the Shared Services Paying Account section or Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act shall submit a report to be included in the Budget Manuals for hearings, conducted by the General Assembly, listing all shared services transfers of positions, funds, and appropriation under this section, which shall be submitted as instructed by the Department of Finance and Administration — Office of Budget for uniformity.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2)A report submitted under subdivision (b)(1) of this section shall include the following:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(A)The position number, authorized position title, class code, grade, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the position being transferred to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(B)The fund center, appropriation, appropriation amount, commitment item or items, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the fund or appropriation being transferred to the Shared Services Paying Account.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c)(1)It is the intent of the Ninety-Second General Assembly that the authority under this section to transfer positions is intended for use for the time period prior to Fiscal Year 2022 to allow cabinet-level departments to establish a centralized Regular Salaries — Shared Services section, with the recommendation that the position transfer authority granted under this section be discontinued after that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2)The Bureau of Legislative Research shall bring the recommendation in subdivision (c)(1) of this section to the attention of the chairs conducting the 2021 Regular Session pre-session budget hearings, the chairs of the Special Language Subcommittee, and the members of the Special Language Subcommittee during pre-session budget hearings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d)Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a cabinet-level department each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by delineating the maximums in the appropriation act or acts and establishing authorized positions and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the cabinet-level departments created under Acts 2019, No. 910, may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided as authorized under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e)The provisions of this section shall be in effect from the date of passage through June 30, 2021”.
       </p>
       <p>
        Effective Dates. Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

        “(d)Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a cabinet-level department each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by delineating the maximums in the appropriation act or acts and establishing authorized positions and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the cabinet-level departments created under Acts 2019, No. 910, may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided as authorized under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.

     </p>
     <p>
      “(a)(1)(A)The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may create paying accounts on his or her books and on the books of the Treasurer of State and the Auditor of State for the payment of personal services and operating expenses by the Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(B)Upon prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative Council, or if meeting in Legislative Session the Joint Budget Committee, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall direct the transfer of funds and appropriations to the Shared Services Paying Account appropriation section of this act and the transfer of positions to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services appropriation section of this act on the books of the Treasurer of State, the Auditor of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(2)The transfer authority provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section for efficiencies and to eliminate duplication of services are limited only to those services that are provided for multiple divisions of a department, including without limitation to administration, human resources, procurement, communications, fleet operations, and information services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(3)The transfer authority provided to the department in subdivision (a)(1) of this section may be used to make transfers only within the department's appropriation act or between other appropriation acts authorized for the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b)(1)Each department utilizing the Shared Services Paying Account section or Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act shall submit a report to be included in the Budget Manuals for hearings, conducted by the General Assembly, listing all shared services transfers of positions, funds, and appropriation under this section, which shall be submitted as instructed by the Department of Finance and Administration — Office of Budget for uniformity.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(2)A report submitted under subdivision (b)(1) of this section shall include the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      “(A)The position number, authorized position title, class code, grade, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the position being transferred to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “(B)The fund center, appropriation, appropriation amount, commitment item or items, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the fund or appropriation being transferred to the Shared Services Paying Account.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c)(1)It is the intent of the Ninety-Second General Assembly that the authority under this section to transfer positions is intended for use for the time period prior to Fiscal Year 2022 to allow cabinet-level departments to establish a centralized Regular Salaries — Shared Services section, with the recommendation that the position transfer authority granted under this section be discontinued after that time.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(2)The Bureau of Legislative Research shall bring the recommendation in subdivision (c)(1) of this section to the attention of the chairs conducting the 2021 Regular Session pre-session budget hearings, the chairs of the Special Language Subcommittee, and the members of the Special Language Subcommittee during pre-session budget hearings.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(d)Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a cabinet-level department each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by delineating the maximums in the appropriation act or acts and establishing authorized positions and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the cabinet-level departments created under Acts 2019, No. 910, may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided as authorized under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
     </p>

      “(e)The provisions of this section shall be in effect from the date of passage through June 30, 2021”.

    A.C.R.C. Notes. Acts 2020, No. 97, § 45, provided: “SHARED SERVICES.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(a)(1)(A)The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may create paying accounts on his or her books and on the books of the Treasurer of State and the Auditor of State for the payment of personal services and operating expenses by the Department of Public Safety.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(B)Upon prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative Council, or if meeting in Legislative Session the Joint Budget Committee, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall direct the transfer of funds and appropriations to the Shared Services Paying Account appropriation section of this act and the transfer of positions to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services appropriation section of this act on the books of the Treasurer of State, the Auditor of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(2)The transfer authority provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section for efficiencies and to eliminate duplication of services are limited only to those services that are provided for multiple divisions of a department, including without limitation to administration, human resources, procurement, communications, fleet operations, and information services.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(3)The transfer authority provided to the department in subdivision (a)(1) of this section may be used to make transfers only within the department's appropriation act or between other appropriation acts authorized for the department.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(b)(1)Each department utilizing the Shared Services Paying Account section or Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act shall submit a report to be included in the Budget Manuals for hearings, conducted by the General Assembly, listing all shared services transfers of positions, funds, and appropriation under this section, which shall be submitted as instructed by the Department of Finance and Administration — Office of Budget for uniformity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(2)A report submitted under subdivision (b)(1) of this section shall include the following:
   </p>
   <p>
    “(A)The position number, authorized position title, class code, grade, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the position being transferred to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act; and
   </p>
   <p>
    “(B)The fund center, appropriation, appropriation amount, commitment item or items, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the fund or appropriation being transferred to the Shared Services Paying Account.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(c)(1)It is the intent of the Ninety-Second General Assembly that the authority under this section to transfer positions is intended for use for the time period prior to Fiscal Year 2022 to allow cabinet-level departments to establish a centralized Regular Salaries — Shared Services section, with the recommendation that the position transfer authority granted under this section be discontinued after that time.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(2)The Bureau of Legislative Research shall bring the recommendation in subdivision (c)(1) of this section to the attention of the chairs conducting the 2021 Regular Session pre-session budget hearings, the chairs of the Special Language Subcommittee, and the members of the Special Language Subcommittee during pre-session budget hearings.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(d)Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a cabinet-level department each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by delineating the maximums in the appropriation act or acts and establishing authorized positions and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the cabinet-level departments created under Acts 2019, No. 910, may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided as authorized under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(e)The provisions of this section shall be in effect from the date of passage through June 30, 2021”.
   </p>
   <p>
    Effective Dates. Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.

    A.C.R.C. Notes. Acts 2020, No. 182, § 13, provided: “SHARED SERVICES.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(a)(1)(A)The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may create paying accounts on his or her books and on the books of the Treasurer of State and the Auditor of State for the payment of personal services and operating expenses by the Department of Transformation and Shared Services.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(B)Upon prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative Council, or if meeting in Legislative Session the Joint Budget Committee, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall direct the transfer of funds and appropriations to the Shared Services Paying Account appropriation section of this act and the transfer of positions to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services appropriation section of this act on the books of the Treasurer of State, the Auditor of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(2)The transfer authority provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section for efficiencies and to eliminate duplication of services are limited only to those services that are provided for multiple divisions of a department, including without limitation to administration, human resources, procurement, communications, fleet operations, and information services.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(3)The transfer authority provided to the department in subdivision (a)(1) of this section may be used to make transfers only within the department's appropriation act or between other appropriation acts authorized for the department.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(b)(1)Each department utilizing the Shared Services Paying Account section or Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act shall submit a report to be included in the Budget Manuals for hearings, conducted by the General Assembly, listing all shared services transfers of positions, funds, and appropriation under this section, which shall be submitted as instructed by the Department of Finance and Administration — Office of Budget for uniformity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(2)A report submitted under subdivision (b)(1) of this section shall include the following:
   </p>
   <p>
    “(A)The position number, authorized position title, class code, grade, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the position being transferred to the Regular Salaries — Shared Services section of this act; and
   </p>
   <p>
    “(B)The fund center, appropriation, appropriation amount, commitment item or items, business area, and name of the division, section, or unit for the fund or appropriation being transferred to the Shared Services Paying Account.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(c)(1)It is the intent of the Ninety-Second General Assembly that the authority under this section to transfer positions is intended for use for the time period prior to Fiscal Year 2022 to allow cabinet-level departments to establish a centralized Regular Salaries — Shared Services section, with the recommendation that the position transfer authority granted under this section be discontinued after that time.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(2)The Bureau of Legislative Research shall bring the recommendation in subdivision (c)(1) of this section to the attention of the chairs conducting the 2021 Regular Session pre-session budget hearings, the chairs of the Special Language Subcommittee, and the members of the Special Language Subcommittee during pre-session budget hearings.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(d)Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding for a cabinet-level department each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by delineating the maximums in the appropriation act or acts and establishing authorized positions and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the cabinet-level departments created under Acts 2019, No. 910, may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided as authorized under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or, if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(e)The provisions of this section shall be in effect from the date of passage through June 30, 2021”.
   </p>
   <p>
    Effective Dates. Acts 2019, No. 910, § 6346(b): July 1, 2019. Emergency clause provided: “It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this act revises the duties of certain state entities; that this act establishes new departments of the state; that these revisions impact the expenses and operations of state government; and that the sections of this act other than the two uncodified sections of this act preceding the emergency clause titled ‘Funding and classification of cabinet-level department secretaries’ and ‘Transformation and Efficiencies Act transition team’ should become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year to allow for implementation of the new provisions at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and Sections 1 through 6343 of this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2019”.
